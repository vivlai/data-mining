      "My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible. The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.\n",
      "If you need an inexpensive place to stay for a night or two then you may consider this place but for a longer stay I'd recommend somewhere with better amenities. Pros: Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location. Very clean and very good maid service Cons: Tiny rooms Uncomfortable bed Absolutely no amenities No phone in room No wardrobe Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me... If you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into.\n",
      "Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere. Wir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nächte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht. Das Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben. Unser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen. Sonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig. Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte. Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort. Das Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh. Für ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. ---- [1] http://www.yelp.de/biz/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw\n",
      "Location is everything and this hotel has it! The reception is inviting and open 24 hours. They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!\n",
      "gute lage im stadtzentrum. shoppingmeile und sehenswürdigkeiten, sowie gute pubs in laufweite. das hotel ist neu, gut gepflegt und hat bemühtes/nettes personal. ideal für einen kurztrip nach edinburgh. längere aufenthalte eher nicht, da die zimmer recht klein sind.\n",
      "Erstklassige Lage. Dazu ist alles geschrieben worden. Wir hatten Zimmer 718 mit Blick auf den Bahnhof. Ist zwar zu laut mit offenen Fenster nachts, aber der Ausblick verzeiht alles. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und super hilfsbereit. Wer Edinburgh zu Fuß erkunden möchte, ist hier perfekt aufgehoben.\n",
      "Beautiful space, great location, staff rock. Tiny room, but this was expected. Bathroom amazing. Walls, however, paper thin, which is why I can barely string a sentence together in this review.\n",
      "This is a fairly new property I think. It is a German company and has most of the amenities you would want. It is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank. Location is really good. Near the Royal Mile and Waverley station without being too noisy. Very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. Has WiFi but we did have to re-log in every day.\n",
      "First time at this group of hotels. Pretty new, only one in UK, another to open in Edinburgh and one in London. Rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in Edinburgh. Rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!\n",
      "Location location location! Motel One is just right in the middle of everything. To one side you have the New town and the main trains station ( and right in front of the airport bus) and on the other side the beautiful old town of Edinburg. The room was small but clean and with all you need. The bathroom was also small but nice and clean and the shower was big and good! Next to the bed there is a European plug (CC 7/7) so we actually didn't need to use our adapter. The beed was to hard for my back and I prefer the bed more soft, but I will still come back to Edinburgh and Motel One.\n",
      "A hotel that has all the basics that you'd need - no additional fuss. For the price we paid, I'd say this place is actually pretty good value. The location is super central and it's easy to get to everywhere from here! It's also right next to the airport shuttle bus and train station, so transport is also easy. The insides is a bit of a maze depending on where your room is located - you may have to go down to go up to go back down again to get to your room! But no bother, it's good for walking off the chips and sobering from your drinks.\n",
      "Stayed here for two nights, costs was £109 per night for two people sharing a room which was not a budget price for what felt like budget rooms. Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom. No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. Don't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel. If I go to Edinburgh again I will book a different hotel.\n",
      "Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. Breakfast is ok, but not more. Service is friendly. No twin rooms available..\n",
      "I really do love the Germans. This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time. Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning. My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer.\n",
      "Motel One sets the standard for budget hotels. I stayed at the Dusseldorf branch a while ago so when I saw one in Edinburgh, I knew this was the place to book. We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels. Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional. We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus. Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength. The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee. If I am looking for a reasonable hotel in a city, Motel One will be by first choice.\n",
      "Had Continental style breakfast here a short distance from Waverley Station as I had half hour before a train home and wanted to try somewhere new. Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel. I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in. Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck. Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required. Maybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!\n",
      "This place is horrible, we were so excited to try it since I got a gift card for my birthday. We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!\n",
      "For being fairly \"fast\" food.. Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable.\n",
      "I decided to try it out, I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free... They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want. I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami! I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure! p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!\n",
      "I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted, far from it, it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food. With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants. the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name \"panda express\" (which is overpriced crap) the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use) I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially \"un-F$@k's\" your food and returns it to you. Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise.\n",
      "Sometimes the food is spot on and delicious and other times it is quite salty at this location. Very difficult to get a consistently good meal. Menu items add up quickly.\n",
      "Decent customer service but the food was awful. It was cold and had no sauce at all. I was expecting it to be good but this place really went down hill. I will never eat here again.\n",
      "Super clean restaurant and friendly staff. FRESH food. Hasn't been sitting under heat lamps. NO MSG, this is the good stuff. I have to have the Kung Pao Chicken weekly.\n",
      "Found this the other night. It is the PF Chang fast food option and it worked perfectly for us. Limited menu, but lower prices. Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating. Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's. Very busy, especially the take out. Glad to have it close\n",
      "The staff here is great and they're nice, wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it. Even good yelp reviews. I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering sauce as well. I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish. The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price. This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of our dishes. We didn't even eat half of our plates. We even refused to take it home with us. If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like, don't waste your time here.\n",
      "I had the garlic ginger broccoli chicken and it was not very good. The broccoli was hardly cooked and the sauce was way to sweet. Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise.\n",
      "This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service. We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food. The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay. We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location. The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink. That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore. We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order. It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly. They gave us a free appetizer. We do not expect perfection, nor free food. This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience. We would return again because they have good food and they care. That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture. Kudos to the manager for creating this culture. Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx\n",
      "I love this place i'd recommend it to anyone ! We always order it togo and it never disappoints! The food always taste fresh and is always ready on time! Definitely our favorite lunch spot !\n",
      "1st! Place is not closed. There was an issue with legal workers in the franchise chain. Now they are back! Food is one of the best! Especially their chicken mango! Daughter is a huge PF Chang fan, so she loves this place also! Her favorite is their Mongolian beef, and noodles! They are always coming up with something new, so you may have to try them more then a few times.\n",
      "Definitely not a fan. Coming from Orange County, CA, I have high expectations when it comes to Asian food. Suffice to say that Panda Express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad.\n",
      "Pretty good, not great. Definitely overpriced. It's barely a step up from Panda and not worth the price difference. Not saying it was bad, but $25 for two basic dishes is a bit much and they didn't make the order how I requested.\n",
      "I wish I could give 1.5 stars. Nothing special. Lack of flavor. The entrees were either sweet or spicy. The crab Rangoon were.....different. The filling had a mealy consistency. Friend rice was bland. Plenty of other places to spend 50$ on takeout. Save your money.\n",
      "Disappointed that on yelp their hours show them open at 1030am but when you arrive they don't open until 11am. Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here. Don't get me wrong the food is great as always but they need to fix this.\n",
      "1st visit had the lo mein...delish! 2nd visit had the teriyaki...fine if you like salt. Ick!\n",
      "As a vegetarian, it can difficult to find places with good options, but I love getting a tofu bowl at Pei Wei. The first time I had it, I had to double check because it looks and has a similar texture to meat, but it's great. I love going to Pei Wei\n",
      "Typical big business chinese place. Slightly fancy but very average food. Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small. Prices are higher than average. They offer a few different vegetarian options but it all tastes pretty bad do yourself a favor and also support a local business and eat at big buddha around the corner. Its much better food\n",
      "I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs. This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience.\n",
      "Great fresh food and clean restaurant. Friendly and very accommodating staff. I'm a frequent visitor. This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more.\n",
      "This is pretty good. My wife and I usually split lettuce wraps and an entree of some sort. It's convenient to be able to order take out online. Overall, if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house.\n",
      "Food is good and consistent and the service is always great. I've never dined in, but get take-out fairly often. I love being able to just say \"same as last time\" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time.\n",
      "The hubs and I dined at the Glendale location about two years ago. i guess we were hoping it was like PF Chang's....but unfortunately were dissapointed. We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my \"tried and true\" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken.\" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever! Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation. I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)! But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times... As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)\n",
      "Very clean and staff is always friendly. I usually order the honey seared chicken but decided to switch it up. I ordered the Thai dynamite and it had a weird, almost chemical taste. I will go back but will stick to my usual order.\n",
      "If I could give no stars I would. My family placed an order to be picked up and were told to be there at 7:20. We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8! Nobody acted like it was a big deal when I told them and just said \"oh.... Well we are running behind.\" Um okay?! We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home.\n",
      "I went to Surprise Pei Wei Restuarant tonight on Bell. This was my first visit to a Pei Wei. I was very impressed with the atmosphere, food and staff. The chicken teriyaki with fried rice was DELICIOUS. The spring rolls were delicious too! Your Pei Wei location is my new fav restaurant..\n",
      "I like Pei Wei overall and enjoy their varied menu selections. The food is good and fresh. Sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit though.\n",
      "Everything was good except Thai chicken wraps. Too much cilantro, absolute overkill. I think long stems is just yucky, cut them off!! Korean beef was ok but just missed the flavor I'm used to in this dish. Service is always spot on.\n",
      "I really don't understand how anyone can eat the food from here. Granted, I am Chinese and enjoy authentic food, however I like good Chinese American food. For someone who usually doesn't leave food on her plate unless it is really bad, I could not finish my meal because it was tasteless and below average.\n",
      "Went in for lunch with a coworker today. The small portions are overpriced and really aren't small-half would've been more than enough. We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food. All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.\n",
      "The food is great and customer service is the best! The Dan Dan noodles are dynamite but they come standard pretty spicy... I placed a pick up order by phone and asked for them to be mild, but they ended up being spicy! When I got home and tried to eat them they were too spicy. I called in and spoke to the manager and he took care of it completely and replaced the order for me at no charge!\n",
      "OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time. If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.\n",
      "My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now. One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too. Tonight we decided to try it out. I placed my order online. Easy process. My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers. Total for everything was $24.80 after tax. I drove down and picked up my food. The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too! Here is how everything tasted..................... Chicken Lo Mein- Only had a little of this. Good noodles, good white meat chicken. My wife liked it. Sesame Chicken/Steak- I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat. They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item. I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra). This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds. It was just alright. The flavors didn't really do much for me. It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland. I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too. I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-). The fried rice was good! Egg Roll- Eh. It was an egg roll. Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine. It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty. Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc. Deep Fried Pot Stickers- I got 2 of these things. They were good. Small but good. Straight pork filling in the middle of them. Overall it was just alright. I will say that they give you a GRIP of food. The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people. For $24.80 it was a great value. The food just wasn't the type of thing that you would ever crave and keep you coming back though. While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead. It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there. I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like. We shall see............\n",
      "Haven't eaten at this location in particular, but in general the prices are high for what you get. It's nothing special and any other Chinese place in the city can probably beat it in the price/quality area.\n",
      "Always on point. I get the Carmel chicken.. The crab wontons are a guilt must have. And I love there tea too. Ate her for two years and always pleased. Thx!\n",
      "I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is chill. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly.\n",
      "Came here with my friend today cause we were starving and decide to go whichever next place we saw. And we were very surprised at how pretty the inside of the restaurant looked. The decor was amazing. I ordered the Japanese teryaki bowl vegetarian style and it was amazing. I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice! And this place is vivid and just amazing. WAY better than panda express. I will definately come here again, and recomend it to everyone!!!\n",
      "Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.\n",
      "Service is fast and on time. Love the online ordering-very convenient! Food is always hot and delicious. However...NO FORKS FOR TAKE OUT? That is poor management. Either you didn't order in time or there was a problem with the order...either way, hustle your booty to Walmart and buy a couple boxes: Unacceptable!\n",
      "The food was fantastic! I highly recommend the lettuce wraps.\n",
      "Then we went to dinner at Pei Wei. Not bad for an Asian fusion place. Filled with senior citizens, but that's not all that surprising. I had the Mango Thai Shrimp, apparently, which was good. Right amount of spice in the dish. Not too heavy, either. Steve and Chris had their own plates as well, both of which looked appetizing. Not crazy about the moderate wait nor the fact that strangers came up to the table with unnecessary parenting advice for Steve and Chris.\n",
      "We use them to cater family get-togethers. Love the vegetarian dishes, especially the baked tofu- yum! The Mongolian beef is a favorite with family. When we dine in we always get the lettuce wrap.\n",
      "We went as a family of 6 and was treated very poorly by the manager at the place. The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite. Just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me. Maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant. I wont waste my time here.\n",
      "I love their food. I have gone there multiple times and still think it's great. I especially love their soda machine. The Mongolian Beef dish is my absolute favorite.\n",
      "We are winter residents and always look forward to eating here when we return. Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup. The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds, when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet. Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today.\n",
      "Very tasty Chinese food! The prices are reasonable and serving sizes are generous. I really enjoyed the Mongolian Beef! Dont forget to grab a fortune cookie from the bowl on your way out!\n",
      "All around great flavor and portions. Perfect for take-out always consistent the fam eats here about three times a month never had a bad meal.\n",
      "The vegetarian options are pretty good, especially if you like tofu. The restaurant was out of napkins the last time I was there and the staff was friendly. I would recommend the take-out option versus dining in though.\n",
      "Pretty good food a chain. You do get a lot of food for the price. However, every time I have ordered online there has been a mistake. Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.\n",
      "What can I say, I'm a sucker for Pei Wei. When we lived in California, I heard the place was shut down. Glad to move back and see it open. Take out rocks, call ahead. They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you. They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch. I think I eat there too much! The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine. Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke. Wish they had some filter system. Otherwise, I could eat here daily. Find me here at least once a week! :)\n",
      "Took the family there last week. Ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, Mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles. The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy. Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice. Same thing with the sweet and sour beef. Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts. They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top. Sent it back and they fixed it. They brought us spring rolls which we did not order. We said they were not ours we ordered wontons. They bring us the wontons a few minutes later. The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he \"let us keep the spring rolls\" and \"didn't charge is for all of our drinks\" as if he did us a favor. Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!! I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day..\n",
      "I love the food and the containers it comes in. We eat there sometimes and also carry out. My favorite is ginger beef broccoli! Thank you for the emails especially. I really appreciate it\n",
      "Pei Wei has become a favorite \"take out\" spot for both myself and my girl friend. We drive a little further than the local Taco Bell - KFC combination fast food stop, but to eat healthier it is certainly worth our time. Yesterday, after our Silver Crafting Class, we drove the 2.4 miles and not only enjoyed a relaxing healthy lunch, but then purchased \"take home\" orders so we would have our evening meal in the refrigerator waiting. (I brought my husband home an order of his favorite Kung Po Chicken with brown rice.) If you haven't give Pei Wei a try, stop in some time. I believe you'll enjoy it -- that is, IF, you enjoy Asian dishes.\n",
      "It's just above average. Portions are decent and cost was ok. Got in and out fast by phoning our order in. Good was ok, it didn't floor me but it didn't make me not want to there again.\n",
      "In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?\n",
      "Pei Wei is the fast food version of PF Changs. There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates \"Flows,\" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!\n",
      "I love the lettuce wraps here. They are simply the best. I order carry out often from here. I occasionally dine in. My problem with the dinning in is the seating. It is always difficult to find a seat. The place really needs to expand. If you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up. Other than the seating I like it. Large portions of rice and noodles. A little stingy on the meat.\n",
      "Just dirty ... Sometimes I wonder why we come back here. At the register the girl handed me a cup. There was particles of food on the inside. I handed it back and said \"It's dirty, I'll take a different one.\" She put the dirty cup back with the other 'clean' cups. I stopped and restated \"No. It's DIRTY, you probably shouldn't give it to someone else.\" (Shaking my head)\n",
      "Hot,vegan,carbo load You name it and they have it Pricing is reasonable and quality excellent No disappointments here Five stars for the food We try to stop by monthly\n",
      "I eat regularly (3-5 times a month) at Pei Wei, usually in Scottsdale or North Phoenix. My wife's doctor is across the street from this Pei Wei, so we have been stopping in when we go to her baby check ups. It is, without a doubt, the best Pei Wei I have eaten at. It is consistent, they don't get frustrated if you customize your order, and the cooks on always on point. Wish this location was closer!\n",
      "This Pei Wei location has such kind, welcoming staff. They are so accommodating and hospitable. 5 stars, hands down.\n",
      "Pei Wei is a fast, easy, cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's, you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also, compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery), it's really not all that busy. Of course, it's not authentic Asian food, but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway.\n",
      "The problem may be that I lived in the Bay Area for 30 years. There, bad restaurants expire in less that a year. Pei Wei wouldn't last very long. We had the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken. The beef was in a salty, sticky sweet brown sauce that rendered it almost inedible. The Chicken had little spice or sauce, although the pea pods were fresh. Think Panda Express. Food is not serve family style. Food is ordered at the register and brought (eventually) to your table.\n",
      "First time ever giving a review but felt it was necessary. I'm just gonna go all in and say it... Pei Wei sucks ass. It seems to be subjective, I know. But in comparison to legitimate Asian food, wheather that's credible Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., I'm not sure how anyone can make a compelling argument that Pei Wei is \"good\" food.. The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place. Spend a couple extra bucks and go eat some authentic Asian cuisine at a family owned restaurant that actually knows how to cook real food.. Not some corporate food chain bullshit.. Thank you for reading and bless your heart.\n",
      "The wait time for the food was way too long- 30 minutes for a bowl of spicy noodles with some veggies. I'm a guest from out of state but this is nothing better than my local Panda joint. They should probably let the customers cook the food cause we could do it faster. The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right?? The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!! I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad.\n",
      "I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price. Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful. This place is clean, the staff is wonderful and go out of their way to help you. They stay a step ahead of you and get what what you need. The food is perfect! I have eaten here many many times and it has always been fresh, hot, and delicious! I highly recommend this place, 100%!\n",
      "Service is a 4 . Very sloppy also the hot and sour soup aint that bad if u add enough chile paste and salt and soy sauce the gentleman named pop he is the manager great service from him and this other lady did not get her name unfortunetly I've changed my rating 2 times that's how impressed I am\n",
      "Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time. No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???\n",
      "We are from the Midwest and are visiting Phoenix on a vacation. We stopped in this place for some quick Asian food. What a great surprise! I had the Mongolian chicken and it was great. Very similar to PF Chang. You order at the counter and they bring the food. I wish we had one of these where I live.\n",
      "I usually go to pei wei regularly and am usually over all satisfied. However today did not go well . First I was unable to order online, when I went to pick up the food I brought a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so I paid out of pocket. The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for? BUYER BEWARE...\n",
      "Enjoyed the bright fun Mexican decor! The food was delicious and reasonably priced! And the margaritas were delicious!\n",
      "I've been here at least 5 times now and each time is better than the last. I Iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! Everything I've had on the menu has been great.\n",
      "Terrific service. The place was packed, but we were seated right away. Chips and salsa on the table as we were seated. Great food, big portions, fast service.\n",
      "Ate here for lunch on a Sunday. Arrived around 12:30, and there were a decent number of customers seated. Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews. This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to.\n",
      "Been dining here since it first opened. Wife is from tx so this is her taste of home. When tx folks come to visit they ask to go to Don's. It's very good tex-mex.\n",
      "If you have a hankering for Mexican, head on over to don tequilas. Fast service and delicious food with generous portions. We ordered the Guadalajara special tamale and the pollo adobe and they were both delicious.\n",
      "Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.\n",
      "I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately \"americanized\" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce.... So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... Just let the waiter know.. Hell guide you to a great choice!\n",
      "Inconsistent service, average food.....I've had better at Chipotle..... Won't be back.\n",
      "Always the same old bad Mexican food. At least this time I did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my Fajita Burrito. Why many people I know, including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me.\n",
      "Very good, reasonable priced . The Texas quesadilla with chicken, Steak, shrimp, onion, peppers and cheese was large and very good They have Dos Equis on draft!\n",
      "What a surprise! The most amazing Mexican food I have ever tasted and I am a foodie. My husband and I ordered the table side guac. Delicious! Texas margaritas. Delicious! Seafood burritos with fresh cilantro! I will be salivating for them soon! All of the food was so fresh! You must try this place. We will try the Green Road location next as it is closer to our home.\n",
      "Amazingly good Mexican food but they rip you off EVERY time. They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up. Its ALWAYS more. We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time. Its too bad they scam their customers like this because the food really is awesome. Write down everything you order and be prepared to question your bill.\n",
      "The service was ok, the salsa flavorful, and the food pretty good. They only serve pre mixed margaritas, which is no bueno. I ordered the burrito fajita and it was great, but the kids nachos were bland and rubbery.\n",
      "We came here for the first time to celebrate my birthday. We ate a ton of fresh chips in advance of the meal, the salsa was pretty mild. I had the Chori pollo, which is a burrito with chorizo and chicken with rice. Man, it was amazing. Hot and spicy with peppers, I took some of the huge portion home and ate it the next day. The service was seriously, amazingly fast for a group of 4, and they kept our drinks regularly filled.\n",
      "Yum!!! I love this place! Come almost every Friday. Try the Chicken Chili Verde, my first favorite dish. My new favorite, Burrito Chipotle!!!! So delicious! Don't forget the margaritas!! :)\n",
      "We've eaten here 2-3 times a month for the last few years. It's my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I've never had a meal I didn't like! The menu is so huge and full of options, even your pickiest eaters should be able to find something they can enjoy. I love how quickly the meals come out, which is especially nice when you're on your lunch hour. The portions are always great, and the staff treats us like family each time we stop in!\n",
      "We have just moved from Austin,TX to NE Ohio and are searching for our new favorite Mexican restaurant. We were greeted promptly and brought to our table. The chips were fresh and warm. The salsa was a little blander than we care for. Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening. I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautéed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla. It was average. My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito. Hubby said it was above average. The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro. We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest. Overall, we rated it as adequate to good.\n",
      "Maybe let's work on the chili rolenos. Do nice large poblemo peppers like el rancho and you got me as a frequent customer. A+ on the guacamole! Large portion. Nice!\n",
      "The food isn't bad, but every time I come here with friends they overcharge us. We end up getting charged at least a few dollars more than our menu items should be when we check out, and it's happened on several different occasions. Though the food may have been good and reasonably priced (on the menu, not on the bill), we will unfortunately never be going back. Very disappointing.\n",
      "First time I eat here I came with friends who told me the food was the most authentic Mexican food they ever had, well it was not for me since it's not really Mexican but Tex Mex really. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piña colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means.\n",
      "Amazing Mexican place!! Very tasty and reasonably priced. We ordered Molacajete, seafood chimi and carne asada burrito. The best!! Molacajete is a must try! This is something new I have never tried before. Service is quick! Cute authentic decor.\n",
      "Service is great. Food is texmex and very good. I wish they offered black beans, I'm from California where black beans are popular. Margaritas are great, I got a buzz from two. The place was busy. Mexican families were here and that's a plus.\n",
      "The first thing I noticed here was the decor, which I have to say I liked. Of course, yes, I enjoy lime green walls and bright pink color washes, but that's just me. We had three little ones with us, so you can imagine that we were a little less than organized, but our server took it all in stride, which we appreciated. He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out. As for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review. I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla. The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing. It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it. The chips and salsa were great, though. And hot. The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals. I'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else. Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.\n",
      "With everywhere else packed on a Friday night, we wondered in, not expecting much quite honestly. We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us. The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow. Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25. Definitely planning another visit.\n",
      "i don't understand all of the high marks for the this place. the chips were not good and the salsa wasn't good either.. the chips were bland, old and not seasoned at all, the salsa represented canned tomato taste, yuk, the chix enchilada was flavorless, while using white meat chicken it was not seasoned and very chewy, it had no flavor whatsoever and was definitely something \"not\" to order. the most off putting thing about the place is the filthiness of all the furniture and the fact that we had fruit flies buzzing our table thru out our meal. while el rodeo and el patron are nearby, and have far better food,i cant understand what the attraction is to this place, will not be back\n",
      "On a recent trip to Kirtland, OH. Decided to try even though the outside appearance was somewhat questionable. But nice simple decor inside. Friendly waitress who gave good tips from the menu. We both had the Tres Amigos. Nice chicken, steak, shrimp combo.\n",
      "If you blink. You will miss this little eatery, squished into the corner of a small strip mall in Mentor, Ohio. I went with a friend of mine from the area, who was treated like a rock star when he arrived (well, he IS a rock star), and that's indicative of the casual and familial vibe at this restaurant. I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious. Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant. Now that I know that this place exists, it gives me even more reason to travel to the northern tip of Ohio for good company and eats!\n",
      "Good food, great prices, large portions, fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for. We highly recommend you try it!\n",
      "This will probably be my last review of this location. I was at don tequila yesterday & the cashier was talking to me but I couldn't understand so I laughed it off. He told me I looked sexy today and said something else. I said thanks and laughed so that he wouldn't be offended. He came around the counter and walked up on me then hugged me so I assume he was asking for a hug. He then whispered in my ear that he just wanted to feel my breast on his chest. Seriously....I don't feel like I need to wear jeans and sweaters in the summer because he is a pervert. It was very disrespectful and unprofessional and I feel uncomfortable eating there anymore.\n",
      "Sometimes you need a little spice in your life. Don Tequilla delivers. The neon sign beckons you inside and once there, sit back and enjoy. The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice. I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce. Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!! The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom.\n",
      "i love this place! First impressions this place is a fun atmosphere filled with mexican clay rooftops and colorful furniture. You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks. They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to. The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates. The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in. Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth. The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover. It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close. I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied. for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!\n",
      "Authentic. Delicious chips and salsa follow you to the table on arrival - food arrives on plates too hot to touch. We lived in the South West for 9 years and ate at many Mexican places ONCE, before calling DonnyTs our favorite. We have been enjoying perfect food here for 6 plus years. Very little turn over in wait or kitchen staff... consistent quality food and service.\n",
      "Why hello service. Don't let the lime green walls scare you, this place is all business. Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros.\n",
      "Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito with eggs, chorizo and cheese. It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back.\n",
      "This is our go to Mexican restaurant. The staff is kind and courteous and Javier is an amazing gentleman. Always prompt , fresh and delicious. Their mango margaritas and dos Equis pair perfectly with our meals. Very family friendly and great atmosphere. Really a great place\n",
      "Food was AWESOME. The normal tacos are ... well ... normal and typical. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good fajitas. I ordered the burrito durango which was a 12 inch shell STUFFED with chicken, steak, and huge shrimp! I asked for it spicy... and it actually came with pretty good heat. The burrito was outstanding, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Overall, we'll probably be back.\n",
      "Food is always great especially Tableside Gauc but today service was really slow because of kitchen. Waiter couldn't have been nicer\n",
      "We had a really good meal here, service was quick and accurate. Food was definitely better than most Mexican places around. Margaritas were very good. Most of all, the place was very clean! Would definitely go again!\n",
      "Went on a saturday night on the first night of summer, and had a party of 12. We were sat almost immediately. Went there because they had catered a party of a friend of mine. Our server was professional, and bilingual. But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent. Americanized i suppose. They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue. They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste. I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans. All came out hot but a little watery. Dunno where that came from. But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it. Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor.\n",
      "Your basic traditional Mexican style restaurant, never at in only ordered out. Made me wait for a hand full of my orders when I came to pick it up..but super tasty. With a lot of hit and miss items in the menu.\n",
      "Very bland. Salsa is like tomato sauce. Enchilada sauce taste like canned marinara.. just awful.\n",
      "Been here a couple times and so far every time we've gone the foods been great, the service has always been friendly and the portions are amazing!\n",
      "Tacos al pastor--delish! Salsa and guacamole was very fresh! Refried beans were super good. Service was friendly and fast. Beer was cold and the bathroom was clean. What more can you ask for?\n",
      "So, I thought the food was average. But what makes this place is the cool interior and super attentive and friendly bartenders and servers. We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever. Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer. My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that. Very clean restaurant.\n",
      "We've been going here several times a month ever since they opened. Some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had at absolutely the LOWEST prices I have ever found for food this good. Waiters friendly and attentive. Nice decor. Nice new Bar.\n",
      "I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent. Meh as others would put it. Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between. The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out! My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.\n",
      "for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three. okay. lets break it down. the service. when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive. we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available. there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair. not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal. i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three. if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine. the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience. every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself. its not the problem of the customer. its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself. for lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup. we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip. not exorbitant and not cheap. though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home. in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not. but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti. its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is. that being said the sandwiches tasted great. (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of \"well then what the hell is he complaining about\"). the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were 4 dollars each. we had three kinds. one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil. another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon. i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients. i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it? i think so. again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so. all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty. so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.\n",
      "Love this place. I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list. We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! The service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French. I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!\n",
      "Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17. Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just). Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent. Also, the food prices All in all a great evening - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish. Definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu.\n",
      "Table 17 is a classic bistro with a very good menu, wine list and cocktail list. I've been many times for dinner as well as brunch. Food is always consistent, have never not liked anything I have ordered. Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu. Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good. Note: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins.\n",
      "I've been here for a few dinners and brunches, and it has been a pleasure every time. The service has always been very attentive and helpful. For one of the dinners, our group had trouble deciding on dishes so our server suggested that we pick a price point and let the chef put together a menu. It was a really fantastic experience!\n",
      "Ok, full disclosure: went here as a default because Ascari Enoteca was closed down due to a busted water pipe or something. Food was AMAZING! We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious. To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, \"Everything is awesome....\"\n",
      "We had an exceptional experience at Table 17. Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort.\n",
      "Found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a Sunday. There was one table available luckily. There wasn't a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! And very out of the ordinary. Service was good too. French toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. It's a delight for the senses, this place.\n",
      "By far my favourite restaurant in the east end. Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list. Great for any occasion!\n",
      "I booked the private room for a small wedding reception recently. We had 14 guests, the room was perfect. Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate. The dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating. We had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent. It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal. My favourite was the polenta bolognese. I could eat that for days.\n",
      "I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment. The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same. I found myself here ordering the much touted \"Hot Balls\" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the \"Diver Scallops\" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the \"Leg of Lamb\" and \"Wild Stripped Bass\" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor. Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience. I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.\n",
      "I had a nice time at Table 17. It was busy when we got there. We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot. I had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good. I had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked. We shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour. Table 17 had a great vibe to it. The food was good. The servers were attentive. I'd definitely go back.\n",
      "We had the scotch egg and the tomato based eggs. Everything was delish! While I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it's not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!) The potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared! The americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more. I had on of their $5 mimosas which is something that would keep me coming back weekly if I could ! The staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things) A perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two \"brunch hot spots\" in the area. Highly recommend this spot!\n",
      "my first time here. Very impressed. Food was very tasty. Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing. So fresh. It came with a side of vegetables and i got some steak fries with it as well. The service was pretty spot on and we were always asked if everything was o.k...which it was.\n",
      "Walked in on a cold saturday afternoon round 1330! waitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east. We started with mimosas while studying the brunch menu. Helen was helpful, knowledgeable and prompt. I ordered the seasonal scramble, which today was chorizo artisanal, and tarragon scrambled fluffyly together with country butter toast. Loved it. My girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good. We then asked for a cheese plate which was only available for dinner. Helen accommodated us with it anyway: *Paillot de chevre *Mapledale 5 year cheddar *Ciel de charlevoix *Monforte toscano pecorino *Clandestin Great little figs stuffed with walnuts dry crannies and almonds A good bottle of sancerre and \"Voila\" $118 for the both of us will come back, loved it!\n",
      "I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in. It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came. The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. An all around let down for a place that I had heard was good.\n",
      "Had an enjoyable meal at this Leslieville spot. Menu is light on vegetarian options but is otherwise diverse. The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint. My pal ate the steak and frites and licked the plate clean. My pomegranate cocktail was so sweet and satisfying that I had two.\n",
      "I've had the pleasure of dining at Table 17 on two occasions. One time we were a group of four and another time it was just me and my husband. The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?) I'd suggest the Bourbon sour. Yummy.\n",
      "I'm going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl's first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn't really taint my evening because the food was excellent. Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's! I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it's at, at a place like this.\n",
      "I love this place. It's definitely a little pricey, so it's more of a special occasion place. Love the décor. They have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread. Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate. Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it's place. The \"hot balls\" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them. I can't say I've ever had anything like them before. There are 3 different types: Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto. A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious. I went with the fish (trout) for my entrée. It was very good. Nothing special or unique to report. I was very impressed with the service here. I've recommended this restaurant to others, and they've loved it too.\n",
      "Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17. Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests. The dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. Our server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. Our table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else. That being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch. Considering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won't visit again.\n",
      "Booked through OpenTable a few days before, for 8pm. Zipped right in to our table. Had the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon). Had the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates. My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert. The cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car! My friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert. All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone. The service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable. Too bad others had issues, thought our guy was fine. Reservations are definitely recommended, was quite busy.\n",
      "I came here for weekend brunch. We arrived around 11:30 and there was no wait, lots of free tables. It was packed by 12 or 12:30 though. The place is cozy and inviting. It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet. The brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. The whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive. Street parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour. I checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a \"14 oz. (!!) Heritage Beef Ribeye with hen of the woods mushrooms and mint & orange gremolata\" for my next visit.\n",
      "I'll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest. However, the food was right on the money. Good flavor; prompt service. If you have the money, go!\n",
      "We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish ! Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table. And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome. We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.\n",
      "I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!). The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing. The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem \"fried\" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the \"Sloppy\" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough). My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup.\n",
      "Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts! We had... Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished. Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously. Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them! Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.\n",
      "One of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is consistent and the service impeccable. The steak frites are the best in the city. Scallops, duck confit and short ribs are also regular favourites.\n",
      "Literally my FAVORITE new restaurant in the northern hemisphere. I've all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it. Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience. Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular. The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors Kudos. We'll be back soon!\n",
      "The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! -CL PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)\n",
      "On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well. Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine. Right off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed understaffed. Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant. And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his \"little neglected table.\" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned. Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the \"shared food\" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a \"sugo\" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share. Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained \"sauce & balls\" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were \"al dente\" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese. Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's \"Anna 6\" white was very dry and very refreshing. In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was \"out\" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste. Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip. This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks. I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.\n",
      "Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 9.5/10 Overall experience: 9/10 A lovely experience overall. Went and ordered: - foie gras appetizer - polenta (main #1) - pasta special All the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot. The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount. THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service.\n",
      "We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here's your table. Our server was fantastic! I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients. We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both! My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it. It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding. All in all an excellent dining experience.\n",
      "This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.\n",
      "We were back here this evening. Delish! I ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it's own. My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour. My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish. I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on! It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine. We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!\n",
      "Love this restaurant!!! Awesome brunch, $10 for anything on the menu. My hubby doesn't get super full off of the stuff, but I'm good with the amount. Awesome decor too!!\n",
      "We went here for Mother's Day brunch. I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices. We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.\n",
      "We had a great time. Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it). The polenta had their \"reindeer sauce\" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious. Oysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible. $400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return. Oh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can't see anything wrong with this place.\n",
      "I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hôte we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous. As a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles. A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more.\n",
      "I wish I could share Avitania B.'s Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down. I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try. At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It's 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their \"first-world problems\": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure. The food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18. I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive. At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter's attention.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that they aren't over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I'm a late eater.) The appetizers are where it is at here!\n",
      "Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. I had the Sloppy Giuseppe - Two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of Bolognese sauce. Awesome. I'll definitely be back for that alone.\n",
      "Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes. Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No. I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated. Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax. The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as \"Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue\"?! Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.\n",
      "Brunchy time and we have a winner. To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch. I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush. It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch. For my meal, I had the french toast. It was good - light and perfectly cooked. The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream. There was an assortment of berries as well. Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!\n",
      "What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat. First off the \"hot balls\" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing. For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito). Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience.\n",
      "Was here for my first time just last week. Loved it. It was highlighted by the Soft Shell Crab and the Hunter's Mash. Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender. I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit. Also, they are very quick to respond to any questions you have via Twitter.\n",
      "Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation. Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault. Food: The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly. To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum. My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert. Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault. Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier. Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.\n",
      "If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that's the place to go on a Saturday morning. Make sure to come early as they don't accept reservations for less than groups of 6!!\n",
      "We really enjoyed this place. Food and service was excellent. Table 17 has different and unique things to try! I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!!\n",
      "I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn't ruin the experience.\n",
      "Great decor, great food, great drinks. Food was really good, not a huge selection on the menu, but it was also a set menu for the night, so can't comment on the normal menu. Food was very tasty, and there was a very different selection of draft beer, all ones I hadn't heard of, but the one I tried was very good. Will definitly be going back!\n",
      "\"Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,\" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013. That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high. I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different. It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination. The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant. While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down. A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated. I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow. Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it. Oysters come with a trio of condiments; two mignonettes and the standard horseradish. We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless. The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored. I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer. For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms. Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it? To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish). The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point. The radish fennel & grapefruit \"salad\" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph. Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish. The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles. Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale. It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables. As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing. A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top. The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else. The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you. While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance. Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300. Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17.\n",
      "Stopped in right after lunch shift for a couple drinks. Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink. That said, they were definitely on the pricey end.\n",
      "Great service, the food and drinks were a miss. Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay. POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed. Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere. Overall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine.\n",
      "I went here with a group of 4 late on a friday night at around 9:30 pm. We had a bottle of wine, foie gras, risotto, the ribeye, and a few other sides. Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality.\n",
      "PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great. The menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise I was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good.\n",
      "Had a travelzoo voucher for this place. Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks \"might as well get your money's worth, right?\". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my \"age\" and our voucher. After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. I honestly felt like we were given the \"pretty woman\" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway! All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light. I wouldn't chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn't be worth it.\n",
      "Rarely do I ever venture east of Yonge. It terrifies me. But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be). Once we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who's making my meal!). I had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). The server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed. Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks.\n",
      "Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it's been better and better. Last time I had the daily quiche and it was good. Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it. I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service. Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness. Maybe I've just lucked out.\n",
      "I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning. Serving staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone's plates were well-presented. The decor had rustic charm and we didn't feel crammed in like many small brunch spots. Our coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch? I would definitely return to Table 17.\n",
      "The only downside about this place is that somehow I've only just discovered it! My friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event. My friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10. During our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it. I would absolutely return and recommend.\n",
      "Dropped in on a Sunday for Table 17's BYOW Table D'Hote. There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging. Table D'hote gives you a selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it. Neither of our dishes disappointed. What we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price. Service was efficient if not overly friendly. I remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn't think twice about many repeat visits.\n",
      "The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless. I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto.\n",
      "Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service. The much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about. For entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod. Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour). $250 for 4 people with some booze.\n",
      "Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours. The service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh! I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren't blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation!\n",
      "The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality. It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch. The good: - The food is good and the ingredients are top quality - Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees - Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu - They do potato rosti right - Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon - Good service both times I've been - Proximity to my house - they use opentable The bad: - It is too expensive. The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it. Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here. - It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.) No funny stories. Would I go here again? Maybe. I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights. Man, this place is just too expensive. I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here.\n",
      "This was a nice little surprise. My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited. The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl. There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy. There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch. The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be. I will return.\n",
      "I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!). Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it. I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go. The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day. I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!\n",
      "Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. My girlfriend and I stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise. The people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. Speaking of food, it's the best part. I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won't come away hungry. Bravo guys. Bra-vo.\n",
      "We're regulars here. Delicious brunchs! Delicious dinners! Service is quick and helpful. Is a dressed-up/relaxed place. Bonjour Brioche have a line, come here!!!\n",
      "I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste). What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. And so it goes... I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. The service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. The food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.\n",
      "Appetizer: Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint My friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. Entrée: Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. Dessert: Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!\n",
      "I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review. Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering. I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco.\n",
      "Taste good but bad value. Portions are way too small. We both had a app main and desert and still very hungry.\n",
      "Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service. Bottom line: impossible to go wrong with a visit.\n",
      "Went to a Brunch party and it was so cool and awesome, the food and service where amazing and the stuff where so funny!! Know I here is shut down and closed that's sad :(\n",
      "What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner. Table 17 is intimate, split into two rooms. The service is very personal but not invasive. Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed. The menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout. I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return.\n",
      "I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it's small. As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance. The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile. The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me. We might even go back before we leave Toronto to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of.\n",
      "Disappointing experience. The restaurant was packed and my friend and I were crammed into a small table where we were basically touching elbows with the tables beside us. The food wasn't anything special which surprised me - I had been intrigued to try this place for a while but I won't be going back.\n",
      "Went for Sunday brunch. Nacoise salad for me, scramble of the day for my friend. Waiter had an attitude. Food was good / acceptable. Decor was lovely (especially the bathroom!), however I wouldn't go back again.\n",
      "Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date. The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic. The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with. We were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish. This is a must at Table 17! The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a \"ragu\" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour. It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3. The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air. As a note, Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer\n",
      "Meh. Service was bad and food wasn't much better. The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night. To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed.\n",
      "I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet. I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items. The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean. Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious. Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!! P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.\n",
      "Had dinner with some colleagues on Monday Dec 30, 13. The food was ah-ma-zing!! In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake! You can't go wrong at table17.\n",
      "I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch! My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.\n",
      "Came for brunch with my wife and two young boys on a Saturday. We had the scotch eggs and Giuseppe eggs. They have $4 kids meals too. We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We'll be coming back for sure!\n",
      "What a great little restaurant in Leslieville. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service. Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city. Call me a fan. I will definitely go back!\n",
      "For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating. I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind. Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation. I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!). But, they did not. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly. The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees. Everyone was happy with their meal. The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy. The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles. The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive. The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).\n",
      "I have only been for brunch but was impressed. Very friendly staff. Somewhat traditional French brunch menu, and well executed items. They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great. The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it.\n",
      "All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed. Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.\n",
      "We've been here for brunch a couple of times. Had the rosti both times, as well as the neapolitan eggs and the weekly scramble. Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly. Also entirely reasonably priced. Recommended.\n",
      "I've been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding! With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner. The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!) For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness. It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me. On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty. For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice. I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint.\n",
      "I can never resist hot ballZ (sexy menu item here at Table 17). Conveniently located near Jilly's (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place. I tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate. The hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it's own dipping sauce. I think these are a \"must have\" if you come here. The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off . It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot. The wine list is extensive but the price point was a bit over the top - no bottles under $60 and the 1/2 liters started at $45. Apparently on Sunday/Monday you can bring-your-own-wine, but not sure what the corkage fee was.\n",
      "I have been hear a couple of times and overall have enjoyed the food. I had the trout as my main and it was very fresh and perfectly cooked. It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying. Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe.\n",
      "Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up. My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints. Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal. Service is excellent. Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work.\n",
      "Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. Nice wine list. Will return soon. Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times.\n",
      "The things that I liked: Interior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to. Server was a very lively & attentive British man. Some qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough. The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold. Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent. For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range.\n",
      "My experience with Table 17 were excellent. I do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe. We were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening. We shared: Lamb Polenta ($14) Duck Confit ($26) Vanilla poached rhubarb ($8) Everything was well prepared with great care. I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover! The restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening. I guess a lot of people were taking advantage of their prix menu $35 during Sunday and Monday with BYOW. Will definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood. PS: Thanks Amy L for the invitation\n",
      "wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends! bonus! i didn't know there were coupons and deals at this place as I was reading the reviews but I would still pay full price to come here, gotta try dinner someday. good vibe here, good neighbourhood, good food! no line-ups for brunch either\n",
      "I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that's how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince.\n",
      "My girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil. Glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!\n",
      "I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard. Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying. Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious. It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can't wait to go back.\n",
      "After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to \"walk-in\" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be. We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm, and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor. The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!). A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!\n",
      "My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service. Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud. The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light. My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed. The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests. Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)\n",
      "I've been a resident here for almost 3 years, and I've been pleased with my time here. First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance. Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South. My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light. We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it. I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's. There are 3 pools on site too. As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job. Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it! Good service, helpful attitude. Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them. Annoying. It's also noisy on the occassional Friday or Saturday night - but never bad enough that I couldn't sleep.\n",
      "They are changing their complex name to Mosaic, so be forewarned the issues will exist there, too. I am sick of this. The water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. The first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now I wake up and there is no water and I can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work! Also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. They also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and I come home from work after it is dark. Since I come home after dark, I notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently. The new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. You can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late.\n",
      "I was going to post this for the leasing office, but it seems more appropriate to put it under the community as a whole... After searching for a new place for a couple of months, I settled on Acacia Creek. I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough. One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day. So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease. Right before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount. I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago. We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online. It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused. I pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online. Her defense was that \"[their] prices change every day,\" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line. I tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again. I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong! She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on. I have no idea why she couldn't say something like, \"Our website isn't accurate - you should call,\" or, \"Let me see what I can do\" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates. If this is how they treat prospective tenants who WANT to live there and pay their rent, I can't imagine how they treat their residents.\n",
      "I don't expect much out of an apartment complex... lets be honest... we all had negative experiences that just make us hope for the essentials and that the staff will somewhat acknowledge your existence past routine notes taped to your door. That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing! Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101. The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun). But the walls are 2 toned with a nice beige accent wall in every room, including the bathrooms. The master has a large walk in closet and lots of storage. There is also a full sized washer and dryer. The appliances are older Hotpoints, but they work well so no real complaints outside of aesthetic purposes. Overall, if you are looking for an affordable option in the heart of Scottsdale, or you are new to the area and want somewhere safe and comfortable... DEFINITELY consider Acacia Creek.. you will not be disappointed!!\n",
      "A beautiful set of high end shops. I can't really afford to shop here on a regular basis when i'm in Vegas, but I am a sucker for two of them. The Rare Bookstore and Andrew's Ties usually get a visit out of me. The fountain is usually the center of attention for tourists taking pictures of their sweeties or families. If you sit near the water, don't move back too far or you'll get water down your pants!\n",
      "Definitely high end, high dollar stores! More like a museum than anything else. But it's so beautiful to walk around and do a little window shopping! Stop by Christian Louboutin and admire the red bottoms. Right across the way they have a little wine shop/lounge area to take a load off and enjoy a flight of white or reds or both! I very much enjoyed cruising around the shops.\n",
      "Love walking through here. Pretty views and displays. And of course, high end stores. Good restaurants can be found in here too.\n",
      "This was the highlight of my stay in Vegas! I love shopping at high end places, for some reason it makes me really happy spending loads of money. The mall itself is kind of small, but it is really pretty inside. Some shops here include Fendi, Barney's New York, Cartier, Ralph Lauren (includes Black Label) and Michael Kors.. Among others! All the stores are really nice with marble floors and such! This is the best place to go besides Rodeo Drive and 5th Avenue in New York if you're looking for an upscale shopping experience!\n",
      "Had a number of high end shops in a really nice setting but the place was relatively dead overall on a Saturday night. Most stores barely had 1 customer in them. The stores didn't do anything for me. Bottom line: Nice but I much prefer walking around the shops of Caesar's and Venetian.\n",
      "This is one of those great Las Vegas places for window shopping and people watching. I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops. Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything. What an interesting shop. I also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to. Those are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo. I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors.\n",
      "Lots of great high end stores and a couple staples like Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret. Lots of options for dining and a fun view of the \"Venice\" canals. The reason why my rating is so low is based upon the number of irritating merchants trying to hawk their wares/goods. Don't accept any samples from the brick/mortar stores either because as you can imagine they are pretty viscous. The Tea store (?) store the salesman was so rude when I said I was not interested in trying their products. I must have been approached by five or six different annoying salespeople as I'm trying to enjoy a leisurely stroll and shopping. I must say my favorite place to shop is NorthPark Center in Dallas...no annoying kiosks or \"hawkers.\"\n",
      "It wouldnt matter if I had all the riches in the world its just not my style all the uppity, high-end clothing & jewelry, to me its just not impressive. Yeah it sure is expensive but Not my cup of tea.\n",
      "If you had all the money in the world, this is shopping heaven. I was drooling all over. Christian Loubitin boutique? Barney's New York? Chloé, Diane Von Furstenburg and Jimmy Choo all situated in one place! (They don't have a Chanel boutique but you will find one next door at the Wynn). Basically, at The Palazzo, many of the stores have special collections you can't find anywhere else which is truly something ... If you go in December, you will find some awesome deals. The shoes at Barneys were half off, and many of the stores had seasonal pieces at 40% off. If you are looking for high end fashion items, this is the place to go. I'll def revisit when I come here, even for the sake of window shopping =)\n",
      "Definitely an upscale shopping center. The shops/boutiques are definitely for the rich. =) Great shopping experience.\n",
      "Because it's on the Strip, we don't get down to The Shoppes to often....however, when we make the trip, we're always happy that we did. There is a nice selection of upscale shops.....Fendi, Billionaire, Burberry, Coach...and many more. Those are a few of the shoppes The Better Half (TBH) and I like to browse. While we're here, we always make sure to stop by the Double Helix Wine Bar to enjoy a glass of Wine while we're shopping. Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, it's away from the action of the Casino. There's a good selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor as well. Will I return? You can count on it.\n",
      "A large collection of very upscale, world class stores. Although connected to the Venetian Canal, these two areas are worlds apart. The fountain area is very impressive, and very relaxing. I did notice that The Shoppes at Palazzo are very quiet and enjoyable, as there are virtually no children around. Very nice to grab a drink, walk through and enjoy the A/C, and do some fine window shopping. There are a few restaurants scattered throughout, but the majority of the area is populated with upper class stores. My girlfriend and I spent about an hour or so, walking and window shopping. She refused to go into any stores due to the price factor, however couldn't resist walking into the Jimmy Choo shoe store. Overall, an enjoyable experience. If you're like me and spent almost every bit of your savings to travel to Vegas, be prepared for a fun afternoon of looking at things you probably can't afford.\n",
      "I love the shops....perfect for window shopping, because most of the time I can't afford anything. Its usually never crowded, well whenever I've been there. Once you walk into one of the stores you get greeted by wonderful sales people. They make you feel so welcome. Walk into one of the stores, look around and sip on champagne. I utterly love that.\n",
      "High end stores; very nice area to walk around if you want to window shop or get out of the Vegas heat.\n",
      "The Shoppes at the Palazzo is one of the finest collections of luxury brands you will find one the strip. The mix what you need and what you want is dangerous because you can spend a lot of time and money over there and that's exactly what they are going for. Nestled above the Palazzo Casino floor it feels much more welcoming than the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian although you can't discount the difference in atmosphere being a good change of pace. The Shoppes at the Palazzo is more of your \"traditional\" shopping setting. This is a great place to go for shopping, dinning and just strolling around. If you haven't stopped by I would make it a point to go.\n",
      "This mall is a lot smaller than the ones that I walked through in Vegas, especially since they don't have a huge number of stores for you to look at. While the interiors and decorations of the mall looked really nice, the stores that they had were super pricey. Well, if you want to take a nice little walk in a shopping area, then this place is okay to do so.\n",
      "Of note, the Shoppes have been rolled into The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian/Palazzo under General Growth Properties. I imagine most of us will continue to consider these shoppes a separate entity for history's sake. This swanky mall within The Palazzo and now connected to the Grand Canal Shoppes houses restaurants and a wine bar as well as a variety of retail shops. Most of them are of a pricey, upscale nature, yes. Some aren't, such as Victoria's Secret, Tommy Bahama and Sephora. Double Helix is a cute little kiosk type wine bar located in the center of the shopping area. I've been to some of the restaurants a number of times, such as Grimaldi's and sushisamba, which is a standout. The shoppes have 3 levels, which proved to be wishful thinking even 9 years after the place opened! The atmosphere is kind of relaxing when it's not busy, and window shopping is usually cheaper than gambling!\n",
      "Really nice shopping mall. Beautiful with some really nice high end stores. Some of its shortcomings are it's small compared to other malls or even casino shopping malls, it doesn't blow you away like the Venetian Grand Canal Shops or Caesar's Forum Shoppes. Although it's attached to the Grand Canal shops. Nonetheless, because I never miss the Grand Canal Shops, I make the short walk to this place. When you win the Megabucks, you can afford to shop here.\n",
      "I'm a little on the meh side for the Shoppes at the Palazzo because it's not a very inviting environment for shopping. It is true that some of the very high end, very up-scale stores reside here and without a lot of money its hard for you to enjoy this place. But wait! The Forum Shops have JUST as many or similar types of designer stores ... why is it more fun? Well in the end, I attribute it to the fact that the Forum Shops have some \"regular stores\" as to draw a crowd and shows which retain the crowd. You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care). I feel like a great shopping experience and the whole point of shopping in a store is for the interaction, direct or indirect, that you have with everyone else. When I walk into the Palazzo, it's so empty it makes me want to be somewhere else with more people despite the awesome designer stores. This is not to say I will boycott the Shoppes, but it's definitely not my popular choice.\n",
      "Some great shops, but CRAZY hard to get your bearings, find the store you're looking for, or keep track of which \"aisles\" you've \"done\" and what's left to shop... for a sport shopper like me, that's incredibly annoying - and tends to keep me away. Given almost all of these stores can be found in at least one other shopping center in Vegas...\n",
      "Few unique, independent stores line the corridors of The Shoppes at The Palazzo, making this shopping center, well, just a shopping center, rather than a destination. While it is well kept, it is perennial ghost town, which allows for more personal service in many of the shops.\n",
      "Three words for you...High End Expensive. I can't give the Shoppes at the Palazzo any less than 5 stars because they market, advertise, and sell MONEY. That's their main goal. Put a bunch of high end stores together and make money. Since they accomplish their goal, you can't fault them for it. When it comes to expensive goodies, might as well set it up correctly and at one of the more classier casinos like the Palazzo. All the stores are maintained, clean, and have some of the best service ever, like ever. I've only been here a half dozen times and never bought anything due to my wine taste/beer budget. But I can tell you one thing, you're never stereotyped here, you're never treated like you don't belong, and you're never more than a minute in a store without great service. My issue...I just can't justify some of the expenses. If I ever hit the CA Lottery (2, 23, 45, 55, 8, Mega 13) then you may finally find me here not window shopping, but actually getting something. The Shoppes at the Palazzo: http://www.theshoppesatthepalazzo.com/directory\n",
      "Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. My friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, \"That one is $1400.\" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says \"Okay,\" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun! Nothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? For the hard-working middle class schmo and \"normal\" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip.\n",
      "Smashed burgers done properly in the heart of Weston village. Very happy that we have a spot like this now in the area. All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can't forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right. Definitely worth trying this place .\n",
      "The burgers here are the best burgers I have ever had, to top it off the service is even better. I was in the car waiting and the cook brought us the food when he didn't have to. Overall I will be coming here again!\n",
      "Great fresh burgers seared on a flat-top, and excellent fresh-cut fries and poutines, served up by an owner who cares. Freshly-ground daily, a 4oz. scoop of AAA beef is dropped on the flat top then smashed flat and seared until it's nicely crusted, then served on a sesame seed bun. The beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour. Their poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy. *Don't forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special. In a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones. Definitely check it out and help keep this place alive, we need to keep joints like this around and successful.\n",
      "Finally checked out this place yesterday after hearing great reviews about it... and it did not disappoint! My husband had the Z burger, I had the Heat burger and we shared the chef's poutine. Everything was amazing!!! Patty was very fresh and cooked to perfection and the toppings just topped it all off! The owner and his father were both so fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying everything! The place is very clean and lots of room for seating. The mama in me also noticed a high chair which is very convenient for families with babies/toddlers :) Definitely check this place out! Nice to see some good spots being put in Weston... will definitely be back soon!!!\n",
      "Excellent and friendly service and even better burgers! Tried the Z-burger and it well surpassed my expectations. Highly recommend Zeal Burger.\n",
      "Really good burger and fries. Always fresh, you can tsste the quality of the ingredients. Reasonably priced for what you get. Will be a regular customer.\n",
      "Love this place! Got their Signature burger, The Z Burger but the mini one! Their Z sauce is like a Big Mac sauce but way better!! I wish I lived right next to this place. Can't wait to try the Dunamis burger next!\n",
      "Had a Z burger with a fried egg and guac, one of the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The smell of those burgers on the flat top would make a vegetarian reconsider their dietary choices. I'm ecstatic that they opened a legit burger joint in the Weston and Lawrence area. I love the area, grew up there, so any new business, especially one of Zeal Burger's quality, is a welcome addition to the 'hood. Thumbs way up guys keep it up! You deserve every star. Believe the hype.\n",
      "Just had the zburger and poutine, if you want want a real filling homemade touch than this is the place. I definitely have a new hamburger stop, maybe I can can get a job there just to eat the food!!? Cheers!\n",
      "This was an amazing experience. The server/cook is such a friendly and caring host. He consistently makes sure that his customers are enjoying the food. He also makes sure the food is nice a presentable and treats every order and burger with perfection. I've tried The Heat and it's a pretty solid burger. It's a nice mix of ingredients. The fries were also pretty good. The area is spacious, clean and well maintained. I've never met someone who is so dedicated to perfection when it comes to serving food. I will most definitely be returning.\n",
      "The dude here is the nicest guy. Knew everything about the food and made us feel welcome. Burgers were amazing and worth the extra money. Skip Harvey's for this.\n",
      "Tastiest burger I've ever had! I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed:)\n",
      "Honestly the best burger joint I've ever been too, hands down! I came here a couple months ago for the first time. I ordered the Sorry Eh burger and told them I prefer no egg and they were more then glad to leave it out. The feta poutine was amazing as was the Nutella milkshake! Very friendly owner and the other guy was as well! Keep up the good work and wish you all the best in the future!\n",
      "This is by far one of the best burgers in the city. I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now. Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese. OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection. That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good. Might even go back tomorrow for another!!! Very clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover. PS Ate it too fast to take any pics to post.\n",
      "I read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Absolutely the best hamburger I've had in a long long time. Love the fries and the feta, the beef is grilled with a nice crust. Very friendly guy behind the counter, he walked us through the menu and made some recommendations. I am so happy that this place is so close to home.\n",
      "Just had my first ever Zeal burger - I never did a review before but I felt like I had too here! From the second I walked in with my guests, we were greeted with a great friendly smile!!! The burgers were cooked in front of us and looked soooooo good!!!! The fries are cooked to perfection and the burger is definitely memorable!!!! 100% recommendation!!!!!\n",
      "This had to be one of the best burgers I've eaten in a long time! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to people.\n",
      "First time here since the Sang's Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!\n",
      "Burger patty is ground from AAA meat and made daily you can tell from the taste that it is fresh. Fries are not greasy. Burger was done right not overly seasoned or drowning in toppings. I can tell the cook/owner loves what he's doing as you can see and taste it in the food. Customer service was top notch, place is very clean. I live in Markham and will drive to this place again probably next weekend!!\n",
      "Wonderful service with a smile. The owner does everything himself (two thumbs up). One of the best best burgers in the city for sure. I wish they were open later though, just a thought.\n",
      "Excellent - so happy I discovered Zeal Burgers. Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!). Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy. The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don't live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it.\n",
      "Fantastic burger! Definitely on par with five guys and I would say it's even better. The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I've ever been to, a must try! Also worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn't get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection.\n",
      "So I was randomly in the area, I had some time to kill waiting for someone so Zeal Burgers was in area, claiming they were great gourment burger and after having the Z Burger I cant say I disagree The Z burger was a double cheese burger, two fresh grilled 4 oz patties, topped with their onion \"stringer\" Which is their take on mix between fried onion and onion rings, so it still is deep fried but not as large as onion rings, which is tasty add with their z sauce it was an amazing burger\n",
      "Ordered the \"Sorry, Eh\" burger with fries and it was a really solid burger. It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable. Although a bit pricy ($10-15 usd) I would highly recommend this place.\n",
      "Loved these burgers! Fresh ingredients, flavours mesh perfectly for a mouthwatering experience. My kids loved the fries and their cheeseburger. My husband devoured the spicy burger even though he \"wasn't hungry\" and I loved my feta. We will go back often. The owner is a great guy, made us feel really welcome as we had just moved to the city.\n",
      "Good food, good people, good prices. About 14$ for double patty and a couple extras and fries The parking is a bit tricky if you don't wanna pay since the location is located on a main street\n",
      "My go to place to study! They play great music at a volume where you can still hear yourself think. It's almost never crowded, and the people that come there generally are reading or studying. They have an amazing tea collection, with equally good food and even grilled cheese sandwiches (with the option to add tomato :) ) One of the walls has some cute benches that are padded, making it a perfect place to wrap your hands around your warm cup of tea and read a book. I agree with Rachel C, I wish they had high tea, that would make it perfect! The only drawback is that it's small, and there aren't a lot of places to sit. If you are the mood to try a variety of tea, or just need a place to study/relax this is it!\n",
      "This place is ridiculously cute, colorful, and cozy, with a huge selection of loose leaf teas. They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup. They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is. The staff here has been friendly every time I've been. They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask! Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day. I tried it, and it was AMAZING! My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well. They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery. Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials. One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup. I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through. It's never been a major problem, though. You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing. Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back. This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!\n",
      "You can purchase from a huge variety of loose leaf teas. It's one of the few places I know that really pays attention to brew times and water temperature. The smoothies are fresh and taste very natural. If you order in, they'll give you your drink in a cup that looks smaller than if you order to-go. They have nice metal counters with lots of plug in places for your laptop. The benches aren't terribly comfortable, but the couches are. Plus, the people behind the counter are great!\n",
      "I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so. When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price. While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free. We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant. Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well. My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table. Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time! We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won. Yay! While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!\n",
      "Came on a weekday afternoon to study and it was a good environment to do so. I got salmon sushi for a great price, and the pots of tea with free refills are a great deal too. The employees are friendly and attentive. This place seemed like a nice casual place to spend a few hours studying, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.\n",
      "Amazing people Loveeee the owners. Best sushi in town best service and nothing beats their prices Good for bubble tea lovers\n",
      "This place hasn't changed a bit. Still awesome tea, great service and friendly faces. Although, the owners have changed, Te Cafe remains the same. So good to be back and sipping on my favorite iced lavender lemonade.\n",
      "Mulled Apple Cider Tea. Deliciousness in a hot steaming cup. Lots of space to lounge in. Friendly service.\n",
      "First visit here the other evening and it turned out to be the perfect place to sit and relax after a long busy day at work. I didn't even look over the tea selections because this café had me the minute I saw the featured drink listed on their outdoor sidewalk sign. I thoroughly enjoyed sipping my hot cider tea drink on the cozy corner seat near the window while reading and watching the world pass by. Truly a good place to unwind and be refreshed.\n",
      "LOVED THIS PLACE. It's like a coffee shop (/it is a coffee shop ha), but also has sushi. Good vibe and fairly quiet, which I always appreciate. There were about 5 other people working in here when my friend and I stopped in for lunch - and it's sad that this is rare - but everyone respected the fact that everyone else was working and stayed reasonably quiet. The sushi rolls were good and priced well for sushi. They were a good size too, which meant I ate just the right amount of food for lunch by ordering one roll with a seaweed salad. The best part for me was by far the service. Very friendly throughout my whole experience. As my friend and I were leaving, the people behind the counter even asked us if needed anything else. We said we were all good and they sent us off with a \"have a good day\" and a smile.\n",
      "This place doesn't even need anymore 5 star reviews. But it's just so damn good that I had to. The employees and owner(s?) are soo nice and recommended some pretty good teas! They also have a convenient water boiler where you can refill your own pot. Their sushi is spot on. Honestly, better than some sushi places around the area. The ambience is really nice, although wish their tables were a tad bit bigger. Still, a great place to study!\n",
      "Te Cafe has an extensive selection of teas including dozens of green and black teas as well as a few other variations; you can also order coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries. In terms of ambiance, it is one of the coziest establishments that I have been in making it an ideal place to read, study, or complete some work. It's also a nice venue to meet up with a friend for a pot of tea and some quiet conversation. There are also some board games (including Chess, Backgammon, and Dominoes among several others)\n",
      "I came here with a friend and her young child for my first visit. What a nice and friendly place! The staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend. I ended up getting a white tea which was nice. The cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench). I believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs. In addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children! My friend's child ahd the time of his life. I'll definitely be going back!\n",
      "Went here with my girlfriend and really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere. I'm not that into tea, but I had a couple cups from the pot my gf ordered and enjoyed it. We ordered 2 biscotti, a medium coffee and a pot of tea (which comes with a free refill) and it cost just over $7. The Barista was really nice and helpful.\n",
      "This is a cute little shop that you might miss if you're not paying attention. The person behind the counter was very helpful and the tea I ended up getting was very delicius. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, it's worth stopping in.\n",
      "Good tea, comfy chairs. I hear the food is also good, but have not tried it. Nice quiet place to relax.\n",
      "With wireless internet and a relaxing ambience, this was a place I was looking for during my two years in grad school. Coffeehouses in Pittsburgh often were too loud and rickety uncomfortable chairs. The owners are often attentive and bring a certain unique warmth to the place. Sure, a large part of the cafe is devoted to them. I loved coming here for an after-dinner conversation with a friend or for studying. Normally I would order a pot of darjeeling or a green tea. Great selection of teas. Very attentive service. They give you a timer to help you remember how long to steep the tea. The cups are all selected for the particular type of tea being served. When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed. Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat. Still, when I visit Pittsburgh, I will return to this place.\n",
      "I'm writing from Te Cafe right now. I love this place and always made an effort to come here when I was visiting Pittsburgh from other locales. It's sad that I don't come out here more often, now that I live here again... Anyway, they have a fantastic beverage selection (not just tea), high-quality loose-leaf teas you can buy by the ounce, comfortable enough seating, free wifi, and friendly staff. The music's a toss-up; right now, it's some pretty good oldish rock, but apparently there is \"wispy Lillith fair crap,\" sometimes? On the bright side, if you show up on a bad day, it is definitely quiet enough to allow you to just listen to your own on headphones. And the clientele is pretty varied, which I also rather like.\n",
      "Stopped by Te when I was in Pittsburgh and loved it. Quaint little place in Squirrel Hill with a fantastic selection of loose teas. The staff knows their teas and is friendly/helpful. And the atmosphere is comfortable and neighborly. If you're new to tea, this is a great place to get started and learn more. And if you're a tea veteran, you'll be happy with the variety. Cream Earl Grey is delicious, as well as peppermint rose.\n",
      "Te Cafe is going to be one of my favorite places in Squirrel Hill. I feel it. So here is the quick summary: - Loose leaf teas served by the cup or pot at reasonable prices! Cups of tea were around $2, and I got a pot of peaches and cream tea for $4.01 with tax. The Cream Earl Grey is amazing as well! There is also free hot water so you can keep going! - If you are not a hot tea drinker, there is also iced tea, lemonade, and hot chocolate! -They sell grilled cheese sandwiches with pesto for $4.50 ish. I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that the pesto grilled cheese was amazing. -This place gets packed with wifi hogs. You've been warned. I really like the vibe of this place. It's a good place to catch up with a friend or study, and I like that it's on the quiet side of things. They usually are out of most of the teas on the menu, but there are still at least 50 types. I will definitely be returning here soon!\n",
      "Not as fancy as Dobra Tea across the street but it's a comfortable place to meet people work, study, read comma or relax. They have a great selection of Teas and coffee the staff is personable and if asked will give her a recommendation without a lecture about tea.\n",
      "Love how they serve their tea if you get a pot of tea. It's also a great study spot, especially since you can get sushi for lunch here. I usually get the spicy tuna roll, and it's a pretty large portion size. There are plenty of plugs and the wifi is usually pretty good too.\n",
      "Huge fan of Te! Always a great experience every time I come. The atmosphere is cozy, nice friendly staff who all know what they are talking about. Not sure what to order? they will for sure help you out! I'm a fan of Dragon Pearl Jasmine...yum! Great place to read a book, do some work, or just hang out with friends. They have awesome fruit smoothies, made with REAL fruit! I've gotten them for breakfast a few times, also NYC famous H&H bagels, you cant go wrong grabbing something on the go here. I get some tea to take home from time to time, there are tons to pick from its hard to choose! Their daily teas are always changing and are a great way to try something you may not think you would have chosen yourself. All in all I think Te is great, I don't how they do it but they do it well.\n",
      "Certainly up there as one of my favorite spots in town to study. The overall ambiance is very conducive to being productive: comfortable chairs, good lighting, a great selection of music at the appropriate volume, and of course the warm tasty beverages that are an absolute steal. This place has the most robust hot chocolate lineup I have ever seen, with the Mexican chocolate being my favorite. Free wi-fi, with no necessary password, makes things all the more convenient. I also love how this place caters to those who want to study/read. Sure light conversation does occur, but I hope it stays that way such not to detract from the great study vibe this place engenders.\n",
      "I came in for the first time, sat down to setup my computer, and within 2 minutes had a server telling me that if I do not order anything I will have to leave. I'm not sure if I was being judged by the way I looked (wearing sweatpants and ratty t-shirt), or if this is standard practice. I was planning on staying and purchasing a drink, but found this treatment extremely rude and uncomfortable. Do not plan on returning.\n",
      "Amazing place to read or just relax, lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Some of their lower priced teas aren't thrilling (especially the greens) but you get what you pay for. The only problem I see arising is, if you buy a pot which is the best deal, you get a neat tray that comes with a timer, a cup for drinking, and a cup to hold the used leaves. If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead. I might be mistaken but they really should have party tray type tea sets. Still, 5 stars for sure. Excellent service, eclectic music (classical one day, indie the next), good ambiance, good price, decent hours (I wish they would open a bit earlier, but they close so late that it makes up for it), and some really amazing teas mixed in. Free wifi makes it even better.\n",
      "Great selection of teas. sushi are fresh, but I don't like the sushi rice they used, much sticky than I thought for sushi rice\n",
      "I'm a graduate student here in Pittsburgh, and this is one of two main places I go when I want to get work done. The tea selection is excellent, and the staff was excellent - everyone knows the teas very well.\n",
      "I only wish they offered sugar. However, good atmosphere. If you wanted to have a decent conversation with a friend of interest, this place is currently ideal. The Chai is amazing.\n",
      "A neighborhood gem. Don't come here looking for lattes or other fancy coffee drinks, though - it's a TEA shop. The sushi is pretty good by Pittsburgh standards (no offense, Pittsburgh, but sushi ain't your strong suit). It's bright and sunny, which is a huge plus, but that means it can get a little warm; layer appropriately.\n",
      "Oh what wonderful, delicious, unique drinks they have! I'm a tea person and I was extremely impressed by their selections (with prices better than Teavana, mind you). It's small but beautiful (think Ikea beautiful). And damn good people work there. :)\n",
      "I love Te Cafe. I buy loose leaf tea here and also like to come in and occasionally drink a pot with a friend or my fiance. The atmosphere is great. I love it here.\n",
      "I have trouble ordering tea when I'm out because it's such a simple thing to make. I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it. However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the \"Kokeicha\". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of \"gunpowder\" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the \"Kokeicha\" was very similar. The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time. Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?\n",
      "Great selection of fairly-priced teas. Good food, too. Could be bigger, but never had a problem finding a comfortable seat. Not much to say, check it out!\n",
      "This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. The ambiance is nice, somewhat modern and chill, but still comfortable. There are board games available for playing, but most people seem to either be there with one or two other people to chat, or on their laptops making use of the wi-fi. The staff is very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, and if you need help picking something, will ask you questions to figure something out - green or oolong? floral or fruity? - and then bring out several teas for you to smell before choosing one. My favorite so far is the silk oolong, which is a smooth and slightly creamy oolong tea. I also really like the tea cups they use for Chinese teas.\n",
      "Te Cafe is one of my favorite spots in Sq. Hill! In the winter, the windows are usually nice and foggy, providing the coziest feel when you're settling in with a hot cup of tea. They also have a nice selection of pastries and sushi, so you can snack or have a tasty meal while you're there to compliment your drink. Their chai tea latte is deeeeelicious as well, highly recommended! Great prices, great service, great food & drink :)\n",
      "Really delicious tea and a good atmosphere. Everyone who works here are nice and helpful. I never feel rushed when I work on my computer. The owners are also great, and bring a nice sense of community to Squirrel Hill when you walk in. I tried the Sushi here for the first time, and was surprised that they made it on site. You get a lot for $8-$9, and it tastes yummy. Would recommend. The mulled tea is my favorite though. I'll miss it in the summer.\n",
      "Good selection of tea, plentiful seating, nice atmosphere. I had an iced hibiscus tea that was pretty great. I will definitely be returning. Also, they have outdoor seating (though it's on the Murray Ave sidewalk and a little noisy) and a clean bathroom.\n",
      "The best hidden gem sushi in pittsburgh! Great tea selection also.. highly recommend for delicious inexpensive delivery sushi\n",
      "Perhaps one of the best tea/cafe experiences in Pittsburgh. Hands down, this place is off the charts. The ambiance, employees, and tea are the best in Pittsburgh. Their selection of tea is impressively large. The cafe is also a great place to study.\n",
      "I can't think of a better to way to spend a lazy sunday afternoon than a pot of oolong, a copy of the sunday times, and just sitting back and relaxing at the Te Cafe.\n",
      "I've come here twice and have to say their tea selection is fantastic. There are so many different kinds of teas and I appreciate the variety they offer in terms of food + ambiance + teas. I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it. I was hoping it would be better since they do specialize in tea but I do realize that doesn't necessarily mean their bubble tea would be good since in my opinion that is a whole different category. I would come back strictly for their hot teas but definitely not the bubble tea.\n",
      "Every tea and tea-related concoction I have had here has been great. The atmosphere is bright and warm. They must have taken the other poster's music complaint into account, because I have heard a wide variety of great stuff every time I have been in there. The staff is always super-friendly (without being annoying) and the clientele is usually a good mix of studying students/laptop users and people actually having conversations. In short, good tea, good tea-related creations, good service, good music, good place to study or have a chat.\n",
      "Te Cafe does tea well.They have an outstanding selection of teas, and they are very careful with brewing and all of that. They also have a nice selection of board games and big tables to play on, which is a nice addition. One thing kills it for me: the music is ABYSMAL. New age, strummy folky wispy Lilith fair crap every time. I still keep coming back from time to time when I have a tea craving but WOW.\n",
      "Even if you're not in the mood for something from Te Cafe's diverse tea selection, there are plenty of other drinks that satisfy: tea lattes, lemonades (both plain and with unusual flavors like ginger, lemonade and hibiscus), hot chocolates and more. The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations. The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people. The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do. It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin. Grilled cheese sandwiches and vegetable soup are recent additions to the cafe's menu. While the soup is clearly from the can, it and the grilled cheese are nourishing. I definitely appreciate not having to pack up all my study materials and leave in search of a decent meal. I really like the feeling of community that Te Cafe fosters with an area for posters and fliers for upcoming local events and work by local artists on the walls. The cafe also hosts occasional poetry readings, but unfortunately I've never been able to attend one.\n",
      "This is my favorite place to go in Squirrel Hill. There's so many different drink and tea options, I have to keep going back to try everything! The atmosphere is really nice and chill too- perfect for reading, sketching, studying, etc. I only wish there were more pastry/dessert options, other than just tarts and biscotti. It may actually be a good thing (for my wallet) though... haha.\n",
      "Started going to the Te' when they first opened. The two ladies that run the place are very nice and good to talk to. The teas are excellent! I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent. The atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done. I don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there. Seriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place.\n",
      "They have outlets almost everywhere and the seats are extremely comfortable. I had a Kyoto Cherry Rose tea that was absolutely incredible. The staff really knows their tea, the presentation is wonderful, and the atmosphere is beyond pleasant. They also have a few board and card games. Go for work or a game night with friends!\n",
      "This place is super cute! I went here with my bestie (visiting from CBus) and she said it reminded her of Zen Cha, which I can see. You can order pots of tea, sushi, other drinks and real meals! We got a pot of their Apricot black tea to share. It had enough for about 2 refills and the set it came with was adorable! Taste was rich and fruity and made me want to go back for another flavor! My friend got their sashimi bowl and it looked awesome! It made a nice, light lunch for her and the price wasn't outrageous. I see that they have crepes too so will definitely have to drag the hubs here to order all new stuff! They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere. Some other reviewers mentioned this but the smell of this place really wasn't appetizing--must be due to the combo of fish + tea? The owners were nice enough but they don't start selling their savory dishes until after a certain time which was not listed on the menus. So don't come here too early on the weekends!\n",
      "Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider. Cozy atmosphere, generally quiet, would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea.\n",
      "Nice basement/attic feeling where it feels like it's probably what your house feels like\n",
      "I can't believe all this time I did not write a review for Té Cafe. Since I came to Pittsburgh 4 years ago, this place has been my favorite location for some serious work. Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself. They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from. If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you. Side warning: I love the comfy chair and I'll give you mean stares if you happen to occupy it :)\n",
      "I love this place, it's become my go-to take out sushi place. The owners are very friendly people, the atmosphere is charming and quiet, the tea is very delicious and varied, and the sushi is excellent at a cheap price. I come here at least once a week now.\n",
      "I love buying a pot of tea and studying here. It's always quiet, there's a ton of outlets, and you can always get free refills of hot water. It has a great, relaxing environment. Their lavender lemonade is great as is their plum berry white tea. I wish they had more room. The one thing they can definitely improve upon is their bathroom. The toilet is almost always broken and it never seems too clean.\n",
      "Not a tea drinker myself, but I stumble in here about three or four times a year to buy tea for my mom for various gifts. Every time I've been in, the staff's been great with suggestions, samples, patience, etc. Went in again yesterday, and again...totally great. For being a clueless meathead, I was treated with no condescension, just the barista's enthusiasm for tea. One of the good businesses in Squirrel Hill I'm happy to support.\n",
      "I recently moved away from Pittsburgh, but this is one of the spots I miss the most. I spent many hours here working on my thesis, but also many hours here just hanging out with friends or reading a book. The people who work there are very friendly and very patient. When I first started stopping in, I knew very little about tea, and they always took the time to explain different properties of each type of tea and were able to make thoughtful suggestions for things they thought I should try based on my current mood and goals for the day. One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter. The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop. The atmosphere is inviting, and only rarely would it be too crowded to find a place to sit. The wi-fi was much more reliable than other places in the area. I love this place! If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh, I'm going to make it a point to stop in. Keep up the great work!\n",
      "This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I prefer drinking tea or smoothies if I'm sitting at a cafe and Te Cafe is perfect for that. It's a very chilled out place, got big windows and all kinds of seating. It's not the fanciest cafe around, which is actually nice, because it has a very comfortable vibe to it. They have free and unlimited wifi. The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there. They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins. Great place, check it out!\n",
      "Really interesting tea flavors. Stop by if your in the neighborhood.\n",
      "That's my second time here, and I'm so happy that i've discovered that place! Very comfortable and relaxing atmoshere, delicious teas and huge variet varieties them! Friendly, always kind and heping stuff! That's one if my favorite places now!!!!\n",
      "Aw, I love it. It looks like a really great study area. I would come here to study. Also they give you a pot of tea with free hot water refills. That would be perfect for studying. Also, the guy working there was really helpful with suggestions. And the place inside is just super chill.\n",
      "Can't vouch for the sushi as I only stopped by for a lunch time snack. Tried the sandwich of the day which was a grilled cheese pannini and I have the iced chai latte. Both were tasty and reasonably priced. Staff was friendly and place was clean and comfortable. If I was living in this area I could see myself coming in here on a pretty regular basis.\n",
      "With a calm, peaceful atmosphere, a very friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a wide selection of great quality products, I would definitely recommend this place. Both the iced chai tea latte and the sparkling tea were excellent, and I'm sure that their other stuff is great too. I'm definitely going to have to make a point of coming back.\n",
      "I wouldn't have guessed that a tea cafe would sell sushi but my friend recommended to try this place. Ordered the Twin City Roll which had tuna, salmon, avocado, and cucumbers. There was more sushi than rice so the ratio was good. The sushi looked good and I thought the price was reasonable. But when I was eating it, the sushi didn't seem fresh. There was a strong fish smell and the aftertaste left a slimy feeling on my tongue. The interior of the cafe also had a weird smell... I don't know how to describe it exactly. I don't think sushi and tea smells go well together? I don't know if I would recommend coming here for sushi. Maybe their tea is better as it is a tea cafe.\n",
      "I've been shopping at this mall since I was a child and in the last couple years they've really outdone themselves by doing a total makeover and renovation. The whole interior is a lot more trendy and reflective of our times and the big name brands and boutiques that have settled in the Mail. Everything is a glossy white marble, clean and sleek. Lots of natural sunlight coming from glass rooftop openings. The food court is also impressive, they've expanded the seating area by shutting down one of the stores on the side. Color combination and lighting makes this place a whole lot more appealing. Since the building of the Dix 30 mega outdoor shopping lifestyle complex, Mail Champlain has had to renew itself to retain shoppers. The opening of the Forever 21 store was one of their best moves. They also appeal to a higher class of shoppers with big brands like BCBG and Browns shoes. Even The Bay has undergone a slight revamp - on the main floor, they've rearranged their handbag and shoe department to make way for name brands. I used to see mostly elderly people wandering around during the week, it didn't seem like a popular hangout place for youngings but that has changed. Mail Champlain has a bit of everything for all ages, tastes and budgets. The only thing missing might be a pharmacy, they used to have a Jean Coutu but it closed down.\n",
      "une de mes places préférées pour magasiner sur la Rive-Sud ! Surtout pendant l'hiver puisque c'est intérieur donc pas besoin de geler au coton en changeant de magasins!! Il y a beaucoup de boutiques dont un H&M, un forever 21, un Archambault, etc! Il y a aussi plusieurs fast food pour te rassaisir après une bonne journee de magasinage intensive ! Il manque cependant quelques boutiques phares tel un Simons, mais ça fait l'affaire pour une virée shopping dans ton heure de lunch :) !!\n",
      "Though this mall is smaller and less variety compared to others around it, I still love to come here as there are a few shops which are not in Promenade St Bruno. The food court is OK, not the best but the mall is cute and easy to navigate around. I love the Yves Rocher here, great little salon inside. Also the fact that there is a huge sirens store here which has way more variety than Dix30. When the weather is like today (raining) we end up at this indoor mall instead of the outdoor Dix30 and love the atmosphere here. It was the first mall I visited in Montreal so I hold many fond memories of the place :)\n",
      "This is my 9 year olds review. Hamburgers are great and the cheese curds are awesome. There is a Great Lake View\n",
      "So I know Christy's is a Madison tradition with those lovely views of Lake Waubesa. But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area. There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well; so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza/sandwich menu.\n",
      "Great scenery. Solid food. Great energy! A must in the summer!!\n",
      "This place has such potential but the service SUCKS! And I wrote that in capital letters on purpose. You literally have to stare a waitress down and even if you make eye contact you're lucky if they will stop at your table. Come on! We boat on the lake and wish there were better options than this. I guess it's Waypoint every time! As a side note: I'm writing this on a Sunday afternoon as I've been sitting at an outside table for over 15 minutes without one of the three servers currently working even acknowledging us! I really wanted the Shrimp Christy's. (Because it's fantastic!) Oh well. There probably won't be a next time either!\n",
      "Unless you're a local yokel McFarland douchebag, you won't get any measure of service here. After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service. Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible. I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both. And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy). So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland.\n",
      "Great volleyball courts! The sand is soft but at night, some of the lights will shine right in your face and obstruct your view while you're playing. There is a hose and area to rinse off afterwards, by the dock facing the beautiful, glistening Lake Waubesa. A cherry bomb will run you $7 and a Vodka 7 will run you about $5 or so. Be careful when you order the pizza, you start with either a 12\" ($8.99) or 16\" ($10.99) cheese and each topping is $1.50! My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100! On Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it. Every time you were ready for more, just ask the nice bartender to give you more shells (corn hard shell or soft flour tortillas).\n",
      "Great food, great environment, low key, full bar plus a tiki bar in the summer! Best nachos I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Overall just a chill, consistently great place that in the summer is the place to be if you like the sun lake and boating. Been looking for a place like this\n",
      "Menu is short. Excellent black bean veggie burger and seasoned waffle fries. Old fashioneds are made from scratch/muddled. I had excellent service while there--nice, competent bartender came outside to refill drinks several times. It was a comfortable experience, relaxing outside watching the waves. Veggie people beware taxidermied animals inside.\n",
      "Good food, drinks, and views. Great place to come by boat in the summer!\n",
      "Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio last Sunday listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture. Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!\n",
      "Love going here during the summer. Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching. Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh. Food was bland an uninspired. What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered. After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner. Walleye sandwich was just OK. Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors. The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip. The kitchen and management could do a lot better. Probably will not go here again for dinner. Too bad because we do like the place overall.\n",
      "I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid.\n",
      "I'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews. We were made to feel very welcome as soon as we sat at the bar by Tim the bartender. He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills). As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so.\n",
      "Decent but not great. OK as far as bar food goes. Very smokey.\n",
      "Worst service ever. we arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night. Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait. We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us. Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2 (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks. 30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was \"didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?\" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they \"were just catching up\". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area. 5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it.\n",
      "I've been here a few times. The cheese curds and fries are nice. Onion rings ok. Wings my kids love but I think they are too smothered in sauce. Each time I've been here It was by boat so we've sat out side. I would have rated it a 3 or 4 except each and every table has an ash tray which is gross and they allow smoking in the entire area. My kids 6 and 11 were with us and one has asthma so we had to move to get out of the smoke. Very inconsiderate allowing smoking, only 3 out of maybe 40 people were smoking so maybe inconvenience 3 people and not everyone else. Going forward Ill probably just get takeout.\n",
      "We tried the fish fry a few weeks ago after hearing great reviews from friends. We weren't disappointed. Everything was wonderful. Tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite. The lobster bisque was cold ( Apparently, they forgot to turn the burner on and we were the first to mention it. We were there at 8:00pm.). The fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold. My husband asked why we didn't get any bread. He was told that they ran out. We found that interesting since people who were seated after we were had bread. Not sure we need to go back.\n",
      "Just got back from this restaurant for the third time. It is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there. This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait). About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us. No one ever did so we left. The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best.\n",
      "This place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere. Their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu, buy they don't seem to see this as a problem. I requested my favorite beer: \"Oh, we're out of that.\" Then, my second favorite: \"We're out of that too.\" As a vegetarian, I had to order a black bean burger, which was burned, as was the bun. I asked for a dark or spicy mustard. No, they just have the mainstream basics. Combine this with extremely mediocre service. I will never eat there again.\n",
      "Unfortunately we had really high hopes for this place mostly because we noticed All You Can Eat Taco Bar on the website but apparently the websitr was not correct/up to date so we were left with other options. The waffle fries were delicious, wraps were average and a little pricey, and service was fair (even in the off season). Can definitely see the appeal during the summer but it won't be a place I seek for good eats and drink.\n",
      "I was actually quite surprised at how good the fish fry was. I had some great hashbrowns with it and my wife really enjoyed the salad that accompanied the meal. If you're a craft beer lover like myself, you'll be disappointed in their beer selection, but Christy's is worth a visit solely for their fish fry.\n",
      "Drove out on the bikes on a gorgeous Sunday. It wasn't overly crowded. Overlooks the lake and many people dock their boats and enjoy the patio and food. Lots of people taking food back out onto their boats. Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat. We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want. The menus at the table were all different. Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the \"baskets\" on it. Weird!! The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water. When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it. After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better. It finally was. The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well. Overall, the food was good. Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy. The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return. The place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!\n",
      "A great neighborhood hangout with good food and great beer. This is THE place to be on a summer night, and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter. The place is loaded with character(s) and is a true Wisconsin tavern on the lake.\n",
      "Today I had another session with Les. I was having so much pain in my foot I thought I was going to have to give up dance. Les did a combination of multiple modalities on me including lymphatic drainage, chiropractic massage, Russian massage to realign my leg and foot. I was very relaxed and even when he had to use more pressure on the reflexology, it was fine. He diagnosed that I had a tight inner thigh muscle and he got it to release. Les is so experienced and can read your body and diagnose where your physical issues are. I am telling all my friends about his work!\n",
      "Les is just incredible!! I participate in a number of sports and work my muscles to the max. A typical week includes 6 hours of high-intensity interval training as well as three to four 3-6 mile runs. As a public speaker, I spend 8-hours per day standing on high heels. Massage is not a \"luxury\" for me nor is it about relaxation - it is about allowing me to continue to do the things I love without pain. Until I began going to Advanced Body Therapy, I did not think that was possible. Les is fantastic in the office and encourages me to continue my active lifestyle by even showing me stretches I can do at home.\n",
      "Les is the Masseuse Master. Had a Deep Tissue massage this morning and it was great!\n",
      "Again.... Les has worked his magic on me. Just 1 visit & already I have less pain & more mobility in my injured knee.\n",
      "A really good sandwich place. It's location is a little unusual but very convenient to the surrounding airport hotels. The turkey, avocado bot was great.\n",
      "The food was definitely solid but what stood out the most for me was the friendly staff and the iced coffee they whipped up. Wish I had got their largest size. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Great place to grab lunch. The location is a little hidden. It's in an office building. There is shaded outside seating. The food was fresh and my sandwich tasted great. My only complaint was that the potato salad had too much dill in it.\n",
      "What a find, right behind the Radisson, fresh cheap and delicious. Friendly staff. Give it a try.\n",
      "I work in a office building right around the corner from them. The place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back. Honest to God, the food is addictive. My faves are the Italian Hoagie (reminds me of home back East) and the Chipotle Chicken sandwich. And I also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it. Staff is friendly too which makes the experience even better! I'm a fan!\n",
      "I can't figure out why their food isn't that great. They seem to use good quality products. Been there for breakfast and lunch and its meh.\n",
      "Only open for lunch spot, a nice little sandwich shop hidden behind the Radisson. I had the Grilled Fiesta Chicken Wrap and really enjoyed it. Pretty large sandwiches from what I can tell and looking forward to trying other options, as well. Being from out of town, you can tell it has its regulars and people really like this lunch place.\n",
      "After arriving at PHX airport we searched for a nearby lunch option and this was well reviewed. It was a little difficult to find. It's hidden in a larger building with very little signage. Also the parking lot has signs about hotel guests only etc.. so that was a little unnerving. They were closing soon when we came in, but we ordered a BLT and a southwest chicken panini. Both were ready quickly and were very good.\n",
      "I have visited The Lunch Lounge 3 times since one of their workers stopped by my office and dropped off a menu and some yummy cookies. The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do. My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came. Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich \"your way\" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread... To say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's\n",
      "Happy to have found this place! Great food, decent prices, friendly staff. This makes me a more-than-once-a-week patron! And they will even accomodate an off-menu request as long as they have the ingredients. Thanks, Fred!\n",
      "I absolutely love this place! In fact, probably my favorite sandwich spot. A hidden gem. I eat here atlas once a week. I have yet to have one bad thing. My favorite sandwiches are the Queen of Clubs ( like the King of clubs, but with only a double decker not a triple decker) and the tuna melt. The cobb and garden of eden salad are my favorites. Their sandwiches and salads are pretty big, so go with an appetite. Its a mom and pop sandwich shop, which I love. Try it out! You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "Tucked in behind the Radisson at the corner of an office park, this is a great alternative to the food in the local hotels. I had the Cobb salad. Despite the generic iceberg lettuce it was enhanced with fresh spinach, avocado and egg and everything else was fresh. Good dressing and generous portions. As others have said come before noon or after 1 o'clock if you don't want to wait in line. Three nice tables outside with a little lawn view.\n",
      "an excellent place for lunch, the food is great the service too! always friendly, never pushy, as one guy said, i like the 'tude of the lounge lady...i call it the the lunch lizard and its off the beaten path but you wont go wrong with thier specials or anything on the menu for that matter. the outside seating is nice, i try to eat here regularly...beats any chain sammich shop!\n",
      "i am not a fan of turkey so when i asked the sandwich guy for his recommendation, and he suggested the albuquerque turkey, i was unsure, nevetheless i went on to try it and boy! Was i glad? The sandwich comes with fresh cole slawish salad, bacon cooked just right crisp and retaining its flavor, generous slice of turkey and to top it off chile mayo which is really what separates this sandwich from the other diners... .all in all a great sandwich...made to perfection. I want to come here and try other items on the menu... They all look good....hopefully on my next trip to phoenix.\n",
      "Great service in a quick-bite-to-eat, make-your-own-sandwich spot. Most of the business probably wanders from those office buildings. People looked lost and in their own heads as they would methodically make their way. It is a sunny day at 74° but it's clear that's it's Friday at the office. Anyway back to the food- Choices for breads cheese meats veggies Chips and soda Pretty standard with more selections available too Sandwich was well prepared and tasted as expected. Note: Almost gave them four stars because the cashier is a Colts fan but we all make choices and their good service and food shouldn't suffer from his choice to root for the Colts. I joke, I joke. Also, Go Patriots. :)\n",
      "Good food at a small lunch restaurant, it is a good place to pick up lunch if in the area but it is not a destination lunch spot. More of a business man's quick stop.\n",
      "I have been to the Lunch Lounge many times for lunch and love the chicken salad. It is the best! I also love the BLT's. Today I stopped in for breakfast and had the breakfast panini sandwich and I am once again impressed. Thank you Lunch Lounge!!!\n",
      "Ordered the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and it was still frozen in the middle. FROZEN! I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way. I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it. By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one. This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only. My Panini alone was over $8 after tax. Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side. I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back.\n",
      "I eat here at least once a week all of their sandwiches and salads are always fresh and delicious and every 9 salads or sandwiches you buy you get the 10th on FREE. Goodstuff! Glad it's near my work.\n",
      "Love this place. Weekly specials are amazing. Great, fast, and friendly service. I'd highly recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Today I had the hot pastrami with on the side. The sandwich and the slaw: EXCELLENT! The staff is great. I'm flying today so I also purchased a pb&j on grain bread for later. I'm sure it will be awesome too.\n",
      "Excellent little hidden spot. Great menu with fair prices. Had the Breakfast burrito with a cup of coffee. Outstanding burrito! Loads of cheese & stuffings. The menu on yelp is a little outdated but the prices are more than reasonable. Definetly give this place a try.\n",
      "Great sandwich shop near several airport hotels. They also serve salads at lunchtime, and breakfast starting at 7:00 AM. Alas, wasn't in town long enough to sample the breakfast, but lunch was fantastic. Small but very popular at lunch when I was there\n",
      "Had lunch here. Very close to work but only found out about it through yelp. My sandwich was delicious and the staff was super friendly. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "For a little sandwich shop in an office park, this place is great. Delicious, big breakfast burrito. No problem to substitute avocado for the meat. Hot tasty coffee. friendly staff. Outdoor seating option. All for under $6. So glad I didn't have the more expensive breakfast in my corporate airport hotel.\n",
      "I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!\n",
      "What a find! While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk. We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini. Both were excellent! The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both. The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches. We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday. If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Excellent sandwich luncheon spot! The Albuquerque Turkey Panini is fantastic! Green chili mayo? Who knew? I had to buy some to go! Fresh vegetables and Boar's head meat. Warning if you order a cold sub sandwich the bread is a bit too much. It's loaded with goodies but it's too much bread.\n",
      "Great breakfast panini for $5. More affordable than a breakfast or brunch chain for sure. Nothing for breakfast is over $5 which makes this a spot I will recommend and more than likely come back to next trip. Iced coffee is only $1 till 11 and breakfast is served til 11.\n",
      "Amazing lunch. Fresh Boars Head meats. Fresh bread (marble rye is awesome) and tr staff is great. One of the best sandwiches in the Phoenix area. Don't miss this place. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Worth finding - a little awkward the first time, but I don't regret having to drive the block an extra time! The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!\n",
      "Food is good and location is convenient. Service is terrible - even the owner - the older woman acts like its an inconvenience to help people. We have had the opportunity to give her more business but decided against it because of the service. Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though. Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast. Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well. Overall: Great little lunch cafe!\n",
      "SImple to find and great custom made food. Sandwiches, Chips and Drink. No frills but delicious.\n",
      "First time for breakfast. Waiting for someone at sky harbor. Breakfast burrito outstanding. A meal in a tortilla. Very tasty and really inexpensive. I'll be back!!\n",
      "Great little local place with tasty food. Be diligent in finding it as it isn't obvious from the main street. Minimal seating for eat-in so plan ahead. Friendly staff, good prices.\n",
      "If you work in the area and have not been here, GO IMMEDIATELY! I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area. The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative. Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!\n",
      "I picked this spot out because of Yelp. I was looking to walk from my hotel (Aloft) and it's just down the street. Pay attentuon to the signs. It's in the back of a building that blends in with the rest. I had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and ready in about 3 minutes. Seemed like good friendly sevice. Portion was perfect and prices were reasonable.\n",
      "Awesome find! Stopped in for breakfast on the run and will probably come back for lunch. The guys are super nice... Coffee is amazing!\n",
      "Great little sandwich shop tucked into the office plaza (Follow the sandwich board signs to find it). I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces. Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another. Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!\n",
      "It is hard to locate but just look for a small sign stating there are just hiding in the back! (: The set up is nice with an option to eat indoors/outdoors although I wouldn't recommend bringing large parties. Customer service was good and the food was delicious! I had to go with the BLT which, they did not shy away with the bacon. I wouldn't mind visiting back for lunch again.\n",
      "I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work.\n",
      "Great little lunch spot! Fresh food. Something for everybody. Long line at lunch though. We had our food within 15/20 minutes from the line at the door.\n",
      "Was in Phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful haunt near the airport. I had the best lunch ever - a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini. OMG! The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli. I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience! I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin. My client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix! I can't wait to share the secret!\n",
      "Tasty and fast. They primarily serve the corporate crowd so keep that in mind if you visit during prime lunch hours.\n",
      "I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served.. Finally she said \"whenever your ready..\". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me. I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways.\n",
      "Tucked away in a very boring looking business park, you can sneak in for a great sandwich. Go around the corner and look for the Boar's Head sign. I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!\n",
      "I had the Egg-Cellent Burrito. Its name is not representative of the taste. It indeed did have eggs, but not the greatest tasting. They pulled the burrito out of the microwave so I assume that's how they cook it. I'd recommend checking something else out next time.\n",
      "I stopped in last Friday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast burrito. The service was fast, and not only was the breakfast burrito reasonably priced, but it was also enormous.\n",
      "Yum! Good food and they deliver on Amazon Restaurants! I will certainly be ordering again. I was particularly happy with the carb free option for breakfast. We had a happy breakfast crowd.\n",
      "Awesome meal. Very willing to make adjustments and recommendations. Would come back here in a heartbeat.\n",
      "This place is ridiculous! Wasn't expecting much from a deli sandwiched between office buildings, but wow! This place is just across the street from where I work and everyone is blown away by the food. The staff is super friendly and the food is really fresh. The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer.\n",
      "Just paid my first visit to this place and I will definitely be back. I tried the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and my co-worker had the Hot Roast Beef Press. Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next. Plenty of off-street parking. I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not). Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)? I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit.\n",
      "The Lunch Lounge is absolutely delicious and fresh! Everyone is always there with a smile on their faces serving up yummy sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I haven't had one thing on the menu that I have not enjoyed. It is the perfect mom n pop shop of a deli!\n",
      "I got the southwest chipotle chicken panini and it was good but not great. It also cost $7.99+ tax which is too expensive for a sandwich with no sides or drinks. I would come here again if a friend wanted to eat here but i wont come back again on my own accord.\n",
      "Really good sandwich. I love having my lunch here. I usually buy Veggie Sandwich and I ask them to grill it. Tastes really good and affordable too.\n",
      "Hidden cafe with outside seating. Don't let the name fool you...they also serve breakfast. Great prices including my 1$ coffee!\n",
      "Needed to find a quick easily accessible place for my kids and myself to eat and this place was in walking distance right behind Radisson hotel where we're staying at. Was able to find something for all of us. Pb&j's for the kids and a hot pastrami for me. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly. Quick, easy and much healthier than the fast food chains. Would of course recommended and return to the lunch lounge. Might actually get me some coffee there tomorrow morning.\n",
      "This place is located in a prime spot for travelers as well as office workers. The menu is a diverse and creative mix on standard lunch box fare. Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch. I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch. The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning.\n",
      "Ashley is a great photographer! She took my maternity photos and newborn photos of my daughter. The pictures came out amazing, she did such a great job. She was so much fun to work with and made you feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend her to anyone needing a photographer and will continue to use her in the future. :)\n",
      "Ashley shot our Christmas card and we had the best time with her, plus she's a complete professional! Our two dogs were there and she was so patient with them and also helpful when trying to get them to look at the camera. She came prepared, had different variations of props to best suit us and was truly a joy to work with. Since our shoot, we eloped and are now married but when we were shooting, I told her we had been engaged in April but never did an engagement shoot. After that, every single shot she took she made an effort to show off my ring! I am looking forward to working with Ashley again for our maternity and future family photo sessions! :) Thanks again for everything, Ashley!\n",
      "Ashley took newborn photos for my daughter. She was so detailed, warm & made it fun. Not to mention the pictures turned out beyond beautiful. I look at them often (years later) and tear up. Ashley really captured those moments you want to remember forever. We will absolutely be using her for future pictures.\n",
      "Great photographer who took beautiful pictures of my grandchildren. Attention to detail is impeccable, customer service is outstanding and the cost is comparable.\n",
      "Much better! I frequent the Charlotte area for work. I previously tried the Golden Crust and honestly I was not impressed. I just went back this past Saturday not for any cooked food but for prepackaged goods. I shared my dissatisfaction with the manager and she shared things have changed for the better. A new cook has been hired and she offered samples of oxtail which was tender, well-seasoned and delicious. She also shared a hot flaky fried dumpling, YUM! I'm pleased that the management and cook has changed they are now representing Caribbean food well.\n",
      "What I had was good .. jerk chicken combo with rice and cabbage and gravy on top , and a patty .. very tasty, will stop back 3.6 to 4\n",
      "I was SO excited to see Golden Krust outside NY so I had to stop in while in the shopping center. My curry goat was SO delicious and had all the right flavor and spice. The flavors reminded me of the great food I used to get when I lived near a Jamaican area in Brooklyn!\n",
      "Prepare to be flexible because a lot of things run out. The food is ok but I tried it because of the lunch specials. I wanted Mac and cheese they'd ran out. Ok, sucked that up because I prob didn't need it anyway. The vegetables and rice to me was very bland. The staff is not friendly and customer service is poor. Don't come here with a lot of expectations.\n",
      "I really enjoy Jamaican food and was excited to see a Golden Krust in Charlotte. The food was average and I didn't get to try the items I really wanted or any patties. I came in at 11:15 and they told me that most of the menu wouldn't be out til noon. I may come back to try the patties.\n",
      "I've been going to Golden Krust since the franchise came to Charlotte. Food is always great. The prices are reasonable. Service is just OK. On busy nights like Friday and Saturday they have run out of certain items. I don't know how authentic the food is but it is on par with other Caribbean spots in town. Over all, I do recommend Gold Krust to get your Caribbean fix.\n",
      "Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......\n",
      "No frills, just good Caribbean curry to go. Goat curry lunch special is under $8.00 with tax. And they have other specials daily while they last. This is a franchise so like all franchises there are certain guarantees in terms of food style and quality and ingredients, but there's also a sense of family here which doesn't exist in all offbeat chain restaurants.\n",
      "Golden Krust is decent Caribbean for fairly cheap prices. If you don't have high expectations for service or want to be \"wowed\" with food, you won't be too disappointed. On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10). The food itself is pretty good. I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards. The meat portions was kinda slim. But the service? A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place. The line was long and the staff were slow to move. Geez! My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour. RUDE! I had to walk around it to get a drink refill. If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place. I'm sure that there is a Caribbean joint with more personable service and exceptional food.\n",
      "I am so glad that they got one of these stores here in Charlotte North Carolina I have been trying to find it I found you found Golden Krust Bakery you must eat their the best you're making pulled ever wish they had more big location that is just a little too far for me to get but I get there when I can try it you will love it Golden Krust the best ever\n",
      "If I could give this place 6 stars or more, I DEFINITELY WOULD! I always recommend this place to everyone. Outside of the place doesn't due justice to what deliciousness is served inside!\n",
      "Food is just okay.. Their portion sizes for the amount you are paying is terrible.. You get more Styrofoam than food and I don't like paying $10 FOR Styrofoam. They need to give you a better value. If you are going to cut portions on the meats at least put a good portion of rice so you feel like you got something.. The ones in NEWYork are much better. imho\n",
      "Pretty good Caribbean Food, Nice location, and decent service. They use to be a lot better years ago. It's a little overpriced for the portions you get, but overall it's ok and I'll probably return\n",
      "Bland food. I don't even know how you can make jerk chicken bland but they managed. The customer service is mediocre. I just recommend going elsewhere.\n",
      "I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and always received pretty decent service. The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit. I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible. While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked \"how old is the bread?\" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying \"the bread is fresh.\" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything. After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there.\n",
      "This place is NOT Caribbean food! It's terrible. You must ask for a drink separate from the combo even though you've ordered a combo. They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!!!!!\n",
      "The jerk sauce tastes like bbq sauce from a bottle mixed with ketchup! I should've known to keep walking when I didn't see any customers. Never again.\n",
      "Golden Krust really does live up to the name. I ordered Jerk Chicken with a shrimp Jamaican patty. The Jamaican patty had such a crispy, well put together crust. It was probably the best Jamaican patty I've ever had. If you're in the Charlotte area & you like Caribbean food, it's definitely a spot to look into.\n",
      "Love the veggie patties, when they are available...haven't really eaten anything else there.\n",
      "The food here is really good, if you are in the mood for Jamaican food this restaurant is great. The sell cakes and patties which are very good. They get a four star because their portions could be better for the price.\n",
      "It has been awhile since I've been to Golden Krust and I remembered this place being pretty good but things have sadly changed. Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.\n",
      "The roti here is an improvement on the other Jamaican restaurants I've eaten at in Charlotte. I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail. I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available.\n",
      "Right off the bat, don't go to this place expecting warm and cheery service. Just focus on the food to keep your satisfaction levels in check. I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed. This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat. I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner. Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection.\n",
      "This is a nice spot for some of your Caribbean needs. You should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the University Area. It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place. The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices. I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal. I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy. It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though. Kinda a bummer on that part. The place is alright, pretty small. They have tables near the register, and also near the back. I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out. The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it.\n",
      "Was given three prices for The ox tail combination additionally they did not have any fountain drinks or ice had to pay an extra dollar for a canna Coke in addition to the meal that should have included a drink, according to the menu\n",
      "Food is good, price is good I can't take that away from them to be fair. However I ordered a combo that included a drink and Jamaican bread(forgive my ignorance). I paid with my debit card then when I got my food that's when the woman informed me their drink machine was down, and they were out of the Jamaican bread. Which she then immediately followed up with \" no refunds\".\n",
      "Delicious food!!! I have been coming to this Caribbean Restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago. I must admit there was a decline in the food quality about a year ago due to a change in chefs. I did stop coming during that time. I stopped in about a week ago to give it another try. I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct. I food was scrumptious just as I remembered!! Keep up the good work!! I'll be back and I'm putting the word out.\n",
      "FOOD IS GREAT. The service is average. The prices are cheap so you tend to get idiots in there who have no manners. I recommend, taking the food to go or sitting in the back.\n",
      "This food was not my favorite I spent about $12 and barely ate any of it. I went on my lunch and was driving and eating very disappointed. I may try this place one more time in hopes of better flavor.\n",
      "Tis De Place Mon! First Off me Being from one of the best cities in the world. NYC i know good west indian food and this hit the nail on the head! Great to the point service, with hardy plates not for the quickly filled stomachs here! Try the cuury goat! and the beef patties!! and a DG Soda! best in carribean food in charlotte, nc! This is truly the mirror image of true carribeen food! anything else is just a watered down xerox copy. then even have the spice bread and pastries! Best for lunch $5-6, and dinner $8-10.\n",
      "Ive been going here for yrs ...as a NYer I'm familiar with the chain. The foods good but I'm never going back. They've lost me and numerous family members. I wonder if they changed management or something because their portion sizing are horrendous! Theyve scaled back so much and still charge the same thing! I'm not paying for Styrofoam! Then if you ask for more rice you get told \"no!\" What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5. But the service and portions a 1. Shame I stopped getting plates and stuck to beef patties but then they stopped serving cheese beef and never bothered to have them again or remove it from the menu. Ill be going to the other Caribbean restaurant up the street from now on.\n",
      "Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long.\n",
      "If I could give this place 10 stars I would !!! I loved the food and the service was VERY FAST ! I loved everything and the small plate filled me up I couldn't even finish. The prices are GREAT and it's seasoned so amazing! I felt like I was on the islands. I would go back and take everyone in my family if I could I will definitely be returning my next trip to North Carolina. I loved it !\n",
      "Loved, Loved, Loved. It is a simple place, but you dont come to this place for the decor. You come for the damn good food. Please note* I am just a customer. There is no dicount for posting nor any compensation for this rating.\n",
      "Is a small restaurant food is good! Also the owners are very friendly they make sure u are satisfied!\n",
      "Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Meat is super soft and very tasty. Fried fish is delicious. Salsa is so yummy! Very friendly service.\n",
      "I would've like to take a before picture when it looked all nice and pretty, but it was so delicious I just couldn't wait. I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed\n",
      "We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again. Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.\n",
      "One of the few times I have given a business five stars. This restaurant has very good food everything on the menu is fresh and very very tasty. I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Las Vegas does not have a lot of good Mexican food unfortunately. So, when we do find one, it's always pretty exciting. This place was good. Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality. Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.\n",
      "Trying to curb my taco cravings, checked yelp for a taco spot not too far from the house, when I came across the review for Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and they have a perfect 5star rating. I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food\n",
      "My daughter and I stopped in yesterday and truly enjoyed our meal. So much so we added an order to go. Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure.\n",
      "The carnitas sopés are the best! Carne Asada tacos are in second place... I eat there at least twice a week, and it's fantastic every time!\n",
      "Talk about authentic Mexican food!! there i was in search of a new place to eat close to work. I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco. First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much. As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.\n",
      "I stop by here on my way to ed fountain park when my son has soccer games. I usually get tacos and tamales for the team and they love them more than pepes. Definitely a go to place for great Mexican food...cant wait to try other items.\n",
      "Very clean and friendly service. I had the Carne asada torta and my friend had tacos overall fairly good. For a quick bite not bad.\n",
      "I was surprised it was this good it was like a home cooked meal... I purchased one posole, 3 carne asada tacos, 5 fried fish tacos, a combination of carnitas, 1 chicken nugget plate, 2 orchatas and my total was $51 not bad at all.\n",
      "TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card payment I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in. I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.\n",
      "Their food is delicious!!! I got Huevos Rancheros and my bf got menudo. He loved it! The lady at the register was friendly and super nice! The coffee is really good too!!\n",
      "Great tacos de carne asada. I really liked the salsa. I added rice and bean and I am glad I did. Delicious and very affordable.\n",
      "Wonderful divey taco shop with awesome Mexican food. Highly recommend the tacos dorados, cheese enchiladas and chips with the salsa bar. The flavors are amazing! They must do most of their business as take out since it is so small, but the eating area is clean and nice. Don't be swayed by the strip mall. Definitely worth a stop.\n",
      "I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place. I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town. He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating. He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego. If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that. I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers. Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there. I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata). Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste. The cachete was tasty. My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss. Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole. The salsa was also fresh and tasty.\n",
      "THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN. Do not sleep on this spot, if you are ever in Vegas definitely stop by... I cant think of my favorite dish because you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; The menudo The cocteles, The enchiladas. Mm everything is bomb! and always great customer service and very clean nice little shop. Love it.\n",
      "Great place if you want some traditional fresh Mexican food ! The over ceviche which is one of my favorite dishes, to to be honest it's one of the best ones I had !\n",
      "They have tamarindo! My girlfriend and I have been looking for weeks and finally found our new go to spot! Thanks!\n",
      "Craving for authentic Mexican Food and feeling adventurous and out of your comfort zone. Gotta try this humble and family operated place. Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican food The cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!\n",
      "Man this place is bomb dot com - Let me tell you when it comes to Mexican good I'm picky there's so many spots here in vegas so when something really catches your taste buds then you know lol\n",
      "We were in Vegas for a few days and after eating at a number of the expensive resort offerings we found this little diamond in the rough. This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now. Go!\n",
      "Yes its definitely a five star hidden gem. A great pit stop on the way to Moab. Everything was fresh right down to the rice. A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back.\n",
      "I ordered carne asada, fish, & chicken tacos. Tacos are really small & over cooked. Was really disappointed, expected a lot based on the reviews I read. You're better off going to a taco truck. I really hate how over priced tacos are now. Wouldn't mind paying $2-3, but at least give me what I'm paying for.\n",
      "MI Pueblo is the BEST TACO SHOP IN VEGAS. The owners are so sweet and kind. Their food is absolutely delicious. I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL. YOU WONT FIND MANY CLOSE TO HOME, DOWN TO EARTH AND DELICIOUS PLACES LIKE THIS.\n",
      "I haven't eaten yet but if it tastes half as good as it smells I'll be happy. The staff was super friendly thumbs up!!\n",
      "By far the best burrito and salsa I have ever had. This place is way across town from where I live but i go there just to get my burritos, yes if I'm gonna go across town I better get two burritos to go.\n",
      "Legit food!! I had the chilaquiles with red sauce comes with eggs, beans and the best rice I've had in a long time.. Definitely recommend this spot. They know how it's done\n",
      "Came here while visiting my friend in Vegas. We wanted tacos and I'm picky about Mexican food. This place totally hit the mark. Not only was it delicious, the lady taking orders was super sweet and a really good salesperson. I was debating on getting carne asada fries because i had already had fast food that day. Here's how the convo went: Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day? Me: well, no... Her: then they're not so bad then Me: good point Salsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot. Yum.\n",
      "Once again. The good was hot and fresh tasty, the customer service is friendly and personal. This what to expect from a family owned restaurant. The burritos are very nice sized /over sized for your $$ the torta is good also, all the food is good sized portions\n",
      "This place is special. All their food is made with the care you would expect at a family gathering. The hospitality is incredible. This is NOT your typical Mexican turn-and-burn kind of place. Every dish I've ordered thus far has been absolutely fantastic...Well assembled and delicious. Personally, I love the \"caldo de pollo\" (chicken soup). I could eat it every day! This establishment is a definite winner in my book!!\n",
      "Best fish tacos! I also like the Carne Asada fries. The first time I had a chicken chile verde burrito. But once I tried the fish tacos, I was hooked! The other burritos are good, too. My husband loves the pickled/peppered veggies. He gets a bagful and eats them while we wait. Family owned and operated. Friendly, cheerful staff.\n",
      "The food is very tasty, generous portions. Had the combo with cheese enchilada, Carne Asada taco and chili rellenol with rice and beans. Hubs had the Carne Asada plate .\n",
      "I really enjoyed it here. The cheese enchiladas and carnitas taco were really good. The staff is very friendly, always nice to see positive happy people. I will be back for sure! give this place a try, you will enjoy it.\n",
      "I really liked the 'mom and pop' feel of this little Mexican restaurant, and the quality of the food was really good. Solid four stars. The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum. My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to. I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco! My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything! So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark.......\n",
      "This place is great! The food is amazing. Had a plate of chilaquiles and my wife had the machaca. The portions were generous and tasty. I highly recommend this place if you you in the area and want great Authentic Mexican Food!\n",
      "Outstanding. Visiting Las Vegas and happened upon this place. Having been raised in San Antonio, I feel like I know great Mexican food. And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge! The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them. When I'm back in vegas again, a meal here will be on my itinerary.\n",
      "Dont sleep on this spot! Consistently great, authentic mexican food. We've tried many other places but continue to return here!\n",
      "Seemed questionable from the outside especially only the outside thou when u walk in the atmosphere changes the cashier / sever name is Sarah she was really helpful I been here twice now I've tried the cabesa tacos, the lague tacos, fish tacos, the shrimp cocktail and the carnitas torta with fries all of it was outstanding I am surprised on how good it was they have a large variety of menu options which in sure there all good the cabesa was tender and juicy the torrilla they use was thin and delicious tasted home made fish taco was fresh it was fried still good thou love how fresh the tomatoes where , shrimp was perfect and Devined correctly had a good amount of avacodo too which I loved , the carnitas were tasteful and not overcooked lettuce was fresh and crunchy over all I would say they put a lot of love in there food which makes it super good new spot for my Mexican food cravings I highly recommend this place\n",
      "Amazing, fresh and inexpensive! First time here and I love it.\n",
      "Was in town on a short layover and was looking for some real deal Mexican! This place was so good! The sopes were amazing!!!!! Will definitely be back when in the area!\n",
      "Only 1 review?? C'mon! This place has awesome food!! It's rough around the edges but don't let it fool you. Tacos! Burritos! 3 different soups!\n",
      "Mi Pueblo Taco Shop is a family owned treasure in Las Vegas , Nevada. Owners Juanita and Manuel make homemade Mexican food in small batches and treat E everyone like family. It is outstanding. Paulette Motzko\n",
      "This place is great. I come here almost every day. Today I had a California burrito which was incredible. The fish tacos are always delicious. I really enjoy coming here, the staff is nice and it's always clean.\n",
      "Finally found the BEST Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas!! The food is not only fresh but comes in large quantities! Will come back again and will recommend this place to my family and friends!!\n",
      "Bomb! Fresh ingredients! Yummy to my tummy! I would highly recommend this gem. This meal hit the spot, next time I'll try the enchiladas.....\n",
      "I will say our expectations were guarded when we pulled up, but step inside and receive a warm greeting and look at the menu, you know all will be good, and it was. The burrito was tasty and plentiful, \"sandwich\" with the fried pork, Pastor tortas, absolutely satisfying, simple and perfect. The hot salsas were fun and tasty. Enjoy\n",
      "Small mom and pop joint. Food is really good here and service is great, super friendly and welcoming.\n",
      "Very good I recommend the fish tacos!!! And carne asada tacos! All with red salsa!! Bomb!!!\n",
      "Great selection of hockey stuff, jerseys and gift stuff. Pricey, but if you want hockey stuff, they have it. You enter here upon existing the Hockley Hall of Fame, or you can enter from the indoor mall. Food and drink are just outside if you are exhausted and thirsty.\n",
      "The Spirit of Hockey is technically the gift-shop for the Hockey Hall of Fame but you can still enter from the main entrance even if you don't want to go through the museum (even though you definitely should!) This store is pretty much exactly as you'd expect: wall-to-wall memorabilia of all your favourite NHL teams. While I was mystified at first, it quickly wore off. It kind of became of game of laughing at all the ridiculous things you can stick a logo on (would you like some novelty cups to go with your keychain??) However, the fact of the matter is that people do buy them so obviously there is a market for these things. I actually saw someone at the airport on his way out of Toronto carrying a giant Washington Capitals \"Man Cave\" sign that they had purchased at the store. I didn't exactly walk out empty-handed either (because who doesn't need a Harvey the Hound figure to sit on their desk??) All of that being said, the store is well laid out and staffed by friendly, helpful employees, all of whom are enthusiastic to talk about hockey (or at least good at faking it!)\n",
      "It is not really fair for me to write a review of The Spirit of Hockey. I do enjoy watching hockey.. but really not into buying any memorabilia or some cheap overpriced keepsake just because there is a NHL's team logo on it. Anyway, if you have a friend that into that... and he/she might enjoy something from here... But if you are from out of town hockey fan visiting, you will be really impressed to see all these hockey related merchandise all under one roof! Now go spend your money!! :)\n",
      "Ich fand es sehr schön Gute kostüme Gute Besetzung Ein bisschen hat beim Bühnenbild gefehlt im Vergleich zu König der Löwen aber die haben ja auch ihr eigenes festes Theater Tolle Musik Tolle Stimmung\n",
      "Mir ht das Musica sehr gut gefallen. In den vorderen Reihen tanzte der Affe...soll heißen die Darsteller bewegten sich auch im Publikum. Beeindruckend auch, wie sie durch den Zuschauerraum schwingen. Es ist ein Musical von dem ich behaupten möchte hat sich gelohnt dafür nach Stuttgart zu fahren. Auch die Plätze im Theater sind gut ausgerichtet, so dass man auch in den hinteren Reihen gut sehen kann.\n",
      "Ich war nicht in Stuttgart im Theater sondern damals in Hamburg. Aber es war einfach ein Mega geiles Erlebnis und für mich eines der schönsten Musicals. Bühnenbild, Darsteller und die Musik einfach nur klasse und empfehlenswert.\n",
      "Love the place. Been going for years. The coffee is really good too. I always get the special meal and my wife the dosa. Both are great.\n",
      "Great place to enjoy South Indian food Thali was good along with mini tiffin Pretty busy on weekends Don't forget to try the coffee ( served in traditional stainless steel utensils) Washroom pretty clean\n",
      "We went during Thanksgiving weekend and realized they only had a buffet for $14-15/person. The dosas were brought fresh to your table. Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking \"washed urad dhal\" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love). Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay. Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle. I liked the hoppers dish.\n",
      "The food was quite good but the service could be better. We went there 1/2 hour before closing and were rushed to order and our food wasn't even hot. They wouldn't provide refills to the \"sambhar & chutney\" as the kitchen was closed!!\n",
      "I used to love their ala carte menu...now they have all day buffet very bad and stale food.....avoid at any cost....we can't even order ala carte. ....\n",
      "I'm really not sure why this place gets such bad reviews - maybe the quality of the food has gone down over the years, or maybe people are comparing it to some of the more fancy/expensive dosa places in the area. I thought the Chana Bhatura & the Dosa that I ordered were delicious and I'm a complete sucker for Sambar. For the price and the quick service, I thought it was a great alternative to some of the other choices in the area.\n",
      "I have been to the Scarborough location and had a decent experience. I took my family here (12 people) after calling ahead and being ensured that there would be minimum wait time. When we reached here the line was out of the door but we were told it wouldn't take long. After 45 mins(!!!) of waiting we finally got a place to sit. We were happily looking forward to some tasty masala dosas. Well that's the first thing your order at a Dosa place right? Well guess what, they ran out of potatoes.... You can have a palak paneer dosa sir, our server said. Well I didn't come here and wait 45 mins to eat a palak paneer dosa. We walked and instead of having a nice time at dinner, we ate greasy Domino's pizza instead. Interestingly upon further investigation, I discovered some older reviews with the same experience. I wish I had read them before. At this point I don't want to set foot in at least this location of Saravana Bhavan. I might consider giving the Scarborough location another shot. With so many options around, please do yourself a favor and go to some other South Indian place in Mississauga where they don't run out of potatoes....\n",
      "I am a big Saravana Bhavan fan. Back home in India as well as here. new to Mississauga. food is good. enjoy the buffet specially. Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too. samabr vada is another favourite. I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there. I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology. well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing. D James, Etobicoke\n",
      "EDIT: I tried this place again almost after 2 years and it seems to have improved quite a bit. Possibly because of the new management. The food is much better now and we visit this place a couple of times a month and are pleasantly surprised with the changes. 2014 Review: I'm really disappointed with the degrading quality of food and service at this place. I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here. The place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that \"This is how it is\" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress. We were appalled at the quality of service here and vowed never to come back here again and recommend people from going here ever. If you'd like to get good South Indian food in Mississauga, goto either Udupi Madras Cafe or Chutney Swamy or Guru Lakshmi.\n",
      "Been in to eat and also have picked up takeout. Great menu, fair prices. Food was solid. I will return.\n",
      "Terrible service - they can't handle pressure Food served cold. Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!? And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys. We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all. Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!? When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times. Not served!!! They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave. This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more. This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening. With this sort of customer service I seriously wonder why the place is busy or popular. If I could I would give them negative marks. One things for sure., they've lost an avid foodie customer.\n",
      "This place has lost my vote completely .... Used to be an awesome South Indian buffet for breakfast with hot kaapi served with idli dosa and wada and a background music of suprabhatam to augment your weekend into a bliss... But off late the service is unbearable... I used to go as the food was atleast better than the others... Today the food also was a huge let down! Sambhar with no sambhar aroma just daal with tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds and idli, dosa, wada all undercooked and stone like texture and not to mention cold ..... And a background music of titanic? Really? This has to be a management issue.. Even the rava upma was disastrous ... The table was not even served water! I would just like to add is this restaurant was special to me and I used to come here very often... This is a yelp alert to other people to avoid this place and not to get their heart broken like me! If you are still thinking to try this place let me tell you they don't have gulab jun the only star entry of this place and have some cheap kesari... Thank you for not going and trying out Cora's adjacent to this shit\n",
      "Absolutely love the food! Brought many people here for lunch and dinner and they also love the food. I highly recommend masala dosa and gun powder idlys.\n",
      "Had heard so much about Saravanna Bhavan- we just moved here from California and was excited to give this place a try. The service was non-existant...it was as if they were doing us a favour by serving us lunch. The supposedly spicy 'kara' dosa was tasteless and the potato stuffing inside was a violent red colour- using red food colour does not make anything spicy people! My friend ordered another dosa which was so greasy that it had no taste but stale oil. The thali looked OK but tasted zilch. The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty. When we complained the server mumbled something and then never showed his face. Never going back here again\n",
      "How many of you are aware that you get charged 10% gratuity on your bill plus 13% HST on the tip amount? I am not aware that this automatic gratuity mentioned in the menu card. Can someone advise if this is legal? Anyway I think it is a dishonest practice. I am really disappointed.\n",
      "So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again: 1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! 2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok) 3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. 4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? 5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) 6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience. Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.\n",
      "#SOUTHINDIANFOOD #SARAVANAABHAVAN #YELPGTA I've been to Saravanaa Bhavan multiple times, a couple of years ago. It never was my \"go to\" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick. My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli. It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular. Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time.\n",
      "Dosa is sometimes seen as a delicacy. Most do not make this at home. So when looking for a dosa fix, and a proper one, I have tried to come here. I came here about 3 times this year. The service is minimal. You get your food, which comes in small portions, and you get out. You pay at the counter at the front. So that kind of tells you what type of set up this is. Zero ambiance. hard cold seats, storefront setting, in a plaza. Walls peeling. It is all veg food - no meat. The dosa was barely filled. I mean, barely. I would say two tablespoons of filling in the large paper dosa. I would rather go to Annjapar a bit further south.\n",
      "This Saravanaa is not as well run as the one in Scarborough. The food is not that good. The dosa was cold & okay. The sambar tasted like spicy north Indian dal! I am surprised since I was under the impression that this Saravanaa in Mississauga will be better than the one in Scarborough.\n",
      "Three stars for the absolutely amazing delicious food. They lose two stars from me because their service is HORRIBLE. Not only are they EXTREMELY slow, they don't actually care about it. They forgot half of our meal about 20 minutes after the first part was brought to the table they \"remembered\" one dish was completely forgotten about, had to ask (the girl who was sitting on her phone in the corner) to please it to us. We couldn't even get them to bring the bill after asking twice. If you don't mind waiting or being ignored. At least the food is very good.\n",
      "Ultimate south indian breakfast buffet! Totally satisfied with this place. The staff is friendly,the food is fresh, Dosas are crisp, chutneys are delicious and sambar is to die for! If you're planning to catch up the weekend buffet and don't want to wait then be there by 10.30 a.m.\n",
      "Good value for food however I have always had an issue with their cleanliness. Overall not super clean but ok. Food quality is ok. Overall value 5/10\n",
      "again - as usual - it's amazing!!\n",
      "It seems that a lot of reviewers have already shared their strong feelings on the flavor (or the lack thereof) of Saravanaa Bhavan. To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that \"I've experienced better\" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh. I didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome.\n",
      "5 stars if you eat at a saravana bhavan in Chennai,India, but not here. They are not able to create the same magic here.\n",
      "Excellent for vegetarians and healthy food. Variety of dishes. If you want taste something different this is the place to go.\n",
      "On the name of Chennai's Saravana Bhawan we visited here three to four times but not good as other branches are. Last time visited Delhi's Saravana Bhawan and it was really good. We can't even compare this Saravana to Delhi's Saravana. I didn't liked there sambar and dosa was not crispy at all even filter coffee was like Tim Hortons! Also the thali is limited... Can you imagine?!? For the first time I experienced this kind of thing... We just needed 1 extra poori and for that only we had to pay. We visited Bahrain's Saravana also... Even that branch is also far better than this one!\n",
      "I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since. I decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily. So I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi.\n",
      "Been here a couple of times and it was ok for most part. Not spectacular. The food has been ok, but we've always had good service. Returned last week with baby in tow, only to find no changing table in bathroom of this \"family\" friendly restaurant. Not returning.\n",
      "For my money, Saravana Bhavan is just perfect. food for a great price. Crispy, smooth dosas and bubbly, chewy uttapam. The Sambar is just like Dosa in SF, packed full of leaves, seeds, and spices that hit your taste buds in all the right places! The staff are super nice and kept making sure we were satisfied. \"More sambar, More Chutney?\" Yes, please! After getting way more than 2 people could eat (come in groups) we packed it up and of course left with more sambar and more chutney. Sat and Sun, the buffet offers all the south indian food you could eat, (AYCE) and desserts. Try just a bite of these super sugary, fried desserts and think about jogging back to downtown TO.\n",
      "Been to this location thrice at different times. The service has been pretty consistent - quick and efficient. I will not expect more from an Indian restaurant. The food has been really good for the most part. Here are the things we've tried - The vada sambar is top-class; fresh, hot, soft and super tasty. The bisibele bath is good with plenty of good flavour. The onion rava masala dosa is crisp and filling - the best I've had. One star off for the rava idli that lacked life... Otherwise you cannot go wrong with anything here!\n",
      "This is going to be a biased review because this chain is from my home city in South India. Now that's out of the way, this is the best place to get authentic south indian food. If you are a newbie to the cuisine go on Sunday for the buffet when you can try a bit of everything If you familiar with South Indian food, the mini Idlis, paper masala and the adai aviyal are something that you can always bet will be great. It's a completely vegetarian joint, so meat eaters might be tad disappointed - the flavour will make up for it, trust me ;) Enjoy.\n",
      "The idlis are so good! The service is wonderful. Rava kesari is the best. Cheese Kara Masala Dosa is also a must try. The quality of food and the speed at which its served is amazing.\n",
      "This place is always busy. We went for family day lunch. We waited for 10 mins after which we were shown our way to a table. After siting for 15mins (and waiting for the menu) we were \"informed\" that they only have all day buffet that day. The dosas were served fresh and piping hot and aloo masala was a favourite at our table. The rest of the food was average; uttapa, Idli and medu vadas were all cold. For dessert they had gulab jamun (avoidable) and rava kesari (yum). In all a good place for South Indian food. The dosa and the rava kesari are a must have.\n",
      "I really love this place. The paper dosa is so crispy! The potato masala is very mild and the chutneys have varying degrees of spicyness. We also love their Rava Kichadi, Parotta's with potatoes and a delicious cauliflower dish. The Mini Tiffin is a great place to start and try a bit of everything. And don't forget to have some Rasmalai for dessert! Enchanting! The Rava Kesari is also delicious.\n",
      "I love the manager here, he knows us for a very long time. I like their food. The servers change so often that we don't like it but still they are much better than a lot of other restaurants. Food - 4/5 Service - 4.5/5 Management - 5/5\n",
      "I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall. Most tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals. We ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down. The onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam. The saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all. I am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food.\n",
      "Disappointed ! They don't seem to function to the level they built up their restaurants in Chennai. They don't have a clue about the importance of ambience in a restaurant . Sacha\n",
      "This is the worst place to have South Indian food whatsoever. I am a South Indian myself and wanted to take one of my colleagues to try south indian food. Initially I thought of Guru Lakshmi but then I decided this place as Guru Lakshmi tends to get way busy. I have tried Saravanaa Bhavan in Dubai and this place comes nowhere close to it. I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive. But guess what, the server plainly refused. I didn't want to create a scene in front of my colleague. Finally the dosa arrived and guess what again, it had hair on it. Yes the dosa that I wanted my colleague who never tried south indian food in his life, was trying it for the first time and the dosa had HAIR on it !!! At this point I was going to almost lose it. But I kept my calm and requested it to be changed and hoped that there would be no cockroach. Totally ruined my experience and I'm sure my colleagues as well. Please folks go anywhere to try south indian food but not here. For the same price you will get better south indian cuisine with NO HAIR in it !\n",
      "I tired their Special Thali today ( only thali on the menu ) and it was fantastic, it was a gloomy day and it was just pefect, 14 items all veggie, it took about 10 minutes to get my order ready, that is kind of odd I would say as they were not busy all all when I entered, that being said it was worth it..the food you could just tell was fresh and clean. They also renovated, the place looks way better than before, they added some booths as well . so if you are in the mood for some spicy south indian cusine, give this place a try. Please note: If you are trying south indian food for the first time, it is pretty spicy :) thanks for reading PS. the service is a bit odd but not rude. so dont be surpised if you find your server to be a little odd :)\n",
      "went there for dinner last night. Service was average. Food was horrible. Sambar and Chutney tasted bland. Dosa was tasteless. Won't be visiting them soon.\n",
      "Saravanaa has gone on a steep downhill trajectory over the past few years in food quality and service. The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. But ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily. My dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? And it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait. The waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us \"the air conditioning was not working\". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. This restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations. My mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that. PROS: - nice ambiance, comfortable booths - delicious, spicy sambar CONS: - oily dosas with virtually no filling - crowded early, stays that way through dinner - NOT good for groups (call ahead) - hasty servers who do not consider the weather - miniature food\n",
      "Great Masala Dosa - the mustard seed flavour of the Masala is perfect. The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result. I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much.\n",
      "We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. We decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. The breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30. The first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. One of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. We asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. For two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. I have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. Final verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee Disliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. Won't return.\n",
      "Love the dosas here. The size of a dosa is smaller here but it is also cheaper. A great bang for your buck. Service is prompt and staff is friendly. The restaurant is usually packed and is also quite spacious\n",
      "Somehow after we moved to Mississauga this Sarvana Bhawan was just a block from our new place so obviously we had to check it out. Come from Madras (the birth place of this chain) I would say it's the same flavour and taste as back home. It doesn't mean that's it's a great place to eat out south Indian food around here. There are better options for sure. But if you are looking for good old Sarvana Bhawan taste this one pretty much nails it bang on.\n",
      "Best south indian food in Toronto. Everything freshly prepared and I am surprised at all the negative reviews posted by some members. The service was slow but maybe due to the large number of people.\n",
      "Awesome authentic food and well priced Can be quite busy over the weekends Service can be slow, but the food more than makes up for it\n",
      "New Management is crapy. Quality of food very low. Used to a big fan of this restaurant but will not recommend it to anybody. Please dont eat there.\n",
      "This place serves the pure vegetarian south Indian cuisine .. even though I am not a pure vegetarian, I do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when I am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so I guess I can go here once in a while .. The ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and I hate sitting in this area. The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess. Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for. Their spice level is pretty low.\n",
      "The food here makes me forget that I'm not eating meat. I'm a carnavore and make few eceptions about not having some meat on my plate, but I have to say I don't even miss it when I eat here. My wife and I have only ever gone for the buffet. I eat my vada with sambar, my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand. It's always so busy that the service is close to chaos. But I'd much rather have great food and slow service than great service and terrible food. I recommend this place to any meat lover like myself to prove that the occasional meat free meal can be very enjoyable.\n",
      "This was THE SHITTIEST first-dosa-tasting of my life. I know it's impossible to rate my first-tasting of anything, but I'm pretty sure when you get a sour stomach and horrible shits after being at a restaurant - it was a horrible first experience. I really hope dosas don't actually taste like what they did here. The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that. The service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy. The only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go. That's the one thing they didn't manage to screw up royally. And paying $30 for all this, that was the rotting cherry on top.\n",
      "The place for Dosa, in my books! This place has always provided the crowds with some great vegetarian food as well as my favourite, dosas! I am not much of a vegetarian, but i would go here for Dosas as well as other tasty dishes. The service is good, not the best, but still good. The place is clean, and has the sink to wash your hands, without going to the washrooms...a must for your seasoned foodie.\n",
      "This is a poor version of this esteemed franchise. Sambhaar lacked any tamarind and looked and tasted like daal. Chutneys were also subpar. The dosa was strictly ok. The Scarborough branch is much better. Very disappointed.\n",
      "I love a good fixin' of dosa every now and then. When I do have it, I always go in with expectations (which I'm working on) of the dosa rice crepe itself having to be crispy, the potato filling has to be spicy and spread evenly inside the dosa crepe. Craving dosa, I went to Udupai first (one of my favorite dosa restaurants) but they were closed on a Tuesday for lunch! Hence, I ended up coming to Saravanaa Bhavan due to proximity & time crunch. I guess it was a good excuse to try it out. Here's what I found at Saravanna Bhavan: -Mom and I ordered 2 Spicy Kara Dosas. We found them to be rather soggy and oily -The potato filling was blood red in color, making me think they had added in a ton of food coloring -The dosa crepe was overly thick -Chutney's were okay; however they really skimped on it. I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate) -The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in -As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow. Sure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa. Unfortunately, food and price do not go hand-in-hand here.\n",
      "I have been to Sarvana Bhavan a zillion times, okay probably not zillion but you get what I mean :) if you are a true south indian food loyalist you will like the food. It offers good south indian food without the bells and whistles like Chinese hakka Masala dosa or the likes!! The food is very true to its roots and the chutneys and curries are cooked in chennai - tamilian styles. The place recently was revamped and is more organized and looks much neater. The servers are polite and the food is delivered without a very long wait time. I ordered the thali and it was very very delicious !\n",
      "Loved the Delhi Sarvanna Bhavan so was here to give this place a try.. not sure if buffet time was worse time to try the food but my rating is for the buffet food. Ambience: 4/5 (on any other day would have given 5/5, only issue it's a little small place to have a buffet) Service: n/a since it was a buffet I wouldn't rate the service coz there were a lot of people and food delays were natural Quality: 2.5/5 (food was average, not what I had expected and in comparison to what I have had) Quantity:5/5(since it was buffet) Overall, it was a 3/5 for me, deserts were too sweet food was cold. I will definitely give them a try but not on a buffet day\n",
      "Average! They could do so much better. No exceptional flat ours. Poor is were way too small. Only redeeming feature was the pappadums. Service is attentive but we have had much better South Indian.\n",
      "I went here to have authentic south Indian food, however I was very disappointed. Also the quality of food is low compared to their Scarborough location. If you are looking for authentic South Indian food, I would not recommend this place.\n",
      "I love this place. The dosas are really good and portions are big. The place is very clean and service is the best I've had at an Indian restaurant. The waiters treat you like your at their home. Whenever I'm in town, I go here.\n",
      "Worth a 3.5 star rating. We tried the Rasam soup, Masala Dosa and Tomato & Onion Utthappam. It was all quite flavourful, though I found the soup to be a little too spicy. The mango lassi was quite nice and cooling after the soup. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night, but tables come available quickly and service is quick. The furniture is a strange mix of marble style tables and old library chairs. The floor was a little messy with bits of food, but otherwise the restaurant was clean. It's an interesting place; we'll be back to try some other options.\n",
      "It's been a while since i have been to sarvana bhavan and boy had i been missing out. I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately. Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right. Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried. Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too.\n",
      "Overall: Worth the trek to Mississauga. Great value, great taste, great people. Room: Not fancy, spacious, clean Service: Friendly, even avuncular (more materteral), everyone's an auntie, and frankly a bit concerned that i wanted a second coffee Menu: Thorough south indian menu, tough to decipher without guidance from someone who knows the cuisine Presentation: Traditional south indian restaurant, paper dosas are intimidatingly big but that's why you get them Taste: Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness. Value: There's a reason this place is packed with Indians. Tastes good and cheap!\n",
      "Love the food.. We order thali last time, my god there was so much to eat.. Every bit of dish tastes heavenly..\n",
      "My mom took me here today. I've had random dosas here and there but am not much of an expert. Per my mom, the portions were excellent, the sauces/dips tasted good and were plentiful, and the dosa itself was very good. I thought it tasted quite yummy but spicy (my mom says that's the point!), and was fairly filling. Around $8 for a masala dosa, which like I said is a good sized meal. Service was very prompt, and the lady serving us seemed pleasant. The restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime. You order at your table but pay at the counter.\n",
      "Came here last Saturday with my dad for some dosa. We were pleasantly surprised with the texture of breads, dosa and the complex flavours of the bateta and chutneys. The masala tea was also very good. The channa could use a little bit of work though. I'll be back.\n",
      "Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe their service! Worst part is the management though. This isn't the first time this has happened looking at other reviews. If there was a way this would be getting a 0 star!!!\n",
      "Just had a great meal at the newly renovated restaurant. Dark wood and comfortable banquets. The food was excellent as always. Idli were fluffy and the vada were nice and crispy. The cauliflower gravy that comes with paratha was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant. The best South Indian in the GTA!\n",
      "Delicious inexpensive South Indian food. I had the cauliflower dosa, not often available. Accompanied by sambar and 3 chutneys it was delectably filling for only $8. The new renovation has made dining in very pleasant. If you're a fan of South Indian, don't miss it.\n",
      "Check your bill! The restaurant adds 10% gratuity without clear disclosure. I added a 20% tip on top. In effect, I paid 30+% for service. And, adding insult to injury, this happened to be at the weeekend brunch buffet with minimal table service. The non-disclosure is deceitful.\n",
      "Reasonably good food but again the downside with this place, just like most other Indian restaurants is the service. The servers are unsmiling but not as bad as in most other Indian places. Depending on the time of the day, be prepared to endure some heavily irritating and ill mannered crowd. The food is however quite delicious and very fresh. For this reason I will keep on going back.\n",
      "Poor service. Watered down sambhar! Cold idly and poori!! I have been coming here for past 2 years. There was never once when I had received good service. The server working there seems like he hates his job. He's been working there for as long as I dined there. The dosa is average. However! The idly and poori always arrives at our table cold. The poori is so hard that it's barely edible. 50 % of the times, you will get good sambhar. But 50 % of the times you will get sambhar that is watered down and looks like water too. I really hope they improve their service and food. Don't serve the stale and hard poori to your customers!\n",
      "I will never return to this place! They made us wait for 20 minutes even though there were rows of empty tables. Then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and I had to ask to be served. We had a pretty simple order-2 people, 4 items. They managed to mess it up. Food took forever to come and one item was missing. When I asked for the item the wait staff denied I had ordered it-their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. The manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' Um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. What are you doing if you can't handle the customers? And to boot-they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill. The food was mediocre. Stay far far away from this place. I'm sure there are better places for a dosa craving.\n",
      "We went to this location during the dinner hour. The service was good and the servers are friendly. We ordered a dosa and I went with South Indian thali as its very different than Punjabi thali. The food was average and good for the price and quantity point of view. The only thing which threw away the stars was; while were eating the dosa, at the end we found a rubber band piece in the potato masala. I told the owner when I went to pay and he was very apologetic and stated we should have told him earlier and he would have made another one for us.\n",
      "I have been here thrice...not because I am a fan...but because this place serves decent south Indian food... Fellow yelpers who have ever tried at their outlet in Connaught Place, New Delhi...will call it below average but you can't expect same standard everywhere! Can you? Service Wise: It's slow and when the restaurant is busy...expect slower service. I went here on this Ugadi. It was packed and they forgot my order. Two gentlemen on my table finished their thali and I got my tomato uttapam when they were done. They have good servers...warm and soft spoken...but expect slow service! Food: Decent/ Average/ OK..Thalis are ok...so it the idli/wada combo and Uttapams. Its not at all an expensive place Ambiance: Please don't expect much\n",
      "We went here on Saturday evening and I wanted to order Kara dosa which they did not have. We ordered mix veg dosa and tomato onion uttapam and requested they make it in ghee which they refused.We had previously come here and they had made our dosas in ghee.The sambhar was cold and when we asked for another one that was cold too.Worst sarvanna bhavan in the world.I have been to Dubai and London locations which are much better than here and have more variety of dosas.\n",
      "Went for Saturday dinner with 4 ppl. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Extremely clean!!! Love the hand washing station!!! Great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons: (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes. We ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees. One entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came. It wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol. This is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you :)\n",
      "Consistent good quality, flavors and fast service. My favorite South Indian food option in GTA.\n",
      "Tasty food , nice clean place . prices little bit high for dosas but similar to some others in the area. Try some of the specialty dosas.\n",
      "Great place if you want to taste real South Indian food. Great customer service. The food was tasty, specially their Special Meal with different curries and rice. So far I have had very experience with this place after several visits.\n",
      "I've been to both the Scarborough and Mississauga locations and I prefer the Mississauga one because of cleanliness and also they have washroom and hand-washing area tucked away in the corner. This time I ordered the paper dosa, sweet lassi and the special madras coffee. The dosa and lassi were great. The coffee was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked that fact that it wasn't strong (they can make it strong if you want it that way) and I asked for sugar on the side. It comes in a cute little stainless cup in a small bowl and it has a lot of froth on top. All in all a tasty meal. At the end (where the cashier sits) I had some of the saunf (fennel) with candy...its good for digestion and its nice to eat something sweet (and free) at the end of the meal.\n",
      "Saravana Bhawan has regained its touch after the last review though the Manager can certainly work on his attitude.\n",
      "Today I went to sarvana bhava with my family at scarborough location this is one of the worst sevice I got I went with my infant baby (I had requested a seat in corner for my baby but the waiter was very rude he was more interested in accommodating other guest though place was relatively empty) and the service was pathetic. waited half an hour for tandoori paratha after finishing fist one and which never cameI wont recommend this place for anyone\n",
      "It's inside the mall and the food is awesome! Probably the best authentic Chinese dinner you can have on Christmas Eve in North Carolina. Just don't peek in the kitchen. You're all good.\n",
      "A diamond in the rough... I get off the highway just to grab lunch from here. Remind me of the authentic Chinese take outs in NYC\n",
      "It helps to have someone understand the language while in the Hong Kong BBQ, but they do have english menus that you can use on the counter. It is pretty cheap for some good food. Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours. Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them. Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good.\n",
      "This is as authentic as you're going to get. I'll be straight up when I say that places like this can make me nervous. The mall itself is sketchy...and it's in a sketchy part of town. I make it this way every few weeks for some bánh mì at Le's, but came on a day that Le's was closed. Dim sum?...or the place with ducks hanging in the window? We opted for the ducks in the window and chose Hong Kong BBQ. When you enter Hong Kong BBQ...you can tell there's going to be a communication issue. There is literally...not a single thing resembling \"American\" in this restaurant. I knew I was going to like this place. I did my best not to look back at the kitchen. We all know what that is going to look like...and I'd rather play dumb. Dangit! I looked. The service was quick and the food was great! We were even entertained with Chinese soccer on their small TV. I'd recommend coming here if you're an adventurous person...otherwise...you'll never make it as far as the door...much less the table.\n",
      "Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte.\n",
      "Missing Hong Kong BBQ... found this on Yelp and was excited to try it. But, the BBQ pork was extremely dry... was disappointed. However, the service was good and they had the ginger/green onion sauce which is a plus as most places either wouldn't have it or would charge you extra for it.\n",
      "This is definitely a hole in the wall place. I was actually picking up banh mi sandwiches and saw this place. The duck and pork were prepared as well as the places I go to in ATL. I will definitely be stopping by this place again when I'm in the area.\n",
      "I took my 2011 Q5 in for a LOF (Lube, oil and filter). Went to pick up the car and was told it was $250 for the invoice, including a $72 charge to reset the service light which was not quoted. BTW this is like a 5 minute procedure that they charge you 30 minutes to do. I'll never go back there. I went to Midtown Audi in Agincourt previously and had excellent service. I didn't go back there because it takes weeks to get an appointment. I was able to get into this dump the same day, now I know why!!! Avoid this place!!!!!\n",
      "The worst service dept experience. The two people i dealt with were defensive dismissive and rude when posed simple questions. Especially on cost of items,In this case tires. There was a price difference of over two hundred dollars between tires and install between downtown and audi dealers north of city. This was a second chance for audi downtown for me because of a previous visit that went bad and the manager called to apologize then and said give us a chance so we will make it right. Sorry i will never go there again.\n",
      "If you need to buy a car, call Edit Omar! There are so many sales people out there that don't listen to what you want. And I'm in sales! Edit took the time to go through all the features, specs and pricing. She even clued into the fact that it was me buying the car and handed me the keys for the test drive. (so many car salesmen just talk to the husband...hello, the car is for me..) She even stayed late so I could pick up my car the day it was ready. ** note - the next guy up the food chain will try and sell you the Audi Care Package. Worth getting, but as I said before he was again speaking to the wrong purchaser, so I opted to buy it from Edit the next day. ;)\n",
      "They are quick to overcharge you and collect your money but crap on customer service. I would expect more from a dealership that represents such a great brand. Paid just over $1000 for my yearly service. They called me to ask if I could come back to collect some touch up pens. I refused to battle traffic so they sent it with their shuttle driver. My accountant needed the invoice for the original purchase of the car. Spoke with Chloe on a Monday who said she would send it via email. Waited one day-no invoice. After 4 phone calls with multiple messages, I had to be insistent that something so simple be escalated to the attention of the manager. If they can't handle something so simple, I don't know how they handle the intricacies of fixing European car. Worries me a bit. I was also told that they would have to go onto their stock room to find invoice. That could've been communicated in a professional way well before the fourth phone call. Not respectful that people are busy. I would avoid and go to another dealership.\n",
      "After another problem with our Audi - this time a mal - function of the key in the ignition. I called and was told the battery for the key would need to be recharged a ten minute job I was told. As I drove in there were two service reps and 5 clients all waiting in line. So the ten minutes came and went and eventually the assistant manager asked me what the problem was I explained he checked the key and said they needed to order a part but the car was safe to drive. Half an hour later my husband gets a call to say the part is in and they can fix the problem tomorrow. He calls back three times to eventually get someone live who insists there is no record of me going to the garage or of anyone calling my husband so \"We must be mistaken\"!!! Finally I have had it call back and ask for the service dept someone live and no v/mail - the girl on reception asks me over and over is it for an appointment or do they have my car in already. I reply neither - she asks the questions again this time no so politely I tell her to just put me through she then cuts me off. So I call back and thank goodness get \"Sarah\" who I always dealt with until her mat leave. I tell her the problem she is gone for two seconds and comes back to tell me the car needs to be with them tomorrow as they have the part. So my recommendation is do not deal with any of the brainless reps there - deal with Sarah she is polite -super efficent and gets results...........................Still battling over wether we will get a courtesy car which is part of our lease agreement with Audi but they always seem to fail at!!\n",
      "This place is horrible with the worst service ever! The sales reps were very attentive when I came in to buy my car. After that, every time I came in for service was a nightmare. I made an appointment for service just this afternoon, and I came in at 2 pm, then I've been waiting for more than 2 hours for the service to be completed! I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home, but they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like \" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do\". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back.\n",
      "This Audi Downtown just opened a few weeks ago with a large showroom but horrible service. I made an appointment for service last week and waited 30 minutes in line for the attendant to process the paper. Because they couldn't repair a tailight bulb last week, I had to return today to repair the matter. There were 2 customers ahead of me when I arrived at the appointed 9:30am, the same service personnel was handling matters. Get this: it took 35 minutes for the guy to serve these 2 customers and he wasn't even done (he was supposed to simply take their keys, note the issues, print an order sheet). He was wasting time chatting with one customer about the pros and cons of PC Windows when there are customers waiting. He didn't even acknowledge my existence or simply inform me to wait. Giving up, I placed my car keys on his desk and spoke with WIlliam Yip, the manager, who said he would handle it. The facilities are nice but extremely short staffed and the guys at service do not know how to prioritise or customer service!\n",
      "Just bought a new A4 from Keif Grey. What a great atmosphere at the dealership, no pressure from Keif or Alexandra in finance and everyone else was very friendly also. Buying a car can be very intimidating and they took all that away. Robin the sales manager also helped make my decision easy. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used Audi. Thank you.\n",
      "I liked the service when I purchased my car as sales rep was patient and knowledgable. I got a good deal on my car, and he even gave me winter mats. But when you're bringing your car in for maintenance or repairs, you won't get the same kind of service. Things rarely get fixed and you will be told everything is working as intended if you complain about abnormal behaviours. I once took my car in for alignment, and the car still didn't drive straight! Then I was told it's due to angle of the pavement. I can't wait to get ouf the lease and dump this dealer for good! I love audis, but I will take my business to Markham dealer.\n",
      "The most professional, organized, and attentive Audi dealership I have stepped foot in. Great showroom and awesome downtown location. Great for test drives. Low pressure customer oriented approach\n",
      "service was ok when buying a new car, but follow-up service after the sales guy has made the commission is non existent. i would buy again since I live in the area and love Audi's but not from the same sales rep, don't rmbr his name but he is the first desk on the right when you enter\n",
      "This dealership has the worst serve department I have ever dealt with. Their service advisors are defensive, they avoid necessary repairs and don't listen to or follow-up on problems. I had so many issues I had to contact Audi Canada to get them to intervene. Finally I got the needed repair but when I went in for it I was faced with the same problems, lack of advisors so it delayed the process of registering the vehicle for service, and there was no apology for all of the delays. This deanship continues to do damage to the Audi brand. I wonder if Audi Canada will ever step in.\n",
      "These guys are a disgrace. Have no clue about customer service at all and treat people like garbage. Without getting into a long story I've had an issue with my brand new car that I just got in April that they insist is working. Ignored me completely for the past 2 months. Workday return my call. They have now refused to even service my car there. WOW! I wouldn't give them a cent of my money if I were you. I now have the media after them. No one needs to buy a new car and go through all this b*******. Stay far away from this place. DISGUSTING!\n",
      "The food truck is a welcoming asset for a guest from out of town. The food truck is named fire*and*foraged and is amazing. The beer is also amazing. In my book this nanobrewery/food truck combo is definitely a double dividend!! The dark beers on nitro rock on the flavor profile!!\n",
      "Just went here for lunch and it was really wonderful. We had the burger from Fire and Forage and the B.L.A.T.. Both REALLY good. Great atmosphere too\n",
      "First time in Phoenix and went to Shop Beer Co on recommendation. Great outdoor space. Cooled by misters and comfortable even when outside temps are 100+. Great craft beer that is all brewed in house. Great food truck out back that rotates. Come by and check out if in Phoenix area.\n",
      "The Shop has pretty good beer and I like the fact that they have a few guest brews too. The outdoor area is great and having a food truck on hand is always a nice touch in case you imbibe a little too much. If you're looking for a day drinking spot, look no further. This place is ideal.\n",
      "Great selections of beer. You can get a crowler there and the food is mighty fine. I'll be back.\n",
      "First timer. My wife heard about this place at the dentist in east Mesa this morning. It's tucked away in Tempe off Rio Salado. Great selection of craft beers, my first brew was The Nines. Great Red Ale, very smooth even though it's IBU was 90. My wife had the Coffee Brown Nitro which was awesome. What a find after a root canal!\n",
      "This place is amazing. I tried the nines, coffee brown nitro, and (480) session pale ale. All are the perfect beer for whatever your feeling that night. I made the mistake of grabbing food before heading over, the food truck looked legit. 5 stars. You need to come here if you're in Tempe.\n"

      "First and foremost, I seriously love this place! First look: The whole place has a very cool, very inviting vibe. The decor (industrial, rustic wood mixed with some seriously cool and unique art) hangout areas (sweet beer garden), lighting that makes everyone look pretty/handsome (with or without beer goggles) and a window looking into the brewery operation. These features make it a really special place. Even the restrooms are rad. It looks like a lot of love went into every detail. The Beer: This is a true tasting room. I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing. I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best. With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong. My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special \"reserve\" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well. Best to check out their Insta and Facebook pages for weekly beer offering updates. The staff: Great staff, knowledgeable, welcoming, efficient and accommodating. Eager to make you feel right at home. The food: I've eaten many burgers in my life, let me tell you. Had the most delicious. burger. ever from the onsite food truck. I think they are called, Fire and Forged. Like the Shop, the food truck folks took great care to give me their best. Quality beef cooked to medium rare perfection. Homemade pickles (homemade pickles people! Who does that!?!). Real/non-iceberg lettuce. Some seriously special sauce, too. Paired wonderfully with the Nines! (See what I did there? ) Overall: Great night out with the Mr. Even bought a couple super softy shirts and of course bought a few cans of the Nines to take home to CA. Do yourself (and your mouth) a favor and get over to the Shop. They are doing some seriously good work there. Wish we had one back home...\n",
      "Great beer and venue. Like how the beertender was mellow despite some Tempe bartender douchebag telling him he needed to speak louder and with more authority. The pale ale is surprisingly more hopped and higher IBU than the IPA. I enjoyed IT. They have a food truck out back and a huge patio so could be a great place to bring dogs as well.\n",
      "The Shop is one of my go to jams for craft beers with a solid vibe. The staff is extremely knowledgeable/helpful and it shows in the beers they produce. They have a food truck in their patio area that has a constant presence; the chef consistently rotates the menu with all kinds of goodness that pairs fantastic with the brew. Must try beers when you go are Church Music & F.Y.I.T.M. ..... However, you can't go wrong in any selection you make. Might as well take a flight or two and experience for yourself. Cheers\n",
      "This place gets an A+ for style and beer. The ceiling of this building is beautiful! The taproom is super comfortable and the patio is spacious and clean. They have a permanent food truck that turns out burgers and other beer friendly food. I had the hoppy red and the 480 pale ale. I was very hoppy, I mean happy, with both.\n",
      "There a a few times in life when we find a beer so expertly crafted we want to linger and savor the time and wisdom of our experience. This is one of those moments. My personal favorite \"The Nines\" is an Ale with balanced fresh caramel elements to complement its Red identity.

      "The Shop Beer Co is located in N Tempe not too far from ASU ... It's a smaller cozy cool independently owned microbrewery that I didn't know ever existed. One of the girls in the group had purchased a beer tasting deal off of Groupon and it was as an amazing price/deal!!! The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!! It's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look... There is also a large back patio, a food truck, and then the bathrooms are located near the actual brewery area in a separate building. I am not a huge fan of alcohol, beer in particular, but I was open to tasting specialty micro brewed beers. Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink. A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say. I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light/amber, and the beer made by/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion. When we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down. But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening. The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow.... The crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ... So it wasn't really our scene and I doubt I would go out of my way to come back here ... There is just too many other great spots to hang out in Tempe & Scottsdale. This place earns a solid 3 start review because it was good/average ... overall there was nothing very good/exceptional or memorable about my experience here other than the fact that they offered a phenomenal groupon deal. It's definitely worth checking out though, and I would recommend beer lovers to definitely come try it out! If you are not a huge fan of alcohol or you don't like beer ... This is not the place for you because to my knowledge for the most part they only serve beer and water.\n",
      "Awesome Brewery! I stumbled across this place on it's opening day, at least the opening to the public, and even that's kind of an opening. Today was friends and family day, and special invited people, but if the public showed up but let them in and give them a free beer! So, I showed up!... and who did I get to meet but Harry Mitchell, Kelli Butler, Dr. Eric Meyer, and a whole bunch of people who really love brewing craft beer. It was a great crowd, and excellent beer. There were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig. I had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable! I definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!\n",
      "Totally cool hangout! I found this place when I was out jogging around Tempe Town Lake. It's a quaint little house with a really cool patio. They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos. I love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and bar seating. This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge. That, in my opinion, is good business. I will definitely be back for another visit .....soon! Loved it!\n",
      "The Shop is THE BEST LOCAL INDEPENDENT BEER in the Phoenix Metro Area! Check them out... clean chill tasting room, incredible staff, and outstanding Fire & Forged food truck in the beer garden... 5 STARS oh and of course GREAT BEER!\n",
      "Really cool layout. The beer garden is a nice additional too. But the service was not great. The waitresses were sitting at tables. One was counting her tips and another was eating food and sitting with friends. The beers are alright. I wish the experience was better it's a cool atmosphere. Won't be back though.\n",
      "Great little patio, good beer, one of my first picks for a spot to hang out and relax, now I just need to figure out what to do with my kids so I can do that more often. There is a food truck always on site, so it is really just a kitchen in a box, I don't know why they took that route but I assume it is a permit based decision. The nitro stout I had was everything one would expect it to be.\n",
      "Live right down the block and am a regular here. Good beer selection with friendly service who continuously checked up on us. The food from the food truck served the basics: burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, but they're all well done and cheap. The times I come late from work, I walk over and have a great cheap meal with a pint. Love this place.\n",
      "Husband and I stopped in around 4:00 on a Sunday to try a beer or two while visiting Phoenix. Two employees were inside, one of whom was talking/flirting with a patron at the only occupied table inside (one other table was occupied outside). Neither employee in any way acknowledged either of us. We reviewed the beer leaf for a minute or two, still with no acknowledgement from any of the staff, no hello, no invitation to find a seat etc. felt extremely pretentious, and not our scene. We left and were much happier and better-accommodated at Four Peaks.\n",
      "New to the neighborhood, and certainly a welcome addition. This place is worth taking the path off Mill. Great beer, staff and vibe. Do yourself a favor, and stop in savor the flavor. \"I just made that up\" :)\n",
      "Great new place to have a some tasty microbrewery beer. Super friendly staff. 4-6 of their own beers available. Food trucks on site if you get the munchies. Coffee Brown Nitro was my favorite.\n",
      "The Shop Beer Co. knows what they are doing! I went here last weekend with some friends, and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was really great. There is a beer garden out back complete with a food truck and plenty of seating. I had their Sunset Daydream IPA & it was delicious! Very refreshing, summery with the right amount of hops. I will definitely be coming back, and would recommend this as a great spot to come with friends or to grab a quick beer after dinner!\n",
      "I checked this brewery out with a groupon for 4 people. Beer and service was great! The location is weird since it's in a residential area but the place itself was very cool! Indoor and outdoor and the weather was just perfect for outdoor seating. We didn't try the food truck but it smelled delicious. I will definitely be going again and I suggest y'all try it! Groupon has a sweet deal for this brewery\n",
      "Keepin' it simple & all about the beer! Love the vibe. No TVs, no sports games blaring. Just drink some beers and talk to your friends! They had a few different IPAs on tap, of course I tried them all. We had just ate dinner elsewhere, so we skipped the food truck, but will definitely be back to try!! They're just getting started, and I'm excited to see what's next for this new spot!\n",
      "Had an awesome experience with my girlfriend over he weekend. The Church Music IPA and the \"Fight-Em\" DIPA were both ridiculously smooth. The food truck outside offered reasonable sandwiches to split and expedited service. I rate the whole experience as a 10 out of 10 and can't wait for my next trip back there. Additionally I purchased a t-shirt that fit perfectly and is quite comfortable.\n",
      "Always looking for new beers to try. Having \"the nines\". Great taste. Very friendly. Amazing atmosphere.\n",
      "Ambience was great - small beer tap confusion on the second pour but overall great experience\n",
      "Bring your beanie and your judgmental hipster attitude! I wanted to love this place but we had such a bad first impression. My boyfriend and I had gone hunting and showed up to this bar in our camouflage. You would have thought we were aliens by the way people looked at us. We just wanted to try some good beer via a Groupon I found. Service was okay but the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming. The beer was good. I enjoyed the Coffee Nitro. My boyfriend liked the IPA but thought it was a little weak for a double. Flavors were good overall. When we left I expected some sort of conversation and I would have left a tip. Instead we were told to redeem the Groupon on our own and that was it. Customer service is a must! My advice would be to welcome people from all walks of life, not just the local hipster crowd.\n",
      "A little bit off the beaten path, but defiantly worth the trip. GREAT selection of beers. Cool little tasting room, and a food truck outside. I sampled plenty of beer, but didn't try any food, I will next time! What ever you guys are doing, KEEP IT UP!\n",
      "There's a great Groupon out for the place. I would Highly recommend the restaurant to any locals in the area that enjoy a good beer\n",
      "Awesome beers, awesome tasting room, great service. Met Dave and he got me all hot and bothered.\n",
      "Excellent beer. Best brewery we visited on our short trip to Phoenix. Their collaboration with Modern Times \"BINGO BANGO BONGO IPA\" was amazing. We didn't get a chance to try the food, but we will definitely be back next time we are in the area.\n",
      "The guys running this place are awesome. They are very knowledgeable and friendly, and have turned this into one of the best places in Tempe. I have been a few times and the first time I thought it was difficult to find coming from Mill and around the train tracks. This time I came right off Rio Salado and it was right there. Much easier coming from that side. They have a great selection of beers, and always something new. The DIPA is a staple and one of the best in town. I had a couple of new IPAs this time (Church Music and Circus Bandit). Both were great. They also have crowlers available in the cooler. They do not have a food kitchen, but there is a food truck that stays there and serves excellent food. The inside bar is very nice with a lot of space, but for me the real highlight (at least for most of the year) is the patio. It is very large, has some trees, a portion of it is under a roof and makes for a great time. This past visit it was a perfect afternoon with good weather, a nice breeze, good music, and awesome beer. I could chill out there all evening. Definitely one of my favorite breweries in Phoenix and it's run by great people. I will always support them and their beers.\n",
      "Great Beer, great atmosphere, great people!!! Yep the Cartel guys can't go wrong with good peeps and good beer!! Love the beer garden!\n",
      "This is a neat little brewery. They currently have four of their own beers on tap. I tried the Hoppy Red, the Sunset Daydream IPA and the Coffee Brown on nitro. All three of them were pretty good. The also have a nice food truck in the parking lot. You order the food at the truck and then they find you and deliver it to where you're sitting inside. The servers were all friendly and very knowledgeable about craft beer.\n",
      "We love local beer and couldn't wait to pop in here. Love it!! Good selection of dark beers. The coffee brown nitro is my favorite. I think more breweries need to make dark beers. They are smoother and less hoppy.\n",
      "Great beer, great atmosphere with a really nice outdoor patio. We moved here recently from Chicago where food trucks are big at many tap rooms, none though serve food as good as what we enjoyed here from Fire & Foraged. Everything about this place is 5 stars.\n",
      "Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable of their brews. Beer is brewed to perfection. Clean and great prices. Food truck on property with a lunch box special that comes with food and a beer for $6, can't beat it! Food is awesome! Great place to have a beer with the people you love. Highly recommend trying it out. We will definitely be coming back!\n",
      "My friend told me about this place and it has easily become my new favorite local brewery. I usually come here on Wednesday's for their Randall (they infuse one of their beers with some other yummy ingredients)--I just recently had their pale ale with persimmons, dates and currants and it was so tasty! The food truck out back (Fire & Forged) cooks up some amazing, fresh food and switches up their menu frequently. The back patio is beautiful and dog-friendly. This place just kills it all around.\n",
      "Jason, Matt, Dyllon, and Dave. Great little venue! Beers are awesome and the mood is just right. If you are looking for that spot this is it. I wish you all the best and thanks for making my business a success with the local crafted beer from your brewery. I carry four of the six beers you craft and my customers up here love them. If you are ever in the neighborhood and looking for a great pairing of local crafted beers and true farm to table seafood and steaks then stop in and say hello! We are located at 32409 N Scottsdale rd. #107 Scottsdale Az. 85266. The Bourbon Cellar. We are in the Summit Plaza. CHEERS!\n",
      "Was in on Sunday evening. Very welcoming greeting from Brittany. Had a couple of samples. Brittany was very knowledgeable and got us just the beer we wanted. That FYITM is great. Craig at the food truck was super friendly as well. Food was awesome. Want that burger again already. The Shop has a great ambiance, better beer, and even better service. Cheers Brittany and The Shop.\n",
      "My wife found this place on Groupon and it was a great bang for your buck. Not to big of a selection on house beers, IPA'S & coffee. The place seemed a little quiet, I'm sure it was just the night of the week we went but still a great atmosphere. I would definitely go again.\n",
      "Hooray for The Shop Beer Co! They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall. A week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit. I also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check. How they keep that organized, I would like to know.\n",
      "This place is AMAZING. My favorite things about it: 1. The beer (obviously). Bingo Bango Bongo is beyond superb, as is Church Music and of course the ol' standard, F.Y.I.T.M. 2. The music. Seriously, do you guys have a Pandora station? Whoever set that up has excellent taste and the music matches the atmosphere really well. 3. The service, both inside and at their partner food truck outside. You can't beat this place for a relaxing Saturday afternoon hang out or great happy hour spot. Love The Shop!!\n",
      "Great little brewery. I love places like this that are smaller and cozy. Nice wood inspired interior with exposed trusses and wooden bar tops. 15 beers on tap; 7 of their beers and 8 guest beers. I'll definitely be back.\n",
      "Food is amazing and the people are really friendly! shop is tucked away so dont miss it\n",
      "Great service (Amanda) and solid but average beer. This place has potential, and they are clean with their styles if not adventurous. I look forward to what their future may hold.\n",
      "Delicious fucking beer! One of my favorite beer festivals is Made in the Shade in Flag because lots of awesome breweries show up and I get to try so many new beers. I stumbled upon The Shop's tent in the first hour and I didn't leave. I kept going back because they were pouring this delicious IPA that I couldn't get enough of, I didn't care what anyone else was pouring - it was that good. When I got back to Phoenix I couldn't find the brewery anywhere. No one had heard of The Shop, it was like I made it all up in my drunken stupor. Finally someone did mention the name and I got the scoop that they wouldn't be opening for until August. I started counting down the days till opening so I could get a taste of summa that epic beer, today was that day! My favorite brew is a double IPA is called FYITM. Someone told me it stands for Fuck You In The Mouth and I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that my taste buds get an orgasm every time the beer enters my mouth so I think it's a solid name.\n",
      "This is an awesome neighborhood brewery. It looks like someone's house with a food truck parked outside of it; apparently it was Mayor Mitchell's dad's home? Anyway, they have their own selection of brews as well as some guest beers. So far my favorites have been the Coffee Brown Nitro and the Circus Bandit. Many of their beers are a bit too hoppy for my taste, but their porters have been great. Their guest beer selections are usually pretty solid picks as well. Every Wednesday they do a special brew called \"The Randall\" that they infuse with their flavors of the week. Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio. They do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new. I recently had a salad here with hummus on it and who knew that salad needed hummus?! The space is cool-lots of patio seating, about 12 seats a the bar indoors and eight 4-tops. This could be a great option to buyout for a birthday party or small wedding reception to be honest; it has nice ambiance! This is a nice reliable place, walking distance from my house that I can just have a beer, a snack and leave pretty happy about all of it.\n",
      "Despite how humble and unassuming their outside is, this is in the running for one of my favorite arizona breweries. Beers I sampled: The nines red: smokey but balanced all the way through. Bingo bango boingo: top ten IPAs I've had in my life. Super hoppy without the bitter taste. Would love an IV drip of this... Desert pale: usually I cling to pales but this one was overshadowed by how amazing everything else was But wait there's more! Then we start talking to the owner of the food truck planted outside, Craig. Solid guy. Lots of experience in the Fox concepts and Vegas restaurants and we got to chat him up about his experience. Really great guy. We ended up getting the meat and cheese board and he knew everything about where the meats were from, where the veggies came from, how they were pickled and everything. Can't speak highly enough of Craig or this place.\n",
      "Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The vibe here is super cool and the atmosphere is inviting. This place is just getting started as it's only a few months old. I just wish we had pieces of paper to write our beer flight choices down.\n",
      "Amazing beer garden! Fantastic beer - love the 480! Great staff! This is already my favorite hang out place!\n",
      "Grab a glass and hit the beer garden! This amazing brewery in Tempe has a unique hip vibe with laid back attitude. A place you can definitely taste one of a kind beer flavors as you kick back with friends. We happened to visit during non-peak hours and we're lucky enough to spread out at a picnic table outside. From the patio lights and graffiti art, to the food truck and viewable brewery, the backyard neighborhood personality shines through. Enjoyed the 'Church Music' and 'F.Y.I.T.M' brews. Definitely a place I'd like to hit up again!\n",
      "This is such a great place! I love craft beer and I'm happy to support local businesses. This might be our regular spot in Tempe. It's better than going out to Mill Ave with all of those bud light beers.\n",
      "This is a cute little gem off of Mill Street. My friend that goes to ASU told us about it so we decided to make the drive from Gilbert and check it out. We purchased the groupon and each got a flight, a pint, and two crowlers. It really was a great deal however, they were out of a couple of the beers we wanted to try and the food truck is... meh. Pretty pricey for what you get and our chicken and fish tacos were a little dry. The chips and dip were delicious. Homemade chips with almost like a French dip. The environment is intimate and friendly and it's not usually busy. Not sure if we'd check it out again since we tried the beers we wanted to and weren't completely sold on any. BUT cute place to stop if you're in the area.\n",
      "What a great spot and atmosphere! Oh and their beer is some of the best AZ stuff around! Can't wait to day drink there.\n",
      "It was just okay. Nothing special. A little small and none of the beers blew me away. It's a nice little neighborhood brewery that would be great if you live within walking distance.\n",
      "the staff are friendly and the beers was good. those who like old school strong ipa the FYITM was made for you. ask what it stands for. I got a 32 oz can just for the name. good beer overall. Alley enjoyed her time there. everyone was friendly to her and the neighborhood had plenty of cats.\n",
      "Lots of hoppy IPA type of beers, friendly staff cool concept and always a different food truck\n",
      "Came here because they had a really good Groupon. Left extremely happy! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of their beer. We had a couple flights, liked them all. Had a couple pints and left with a couple crowlers. They have a permanent food truck outside that had some great choices and the owner and head chef came around to check on his customers. Next time I'm back in town I'll definitely be back. Keep up the good work!\n",
      "This place is great. The ceilings! That patio! Ahh, it has such perfect lighting. I tried the nines & a special beer infused with tequila in celebration of Mexican Independence Day. Both good beers. Would be a lovely spot for small events. Talented group of people brought this place to life!\n",
      "Awesome and cool place. Service was good and the beer even better. I had a flight of 4 and the double IPA is simply great should have taken a crowler of it home. Will definitely be back!\n",
      "Love this place! All bartenders are amazing, service is great, has a very homey feeling and being able to hang out with the owners and brewers while you drink is exactly what you want out of a brewery! Amazing beer, especially the F.Y.I.T.M.! I recommend it to everyone I know! Added bonus....the food truck, fire and foraged is absolutely unbelievable! All local. All grass fed. Always on sight!\n",
      "The beer is pretty good and the food truck there is always great. I am giving this review because they are obviously short pouring their customers. You will note their glasses are exactly 16 ounces if they are pouring over. They do offer some beers at a 13 oz pour but even when you get the 9 oz, 13 oz, 16 oz pours you will often get short pours for every single one of them. I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way. After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad. I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering. Although they have good beer being ripped off leaves a bad taste in mouth and there are plenty of other breweries that offer just as good of beers if not better and do not rip their customers off.\n",
      "Very nice!!! Great live music. Young people, truck food, prices alright, good location.\n",
      "Small place with three solid dark beers on tap, in addition to the more usual ipas and wheats. Enjoyed our beers very much, the server was helpful and sweet, very pleased'\n",
      "This place is amazing! I cannot recommend it enough from the staff to the food to their beers... I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could! We came here because of their awesome Groupon deal but we will definitely be back! They've only been open for 3 months but they are already doing a great job! If you're looking for a low key cool vibe type of place this is the place for you. It's really a hidden gem so hopefully it stays on the DL for awhile longer.\n",
      "Great place to have a few beers. They have a awesome outside sitting area and with the weather now you can't beat it. The server takes her time and explains the beers to you and offers suggestions. Can't wait until I have time to go back again\n",
      "Incredible asian fusion, and an impressive sake list, if you like that sort of thing. Mmmmm... coconut-crusted mahi mahi.... Just start ordering and keep going until you are full. But save room for the dessert sampler plate.\n",
      "Delicious food. Good service. BUT-- if you are allergic to shellfish BEWARE-- they do not label all the dishes that contain shellfish. You might order, say, the tomato bisque or the black cod, only to find out later (the hard way) that they contain such items as shrimp paste or oyster sauce.\n",
      "I really love Kushi Bar, it's the kind of place that I wouldn't be embarrassed to take my old friends from Boston or New York to. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the dipping sauce just adds fuel to my firey addiction to sriracha. For vegetarians, I recommend the house salad (kumquats!), kimchi tofu, mushrooms, curry veggie and rice bowl and wash it all down with the gin rickey.\n",
      "I'm a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants, and I wasn't sure quite what to expect from Muramoto, but my dining partners (a chef and a personal chef) and I were thoroughly pleased with our light dinner on Saturday evening. We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time. Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. BTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening.\n",
      "Muramoto is a paradise if you are a sake lover. Their collection is enormous and I believed the owner claimed Muramoto has the best collection in midwest. If you are a sake lover and haven't been there, what are you waiting for? and if you don't usually drink sake, you should still try the sake out (especially the ones list under fragrant) and you might change your view about sake forever. For the food Muramoto is Asian fusion in tapas style. Although each plate might be only around $10, most of them are not filling (rolls are the exceptions) and at the end combining your sake bill the check might cost as much as $100 per person.\n",
      "[NOTE: this review is about Restaurant Muramoto, which used to be in the location currently occupied by Kushi Bar, but has since moved down the street 2 blocks.] In a handful of visits since it opened a few years ago, I've found Muramoto to have generally outstanding food and often less-than-ideal service. IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned. (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.) But, ahh, the food. This is probably the most creative food in Madison. I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor. There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls). That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads. In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing. Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.\n",
      "Like Leslie S. said Muramoto has a somewhat limited menu but what is on that menu is outstanding. I adore places that encourage tapas style/family dining and Muramoto's portions are what some may describe as small. (Two to share two entrees is just enough food.) Additionally I appreciate that food is brought out as it is done being prepared and does not suffer death under a heat lamp. For drinks I had Lychee Liquor and grapefruit juice which was mango-ey and so tasty. I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone. We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish) All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of \"Asian fusion\" done right. Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door. Also prices were not that bad. For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning. I wish the restaurant was bigger and took reservations because I'd rent out the whole place for graduation.\n",
      "Kushi bar will close at the end of August (may already be closed) http://77square.com/food/restaurants/story_462727\n",
      "Wandered in here looking for the restaurant and they told me to go down the street. They have some food, but it's not the same as the full restaurant. However, their shochu drinks are more extensive at this location, so I had a shochu shiso mojito. It was okay--not my favorite, but not bad either. Maybe I should have tried a drink that wasn't trying to be another drink. Anyway, the place is really nice, the bartenders are really nice. Well worth a visit.\n",
      "best meal i had since coming to Madison.(Been here 2 months) I would say that this place serves fusion Japanese Food. My recommendation is that this is the place to go with friends so that you can share dishes and try more stuff. Food quality is top notch and each dish really offers you a new experience. Only gripe about the place is that portions are SMALL and it's relatively pricey. expect to spend 20 plus per pax. A must try is their dessert sampler! Definitely going back : )\n",
      "Although I regularly miss Dog Eat Dog around noon every week day, I'm pleased that Muramoto replaced it and gave us a place to blow our cash on Sunday nights. The chef's tasting is key. And use the bathroom with the sink that makes you want to get out your GI Joes and Barbies and play in the bubbles all night.\n",
      "Please note: Pricey, gourmet Restaurant Muramoto has moved down the street, and Kushi Muramoto has become a sort of \"Izakaya\" style place. Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. I was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. I also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere. The pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the \"Muramoto Experience\" without bleeding yourself dry. However, when they said \"fried Snickers are our only dessert and they're only 2 for a dollar,\" I was so sick of panko fried tidbits, I said \"no\" without a moment or regret.\n",
      "Oh my did this place not live up to the hype. It was heinous how sloppy our rolls came out, my date's food came out a full 20 minutes after my own, and the black cod was incredibly salty. The place looked \"hip\" but that's about as cool as it got. If you are looking to make a fashion statement then by all means dress yourself up and head to Muramoto, if you are looking to enjoy your meal (be it tapas, sushi, real japanese or some fusion) look elsewhere.\n",
      "This place accommodated our party of 8 well-sauced gentlemen nicely. Our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful with our menu choices. Her recommendation of one roll and another fairly small plate was the perfect amount of food for us, as we had more beers to consume apres-dinner. I got the impression this is one of the nicer restaurants in Madison, because everyone was dressed up. Except us of course. In Chicago this would be a nicer-than-average sushi restaurant, but it's not on par with Japonais. Think more along the lines of Sushi Ra if the food at Sushi Ra were a lot better. Sort of a modern, almost trendy thing going on, with a pronounced wet bar. The food was good, but to be perfectly honest, I have no business reviewing a sushi restaurant since I usually don't get any of the real shit. If it's crispy and fried or if the flavor of the fish is masked by jalepeno, avocado, or cream cheese, that's just fine with me. So yeah, sorry I made you read this review for nothing.\n",
      "ASIAN FUSION WITH INCREDIBLE SAKE MENU. All info I've seen says 'tapas style', but I will tell you - these plates are not too small, and quite filling. Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights. Every so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF. Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!\n",
      "Who says the Midwest can't have tasty seafood? Dim and intimate, Muramoto is easily one of my favorites places in Madison. A varied menu with some fantastic Asian-inspired cuisine, this ain't your grandmother's Friday night fish fry. Update: swing by on Sunday night to try the blind chef's tasting. 4 courses ending in dessert for $30. Never disappointing.\n",
      "I had my first visit since they turned into a tapas bar style spot. Got to say, they're still serving the best \"imitation\" of the real stuff - doesn't really fly by me. But if you like that kind of thing, I suppose it's ok. Depending on the bartenders, some drinks are so underwhelming that it made me feel unnecessarily girly. Oh well. On the positive note, I think it is fun to try out many small plates. So 3 stars for the fun factors. The hype doesn't match the food, though.\n",
      "I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!) I end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!\n",
      "There were only a handful of rolls available at $10 each that are very fulfilling. I would recommend the soft shell crab roll. For some reason the Duck, Mango and Avocado roll made my stomach really queasy. I didn't try the sake because it was a Monday night, but I would come back for the oyster shot! A mixture of oyster, raw quail egg and spices it was something very unique! I had two before my meal. Slurrrrrp!\n",
      "Yep, I did it- 5 stars. After a few missed attempts at going to muramoto, we finally made it in. We tried some sake to start it off, and the Wakatake was superb- at the suggestion of the waiter. Next were the oyster/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide. On to the main courses- started with the tuna/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way. TIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations.\n",
      "Yum! Muramoto is really the best place in Madison for Sushi. Period. The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with. Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago. I get take out here at least once a week and dine here about once or twice a month. If you want fantastic sushi at really a quite reasonable price, this is your place!\n",
      "Just to be clear, this is a review of the new 'tapas-style' Muramoto. Ok, with that out of the way.... The Space: Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant. Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb. Great date place and it just feels sexy. The Food: I wanted to like it, I really did. We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good. In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese. Now thats not easy to screw up. The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle). The Drinks: Drinks were good. Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting. The Price: Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star. The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks. So all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date. Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu...\n",
      "Muramoto has moved into its new space and its all good (great space, expanded menu, same great staff)...but, I strangely miss the old space. Maybe some therapy for this reviewer.\n",
      "I like this place. The food and the service is great. Sesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it! The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens. Rock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot. They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home. Shrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good. It's very similar to Thai food. Hangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy. The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good. DESSERTS We ordered the Sample Platter. I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts. This Platter is perfect for two people. Yuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta. Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit. But it was very good. It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust. It also had a drizzle of some berry compote. Strawberry Spring Roll w/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll. It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well. I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream. Honey Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting. The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it. The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame. It's a clever idea but not something I would try again. Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite.\n",
      "I will never look at sushi the same way again! I am a huge sushi addict, and this is above and beyond the best place to get your \"fix\" in Madison. It even beats the places in DC that I've tried, and they do a cool new take on rolls. Everything was fantastic, my date and I ate 'til we were stuffed...then had dessert on top of that (a delicious creme brulee). At $10 a roll, these are more than worth the price..they are huge and come with their own individual sauces...no wasabi or soy needed. We had a saki flight...not my thing, but good to try once I guess. Service was great and I love the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!\n",
      "The food here is amazing. Kushi is like Japanese tapas - all small plate dishes here. I went here on a date and enjoyed everything we ordered. It was pretty deserted on a Tuesday night, but I've seen more people there on the weekend. The ambiance is loungy - and pretty dark, so it gives off a romantic vibe. A bit expensive, but worth it.\n",
      "Muramoto is a very good restaurant if you enjoy a limited selection of very good things. The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner. Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it. Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto. This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve). Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely. Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt. Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only. !!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location. This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos. On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm. It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character. Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down. I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy. But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good. The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off. You might as well keep going.\n",
      "Graduated in 2012, school was ok. Nothing really hard even though I took honor classes and one Peggy Pane class. Some of the teachers are cool though such as Ms. Gazier. Take her if you take honors chem. There's also Mr. Barkdoll. He's always funny and makes math really fun. Another teacher would be Mr. Bailey. Very easy going guy and an easy A if you show some effort and not be obnoxious. Some of the stuff isn't mandatory, such as Pep rallys, just sleep in and go to class 15 minutes before the pep rally ends. Basically, just enjoy high school on how easy and how little responsibilities you have before going to college.\n",
      "Has the only Peggy Payne Academy in the world that I know of, which is amazing!\n",
      "Good football team, wish they could be as good as the 5A schools but beggers can't be choosers. Best baseball team I have ever seen. Once a charger, always a charger!\n",
      "Pretty rude staff when I pointed out little mistakes on my nails. Also weren't happy about fixing my nails after only 12 hours and gel nails chipping. The gel nails which usually last me 2-3 weeks bc my nails grow slow, are now ruined and have only been 8 days\n",
      "First time to come here and I liked the full package... Service, manicure, variety of colors and the place is clean and has a great ambience. Definitely a favorite! ;)\n",
      "I love this place! Kenny is awesome! The owner is super cool and friendly. I have been coming here for 4 years and I would never go anywhere else. It's nice and clean and bright and open. I have been getting my nails done for 18 years and this is by far the best nail salon I have been to.\n",
      "First time at this place and they just got a loyal customer. Service was amazing and the spa pedicure was the best I've had in years! The gels nails were also great and a great hand/arm massage to come with. The price wasn't bad either!!! I am definitely coming back!!!\n",
      "WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Unprofessional. Disloyal. Rude. Lazy. After giving this place and my nail tech Kim business for over a year, I was turned away today because I like my nails buffed too much. Seriously? You mean you don't want to \"work\" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service. So understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service. I pay you money. I have the right to be particular. You have the responsibility to do your job well. Today, they lost a customer and a fan. What happened today was BS. I will NEVER recommend this business. I'm disappointed I can't give a zero star or negative star rating. Fancy Nails gets a big middle finger from me!\n",
      "I read reviews about this salon that were mixed so I decided to try it for myself. I called prior to actually going to the salon to find out prices as well as make an appointment. The girl who answered the phone took about 5 minutes to figure out what the cost of a basic pedicure was. Then I scheduled an appointment for 11am on Sunday. I get there just before 11 and no one greets me, I finally get the attention of the girl who answers the phone and let her know I have an 11am appointment for a pedicure. She says oh okay pick a color and we'll be right with you. I wait 10 minutes, then they have me sit in a pedicure chair. Another 15 minutes waiting for someone to finally become available to do my toes. Holly did a really great job, but waiting 25 minutes after I made an 11oclock appointment is disappointing. I go to pay and the girl who answers the phones also takes care of the payments. She seriously had no clue what she was doing. She asked me what it cost and I said $22 as It stated on the menu. This girl up front really has to get it together, she is completely clueless. I am sorry to say I won't be back to this establishment.\n",
      "I love this nail shop and I am very, very particular. It's super clean, with disposal liners in the pedi chairs. The decor is very cute. They have coffee and water for clients. They're a a wide variety of colors and brands of polish. Love Teresa's work and Tina gives great pedis too. They ensure their customers are happy.\n",
      "This place is so clean. They engage you and talk directly to you and no cross talking. The owner runs a tight ship and you can tell. I really like coming here and always leave satisfied. They do such a good job. A spa pedi is only 22 and its amazing. Go here!\n",
      "Awesome experience, Brenda took her time and did a great job. Salon was clean, prices were reasonable.\n",
      "This Salon is beautiful.. Very clean..people are friendly... Diana Hackett is amazing....great nails ..great Pedis'\n",
      "Came here yesterday for a gel mani and pedi . Clean salon and disposable liners in foot tubs Appreciated that they soaked my acrylic off instead of trying to \"pop\" them off . Tina did both my hands and feet and both are completely on point . Not to mention she took extra care and detail , plus the massage was amazing . I like that they offer a menu of ad ons for their pedicures as well , I love options . I will be back to this salon and will book an appointment with Tina again . Thanks Guys !\n",
      "love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try. each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2-3 weeks since march. i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure. I haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments. the have great selection of gel/ shellac/ gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services. go during the week! their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week. that being said they like to take their time during the week. sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch. (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes) i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare.\n",
      "Very impressed... Hannah did a great job. I love the disposable liners for pedicures. The only drawback was that I had to wait about 35 minutes for the appointment I made in advance.. But I would certainly recommend!\n",
      "Had an absolutely wonderful experience here this past weekend! Steven was in town and did not nails with a gel manicure. He did a great job and took his time.. I did not feel rushed one bit. This will be my new favorite place to go.\n",
      "Steven is the best here. He listens and does what you ask. No sharp square nails here. He does a great French pedicure. The price is great can't beat it.\n",
      "I'm only in Phoenix visiting, and this salon is by far one of the best I have seen. I wish I lived here so I could come get my nails done here more often. They have complimentary coffee and tea at the entrance :) They have great service too! Ask for Kim or Steven to do your nails!\n",
      "Awesome price of $25 for a gel mani. Lots of OPI gel colors too! Everyone is really nice and takes their time. My favorite place :)\n",
      "Salon is trendy and certainly FANCY! Pedicure includes a wonderful and lengthy foot and leg massage. Hundreds of nail polish color options and competitive pricing. I'll be back!\n",
      "I recently moved to this salon after 5 years somewhere else that was close by. This salon is great. Great prices, very clean and great service. The techs dont sit on their phone the entire time you are there :) I will be ditching the other salon and using this place from now on! Great find. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Last week was first visit to Fancy Nail. It is clean, they use disposable trays for pedis. The pedi was nice, good massage, lots of colors to choose from, offered bottled water. One of my toes got messed up from her putting my flipflop back on, but she fixed it right away. I also had an acrylic nail fill with gel polish & top coat. She did a good job of keeping them thin, nice colors to choose from, although they longer use Shellac. I never felt rushed the whole time I was in there and everyone was nice. However, when trimming my cuticles, she cut mine & it was bleeding~Not Good because No nail salon puts new tips on their drill for every new customer :( I think I would go back for a pedi but def not for a nail fill.\n",
      "I just moved to Phoenix and decided to try this place out. It's very clean, lots of colors to choose from, and close to my house. Every time it come in here they seemed very rushed and try to get you out of the door as quickly as possible. No room for relaxation. One time I did back my nails done by Steven, he's by far the best and takes his time. I'll probably be branching out if I can't reserve with him in the future.\n",
      "Still getting great service several years later! I've never have a bad experience here, even when they are packed with customers. To those that are especially particular or love a more pampering experience and for the tech to take more time with them, try going during the week and during the day. If you like extra pampering, why would you go at the busiest time? It's common sense to go when they don't have a lot of other people to distract them and common sense to not go at the end of the day when they are exhausted and ready to go home, especially if you are a walk-in. That is with ANY business. Their busy time, btw, is weekends, especially late in the day.\n",
      "I love this place! They give great services for the price. I got a mani and a pedi there and they were by far the cheapest, and the cleanest!! They take care of their clients. The best part, is they rememer you! it had been a while since I went there and they mentioned that to me. I will definately be going back there!\n",
      "First time at Fancy today. Walk-in appointment and I got sat immediately with Ha. She was very good! Very clean and quick technique. The salon is very nice and welcoming...they offer coffee, water, etc. I recently moved to the area and will definitely be back!!\n",
      "I often travel to Phoenix, but I've never been able to find a great nail salon that's the trifecta: clean, reasonably priced, and does great shellac...until now. I called to check to see if I could come in without an appointment and was able to get in right away. I was greeted by the salon owner, who removed my old shellac and then prepped my nails. His next appointment arrived, so he sent me over to HaLee, who did my nails. She was awesome - precision shellac, super-nice, and very quick! The salon is very clean and tastefully decorated. The cost of the manicure was very reasonable, considering what nearby salons were trying to charge. I'll definitely visit again! Very happy.\n",
      "I have been having my nails done now for over 30 years, and over this time frame, I have lived in 3 different states. I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he did a great job, my nails lasted, and all was well! For personal reasons I had to find a new salon. So I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun! So I was stressed after that , and knew I needed to find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today. I took my time,and for 2 weeks, I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go. I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix. I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about 4 of the salons, and went in person, to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders / colors. When I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax. They didn't have the chunky/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better. I always got compliments on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?! After a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself. So I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right? wrong!!.... It helped, But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long 2 times, and I like them extra short, make them very short. They said yes but, they did not. After 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back / fill and use \"her\" medium pink powder. and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG\n",
      "I was looking for a nail parlor that was close-ish to my area, and this place by far had the best and most consistent reviews. Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. It's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me. I do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience. But getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. And I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing. A week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. I think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! Please do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip.\n",
      "Im a regular at fancy nails, I just love their staff and service. They just moved the salon a few doors down to a bigger spot, which has better air ventilation(no nail odor). I usually come with a big party because they have plenty of room to accommodate us all. I get SNS and a pedicure which last me about three weeks. Highly recommend this salon.\n",
      "Best Salon ever! I'm so sad to be moving soon and I will miss David and Steven terribly.\n",
      "Since I moved to Phoenix, I've happily driven 18 miles (one way) to have my nails done here. Definitely the cleanest nail salon I've ever seen. I like that they use disposable liners in the pedicure tubs. Amazing colors of gel and regular polish. Friendly and detailed staff. Wish I could give 10 stars. Very reasonably priced.\n",
      "Been coming to Fancy Nails for a few months. The place is very nice offering a number of features that give it an edge-nice decor, curtains separating some of the pedi chairs, a Keurig machine with coffee. Pedicures are relaxing and thorough. Very skilled nail technicians with both gel and acrylic. Got a nice bottle of lotion as a thank you Christmas gift last month. My new nail place!\n",
      "Best & cleanest nail shop in Northeast Phoenix! David & his nail techs have the latest colors! Try the mood gel polish! Changes color in cold or with water! They have liners in tubs and keep everything very clean! You will love it here! Thanks David & awesome nail techs!\n",
      "I'm a business owner myself. I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! I sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A.. How can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license! I owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.\n",
      "I will NEVER go to this salon again to get any service. I have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year. Last week I called to schedule an appointment. After waiting 20 minutes with feet soaking & water now cold-I asked how much longer it would be. The lady beside me said she would be doing my pedi & it would only be a few more minutes. I understand a delay, but what's the point of making an appt. if you wait that long? Once she began my pedicure she seemed to be rushing. I have 3 places on my feet where she rubbed with the pumice so hard that she burned skin off like an abrasion. This was on Sat, today is Monday & it still hurts & has not healed. I will find a new salon. Wish I knew the ladies name & I would post this!!! I told her it was hurting so she stopped rubbing so damn hard. After she painted my toes, she put antiseptic on the worst burn-that only made it burn more!!! Terrible service...unsatisfied\n",
      "Fancy Nails is a great place to go when you are in a rush and need your nails done. Firstly when you walk in they assist you right away, and soon enough your in your seat. Let's say you got gels they would check every coat before putting it in the light. And they turn out perfect! They also have a great coffee machine and water. The people are super nice and great at what they do. It is also a very clean shop which has super comfy chairs washed supplies and the nicest polishes. So be sure to go to Fancy Nails, the nicest and neatest nail salon on earth!\n",
      "Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I can definitely do a better job myself. In addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done.\n",
      "Overall great experience Everytime I have been in here. Weekends get slammed so if you want a longer massage and more time spent then you need to go in during the week. Very consistent in here as far as cleanliness and service. Always a great idea to call ahead and let them know you are coming to make sure there isn't a wait.\n",
      "I've been here four times and each time was relaxing. Its quiet, does great work, and I'm going back again next weekend.\n",
      "Holly is amazing I've been seeing her for years. She always helps me with my ingrown toe nail and she does an amazing massage. She cares with much detail. Best massage chairs in town. Great owner. This is my monthly stop !! :)\n",
      "I'm normally not a girly girl so nail salons don't really interests me but I was on vacation with my chica and decided what the hell, why not? So this review is from not your typical girl who gets their nails done routinely. I probably do it once every few years lol. Upon arrival, this nail salon looks very fancy and clean. Their tools I think are packaged and their prices are pretty standard. This place is also the 1st time in my life to get my nails done by a guy 0.0 I think the techs there are nice and friendly and they explained to me any questions I had like what is difference between gel manicure and regular ones. I believe there is a pretty big selection of colors to choose. Since I'm not an expert, check out my pics and see for yourself! :) Also, they provide free coffee and candy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my legs became a mosquito buffet but it's not their fault and it's pretty cool there with ceiling fans turned on.\n",
      "Very nice girls, clean salon and quick service. If you pay with cash, you get a 5% discount. If you pay with debit, you can't add a tip to the charge, so be sure to bring cash. I counted 17 people working today, very busy on the weekend, I dropped in with no appointment and got right in, 1 hour later, fresh mani/pedi in Lincoln Park After Dark (my favorite color). Go here!\n",
      "I've been to this salon twice. The first time was great and I was very happy with my gel manicure that lasted a very long time. The second time I came in and it was horrible!!!! I asked for a full set of acrylics. I got seated with the male tech. At first he was very nice and then when I asked for them to be a certain length he told me no and that that was ugly! I was so offended! I asked him again to go shorter and he refused. I finally picked a color and he did a horrible job. The color came out so streaky. I left and my nails looked horrible. My cuticles were still a mess, the lengths were all uneven and the polish sucked. I'm never going here again!!!!\n",
      "Went on a whim while running errands and I was helped right away. The salon was very clean and the chairs comfy. The staff was friendly and though it was busy it was fairly quiet so I felt I could relax. basic mani/pedi for $34, not too bad! Will be visiting again!\n",
      "Terrible!! This was my first and my last time coming here. I came for a relaxing pedicure and dip powder manicure. I sat for my pedicure in between 2 ladies who were already well into their pedicures yet mine was done way before theirs. How is this possible when I got the same services they did? I asked them what pedicure they got and it was the same as me. Maybe because a guy was doing mine and he seemed to hate his job. Hm... mine lasted about 15 minutes their pedicures lasted at least 30 - 40 if not more. Then I sit for my powder manicure. It was so bad I had the girl remove it. It took her 3 times of soaking my nails with the foil to get the gel off, that's how thick and awful it was. As I leave they charge me for my pedicure, ok fine, yes I got a pedicure, here's the kicker, she charges me $10 for a cuticle trim!! Are you serious? I left and immediately called my bank to dispute the charge. Worst customer service ever!!\n",
      "My manicure was sub par and the owner was rude. He refused my Amex card only after seeing that I had other cards in my wallet. As if that wasn't enough he was rude about it claiming they charge him too many fees. I will not return.\n",
      "This place is absolutely FANTASTIC!! I did not have an appointment, but they got me in right away. I had a full mani-pedi and an absolutely thrilled with the results. I believe it was Jessica and David who helped me and they were both friendly as can be. Hannah also was great. I definitely recommend this place!!\n",
      "Love this salon. Kim is very friendly and did a really nice job on my mani and pedi. The owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. The place is very very clean. I will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?\n",
      "Lovely ambiance Attentive staff Reasonable prices They use disposable liners for their foot spas, which lessen the risk of catching bacterial infection. Everyone is great, my favorite is Lynn. She is super talented!\n",
      "Needed a new nail place closer to my house so went here on a whim. I went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. Pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. My only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after I got home I noticed one if my toes was smeared. Luckily I brought my own polish so I could touch it up. I will be going here again.\n",
      "Just found this little gem! We both had fabulous paraffin spa pedicures with hot stone massage. Very nice!!! Hanna did a fabulous job on my powder mani! Everyone was super personable and the shop is beautiful and spotlessly clean... they are opening the new shop in four weeks and the pictures David showed us are OVER THE TOP!!! We will definitely be back... this is our new spot!\n",
      "Love this nail salon! They are clean, friendly and my mani/pedis always look awesome. I even took my 5 year old niece last time and they were so great with her! Don't forget to bring cash!\n",
      "I've been going to Fancy Nails since I moved to PHX in July of last year based on the Yelp* reviews and have never been disappointed. This is the first salon I have been to in a long time where I don't have a specific technician work on my nails. Every person in the salon does a great job. I am fortunate to be out of work before 3pm during the week so I can get to Fancy Nails by about 3:15...I've never had to wait for a service when I arrive around that time. I have been on weekends and it does get busy, so I'd recommend you make an appointment. The salon stocks OPI shellac/gel polish in addition to some other brands I don't recognize. A gel manicure costs $25. For all of my pedicure people, Fancy Nails uses disposable pedi tub inserts so no worries about someone else's foot funk touching your tootsies (big plus)! They have a few options for pedicures, so ask to see the menu before you start. They also offer waxing services and tanning as well but I can't comment on them since I've never used them. The salon is clean, well stocked, and everyone is always professional and courteous. There are plenty of other nail salons closer to where I live but I choose to come to Fancy Nails. They're everything I was looking for in a nail salon!\n",
      "Thank you yelpers!! I found also found this place to be awesome!! Clean and lots of gel colors and glitter to choose from. Ill be back there for sure!!\n",
      "This was my 1st time at Fancy. I took a chance coming in on a friday w/o an appt but was greeted and seated right away. I met Hannah and she did a gel manicure. Very sweet and friendly. She was quick and did a great job. Another girl did my pedi and I was happy with that as well. The place was nice looking and clean and I liked the service. Prices were fair and I will def be back!\n",
      "Had an appointment at 4:30. Hit bad traffic and called to say we would be 5-10 minutes late. Got there and it was not as if anyone had just been seated -- they didn't skip a beat with getting folks in prior. So, we had to wait. No one looked up and acknowledged us. Waited until 5:00, when we were finally acknowledged and we had to mention the appointment time that has long passed. My daughter asked for shorter nails twice and nail tech did not listen. 5:45 and still here. Frustrating. Tips: 1. Honor appointments. 2. Greet customers as they walk in. 3. Techs need to listen to their customers and also consider their age. My daughter is barely 14, and asked for shorter nails but did not get what she asked for. 4. When nail techs aren't busy, do not sit in front lobby area on your phone with headphones on all kicked back.\n",
      "Best nail salon I've been to in the Valley. I never have to wait. I don't ask for anyone in particular because every person who has done my nails has been fabulous. The polish lasts for longer than any salon I've been to. Love this place!!\n",
      "This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!\n",
      "Got a fill here about three weeks ago and my nails still look great!! Hannah did a great job and I will be back for sure!!!\n",
      "This place is worth every penny, everyone is friendly and professional and they do great work every time, consistency is everything! I live an hour from this place and it always puts a smile on my face walking out.\n",
      "Amazing place downtown Oakville that makes you feel very welcome and has a downtown Toronto feel. It's open a bit later than other places in Oakville therefore it's great for the night owl crowd. I've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on. Later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting Japanese Anime or Sumo wrestling on a big screen. The food is authentic and high quality. Their rolls are amazing. But what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular. They greet everyone in Japanese. I'll be back!\n",
      "My GF and I ate at Fin's on Saturday night Sept 21, 2013. We had the chef's special tasting box which had 9 different items. The honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best. There were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. There was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo. The tuna was tasteless. Etc. In addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. It is simply not a good restaurant and I would not return.\n",
      "What a gem! I'm so happy I wandered into FIn! Since moving to Oakville I've been searching for as many Toronto-esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! I've found a few great places there, but no food (especially Asian) has actually been that great - until Fin! I went here on a Sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 PM. We were greeted in Japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server. Food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of Izakaya in Oakville, I wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank. Personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the Eastern Style Caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!). Overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. I couldn't recommend Fin enough to those starved for a bit of Asian food in Oakville! Disclaimer: If you're from Toronto and eat Izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!\n",
      "warning. !!!!!! This is not the same fin as before sold to new owner ! Super dry pull pork rice burger and stale sashimi salad and gone bad chicken skewers were the 3 dishes ordered. I gave 15% tip that the owner dared to ask for such food and service, smiled back at the owners and said \"see you next time\" NOT!\n",
      "Way too expensive for what you get. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place was not worth it. Was recommended by a friend after telling her how much I loved Guu but I definitely can't listen to her anymore! It's a nice looking place and the service was good as well, but the food comes first and it definitely was lacking. Sashimi was on par with AYCE places, not what you expect when you pay 40 bucks for 16 pieces. Overall, not pleased with my food experience.\n",
      "Exceeded expectations. Ate early around 6.15 pm so was fairly quiet...2 others. Strangely asked if we had reservations...interesting! Sauvignon Blanc from Chile was good and can be recommended. Cucumber Addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at $1.50 each. Shichimi duck salad also very good. At $76 before HST & tip about right for the quality. Pleasant staff....will go again!\n",
      "Fairly new establishment on the Lakeshore strip in downtown Oakville. A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately. If someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated. I'll assume it is a greeting. The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else. The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof. Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere. Pretty much a tapas menu. After perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass. It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like. Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered. Any way, food: In absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry. A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti. Started with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil. A great clean-tasting starter. All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much. The Pork Rib Kakuni was really good. 3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour. This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs. The Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful. Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish. The Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish. A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort. The Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered. As the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in. There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space. Conversations can be heard from basically every table. The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight. A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us. Yaaaaay. This is where service fell apart. We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert. But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish. Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived. It was incredible and naturally buttery. Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously. Food for Thought: if you come for the special catches of the day, come early. 4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30. And the Blowtorch Mackerel? It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair. Maybe its just me and my wacky palette. Hopefully the \"trendiness\" wears off in the passing months. The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu. It is the clientelle that I could do without.\n",
      "Demi Colored my Hair yesterday and WOW! It's just what i wanted. I have been looking to do a soft ombre and she did it to perfection. I was bleach blond when i came in and left with a more natural looking blond!\n",
      "Finally a person who can cut my hair the way I like it. Anthony cut my hair and Demi did my color ... always comes out perfect!! I would recommend Theory Hair Design to anyone looking for a great cut. Thanks!!!\n",
      "I've known Demi since we were but wee lasses. I know for a FACT that she is one of the most passionate people I have ever met. She does hairdressing because it is her true passion. Even when we were down in the dumps she pursued her career energeticly and industriously. Not for money, leisure, or narcissism. She is extremely talented and near obsessed with what she does. It's a rare thing to find someone who loves what they do. Needless to say, she is an excellent colorist. She loves to try anything fun, new, and exciting (even though she tugs on my tender head ;) ) Anthony is also incredibly talented. As a former T&G instructor he knows what he's doing. He is extremely precise and meticulous when it comes to his work. It's not just a hair cut to Ant, it's art, and he wants you to feel exhilarated when you leave. Even if I say I'm going home to drink beer he'll spend and extra 20 minutes playing with my hair to make it look fantastic. I love you guys, keep up the good work xoxoxoxxxo\n",
      "I've been seeing Anthony for 12 years or so and have followed him and Demi from Toni and Guy to here. I can't say enough about their skills - they're the only people I trust with my hair. I have dark brown hair that many people have failed to lighten to blonde without it turning a hideous shade of orange and/or getting severely damaged. Demi has not only saved my hair from damage, but always takes my hair to the perfect shade of blonde. Before seeing them, I was told by someone at Regis that it wasn't possible for me to be blonde. Here I am, 12 years later, blonder than ever Thank you Demi and Anthony for saving my hair. They're an amazing team!\n",
      "Amazing team! Great hair by Demi and Anthony . I would Highly recommend for great color and cut...\n",
      "My fiance and I really liked this place. Huge step up from Stonepepper Grill. Our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point. Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?\n",
      "Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews! We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal. A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. Give it a try. Don't always go by the reviews. A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! Well with it.\n",
      "Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+ The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu.\n",
      "The wine selection was limited but of good quality. The appetizer Arancini were good but seemed to just be a little bland the tomato sauce helped but it too needed more garlic. My salad had too much vinegar and was drowning in it. The seafood Rollitini was ok but under seasoned. The strawberry mascarpone cake, basically tiramisu with strawberries instead of chocolate, was just good not great. Service was ok but given the lack of a crowd should it should have been better. It was not the best but far better than a chain store. Would I go back probably yes at least one more time. Suggestions to the owner. 1. Stop seasoning for old white people or at least offer to kick it up 2. Go to a team waiting model to give more attention to customers. 3. Make us customers feel special not by cupon for free wine but giving a shit, talk to us treat us like we are honored guests. 4. Keep the seasonal menu going. 5. Offer old fart seating at 4:00 to 5:00 \"give cupon for buy one pay 1/2 price for second \" you can offer the bland \"Special \" then.\n",
      "My husband and I went to Pazzo's for dinner during restaurant week. We were both disappointed with our entrees. We ordered off the restaurant week menu. We both loved the lobster bisque. My husband's crab ravioli was not warm. My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat. My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner.\n",
      "We loved our experience here tonight. Kim was our waitress and she was great. Our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat. I also have Celiac's disease, so no gluten for me. Our meals came out just right, they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat. You have now become one of our new favorite restaurants.\n",
      "This restaurant looks lovely. There are beautiful paintings on the walls. The tables are set nicely. You are greeted kindly. The servers are very nice. The decor/environment and the service is the only reason I can give one star. It was all downhill after that. I say all the time that of you can't get the basics right you can't get anything beyond the basics right. So we ordered two basic dishes-fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti & Meatballs. We chose to skip appetizers but a family style salad was brought to out table. It included a few cucumbers, a few grape tomatoes, some purple onions and a few croutons. There salad was cold but there was nothing memorable about it. We were also served 2 slices of bread. Again, nothing that stood out. The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our salad. It was awkward. When we went to eat our entrees they were room temperature. The meatballs were over cooked, dry, and didn't seem to have any seasoning. The spaghetti sauce tasted like tomatoes and not much else. I was extremely disappointed. I also tasted the fettuccine. It too lacked flavor. The fettuccine noodles were inconsistent. Some were cooked to the correct consistency but some were hard. We skipped dessert because we didn't want to take the chance of eating anything else that lacked flavor. It's safe to say that there won't be a second visit.\n",
      "Great food! Thoroughly impressed with bolognese, manicotti, and veal. Meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Service needs tightened up, but they're still new.\n",
      "Overpriced and flavroless. This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short. The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter. The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing. I had the chicken marsala ($18). The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender. The sauce, however, was a mess. It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan. It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning. Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too. I chose pasta with white sauce for the side. Bad move. It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt. My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22). It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big. They weren't overcooked. The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine. The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*. I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else. She chose broccoli for her side. Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal. Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards. The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out. I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick.\n",
      "The perfect word for this place is: bland. I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland. Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland. On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!\n",
      "I can't comment on the food here because we didn't get that far. We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.\n",
      "Save your $22+/ plate & take yourself over to Giant Eagle's Café. It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much. The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door.\n",
      "I don't understand the 2 star reviews. Lunch today was very good, especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb.\n",
      "The wedding soup was so good! After eating that I was hopeful that the reviews on here weren't accurate... I'm sorry to say that they are true! I would come back for the soup but wouldn't eat dinner here again. We came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor.\n",
      "I completely agree with Kimberly said. BLAND CITY!!! Hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers. But I doubt it.\n",
      "So far all the reviews have nailed it- flavorless and cold food. Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a \"family style\" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce? I'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the \"lightly breaded\" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be \"diablo\" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes.. We were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long.\n",
      "First time at this restaurant for my birthday dinner which was less than memorable. Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. \"Hi, just two of you?\"not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back\n",
      "My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table. A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made. Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value.\n",
      "We had a great experience for dinner a few days ago! The service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu. I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination. From our zucchini appitizer, family style salad, entrees and wine, everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. The courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm,remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes. We will be back!\n",
      "The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign. But still wanted to give it a try. No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. My menu was dirty. My silverware was dirty. Glasses spotty. Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....? Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. These little details could easily be fixed.\n",
      "The worst dining experience I have ever had. The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly. It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before. Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef). He basically ignored them. There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out. At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks. Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks. Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves. A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was. We had no signs of him until we had to search for him. This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had. Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty. I can't imagine it will be open long. If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills.\n",
      "I really don't have too much to say other than the fact that I sent my food back and decided to just grab something to eat somewhere else. Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately. Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up. Dinner was bland and not even italian food... Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right? Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley. The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better. Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75 For ketel one and some vermouth. WOW. There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews.\n",
      "The food is very good. But...... Bartender charged for a double. Should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00. When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!! They are sneaky and when they get caught, they are unapologetic.\n",
      "If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed. I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good. A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered. They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts. AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there.\n",
      "Review is based on service and bar only - did not order food. Place was empty on Friday night. First warning sign. My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign. We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!\n",
      "You're not going to find Nihari and Biryani at this spot. It's American food made with a \"desi\" twist. Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The \"white dude\" who is their head chef, couldn't be more \"desi\" when it comes to spices and food. Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here. Only con: they are only open till 7pm.\n",
      "So here's the thing. This isn't an Indian restaurant. No matter how you spin it. The \"naan\" is actually pita. The kind you buy in stores. There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza.\n",
      "Not sure why my lamb kabob meal took so long to be ready, but I overheard something about the rice still cooking, and this was at peak lunch hour (noon)! My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten. The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!! The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order. I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers... Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm! 3/12/14 I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go. The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun. I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future. I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!\n",
      "Their burgers are so juicy and flavorful. Also greatly priced, and did I mention the burgers! I only tried a beef burger but the chicken looked so good! Te service was great with friendly staff. Definitely must try again!\n",
      "Fresh food... exotic flavors. Their tag line says it all! I ordered the beef kabob on the recommendation of Phil, the owner, and I was not disappointed at all. The halal meat was moist and spiced just right... absolutely delicious! The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat. He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer. I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other items that other Yelpers have raved about!\n",
      "The friendliest worker ever works here. I think he is the owner, or just a very friendly man. Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get free stuff. Last time it was dessert, the other time it was mango lassi. The food is good and decent pricing. Sure, it's not the most glamorous presentations, but it is good for someone who is very hungry. This place just opened up like a 3 months ago, so they are pretty eager to get customers in.\n",
      "I usually come to Afandi a lot and would have never noticed the Sholay restaurant sign if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! Overall, this isn't entirely \"Sholay\". If you are looking for Indian (as in\"desi khana\") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place.\n",
      "First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings. Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird. Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.\n",
      "Absolutely #Loving this place is. Scottish Mussels w/garlic, shallots, cream wow! Pan fried cod w/ asparagus, languostinemushroom sauce on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes #ToDieFor #KidFriendly - so welcoming to kids even later night! Ps side salad so fresh and tasty lots of feta and the mushroom pate appetizer #FAbulous\n",
      "Went here for dinner with my mom on a one night stay in Edinburgh. We shared the mussels in shallots and cream sauce and they were delicious. Very generous portion. Had to ask for bread to sop up the sauce. For the main course I had the Roasted Seafood and my mother had the rump steak (can't remember the other name for it). Both were excellent. Steak was perfectly done and the seafood was fresh and plentiful. Definitely recommend it, just sorry this will likely be my only time there.\n",
      "Popped in to meet a friend for lunch. Looked very ordinary on the outside, but the food was top notch. My husband had the best steak he's had this trip here. Cooked perfectly and delicious!! I had a seafood curry that was also fantastic. Friendly, helpful waitstaff. Great experience.\n",
      "Mouth is watering at the thought, this was the best meal I have had in a very long time, staff were pleasant enough. Muscles were huge, so tasty and very well cooked, the basket of bread was replaced a few times. Will be back soon :)\n",
      "Altro ottimo ristorante situato a 20 metri dalla piazza Grassmarket,livello alto di cucina sia di pesce che di carne! Ottime cozze e pesci arrosto,buonissime ostriche scozzesi e deliziose bistecche di angus! Per concludere dolci ben fatti preparati da loro!!!! Servizio gentilissimo curato e giovanile! Saluti Luca!\n",
      "This place is really good, but a little pricy I think. Although they do have some drink specials and a pot of mussels for about 13-15 pounds. But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.\n",
      "Perfekt, man kann draußen sitzen und das direkt am gut frequentierten Grassmarkt. Lecker Fisch und Fleischgerichte, also rein mit dem Surf & Turf\n",
      "I ordered mussels with ginger/lime sauce and they were the best I have ever eaten. For £12.50, the portion was huge (may be 30 or more) and the sauce was more like soup at the bottom. It was spicy and delicious.\n",
      "it's been a while since I've posted anything to yelp - but I noticed a distinct lack of available info during my travels to Scotland and Ireland, so here goes This place is located at the (end of the) Grassmarket in Edinburgh - from what the guide books tell me, it would have had a great view of all the hangings (puir man got hangit) that took place there. The inside is modest but nice and aside from the somewhat crabbit (maybe German?) bartender, the service was just fine. We split a bucket of mussels (shallot cream white wine sauce) and I had an 8oz ribeye - the husband had something weird like pasta. The mussels were the best I've had in my life, truly amazing, and the steak, skinny little thing that it was, was delicious also. The quality of the local beef and seafood spoke volumes - no extravagant preparations or sauces required. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I went to The Mussel and Steak Bar after a date at the nearby BrewDog. The date was going well (oh la la) so he suggested stopping by this place for dinner. It was a Friday around 730 and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated for a table for two. The manager was cheeky and ribbed my date a little bit for pretending to look in the reservation book to pretend to be someone else, which was very amusing. We were able to sit upstairs and I thought the place had lovely ambience. We started with some fried goat cheese balls and garlic grilled mussels. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mussels but I thought \"When in Rome!\" and tried them. They were really tasty, but I'm not sure garlic was the best date choice! Anyway, for my main I had a special fried plaice with black pudding mash that was extremely tasty. My date had a steak that he enjoyed. Topped off with a nice glass of house white and I was a happy camper. I will definitely come back to The Mussel and Steak for another nice dinner in the future when I'm in the area, which of course I will be because I do love BrewDog...\n",
      "We had a light dinner here, it was fantastic! Fresh seafood at it's finest. Started out with Arran Smoked Salmon with Potato Scones, Crème Fraîche and Chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. We also split a kg of the Scottish Mussels, we chose Shallots, White Wine, Garlic & Cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. This was probably one of the best mussels pots I've had. Call and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the Bow Bar to pass the time). If you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of Grassmarket.\n",
      "The best surf and turf I have ever had. I stumbled upon this place by accident during a day trip to Edinburgh. It was during Scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside - a rare treat in our climate. We were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe. Now to the food. Me and my dad both opted for the same thing - the surf and turf. This consists of a Rib Eye Steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. Being a big fan of Asian flavours I opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. We also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein. When the dish arrived it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak (medium-rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood - not many things could look so appealing. All the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the Corona with lime just added to an amazing meal. Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a return here (I hope the heatwave will too).\n",
      "I went there for a casual lunch date with my SO. It is lovely. They have a pretty reasonable lunch and even dinner deal if you want to fine dine on a budget. I had the steak and it was great! So good and nicely flavored and cooked just right. The mussels are great! They have a Thai inspired flavor which is not bad if you want something different. I do recommend getting the French fries fries in beef jus. It's good and so much better than their plain potatoes.\n",
      "I'd recommend any seafood lover to go to the Mussels and Steaks Bar. Excellent food, great service and located in a bustling part of town. The decor is basic but the great tasting fresh food and friendly service more then made up for it. All the food was fresh, vibrant and flavorful. Our group tried the seafood platter, the special lobster dish, curry mussels and the surf and turf combinations. No one had a complaint about any of the dishes. The best part was the double fried chips in drippings.\n",
      "Heerlijk gegeten. In eerste instantie lijkt het wat klein maar boven zijn ook nog plaatsen. Het vlees is heerlijk en de mosselen ook. De wijnkaart is mooi en compleet en zelfs de whisky liefhebber kan hier uit de voeten. Een aanrader.\n",
      "This is a gem in an otherwise touristy Grassmarket. This place has fantastic food, Oysters, Fish, Steak, and plenty of other options. But the specialty has to be the mussels. Choose a mussel pot and have it in any of five ways to suit your palate and mood, just take your pick. Depending on how hungry you are choose a full three course, or share a divine starter and dessert. All this with great service, good price and fresh atmosphere.\n",
      "Fantastic seafood, with a wide menu selection. Staff are friendly, eager to please and not afraid to make an honest recommendation or suggestion. The restaurant is generally busy, mostly down to it's great reputation and location. The prices are reasonable given the quality and quantity. Also great at dealing with larger groups of dinners so a good place to book a special family meal\n",
      "I come here. A lot. Either with my mum or with friends (usually to celebrate a birthday) this has become a personal favourite eating place. Firstly, it does good food- whether you are into seafood or meat. You get to watch your food being cooked on a screen (which is slightly odd) and I love the layout of the ground floor- quite modern without over doing it. Look out for the fun facts about mussels in the toilets. The service has always been super friendly at this place. Being in such a prime location I was expecting shocking prices but I was pleasantly surprised. They have amazing lunch deals and I have never walked out of this place hungry. Sadly they only have one vegetarian option as far as mains courses go. Also, in the winter the upstairs floor tends to get really warm. Aside of these hitches Mussels and Steak Bar is a good standard for me.\n",
      "Was expecting a lot from this place based on the reviews, but honestly we didnt love it. It was just OK. Service was quick and friendly. They were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. Both the seafood and steak were good quality, but I guess they were just a bit boring. Boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. Although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium-rare) which was good. The queen scallop starter was OK, but the scallops were quite small and over-salted. Mussels were pretty good. Overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to Grassmarket on a regular basis.\n",
      "AMAZING! Went at tea time on Monday night and couldnt have left fuller or happier :) Waiting staff are very very attentive and friendly. I had smoked salmon salad for starters and mussels in white wine and garlic for main and it was superb. It is a wee bit more expensive than other places but I would say its definately worth it. Food served very fast as well.\n",
      "Everybody in my family likes something different. My Dad likes Italian, my Mum French, myself Indian and my sister Chinese. The problems it causes when we each want our restaurant to provide something different. As a comprimise, we often decide that a restaurant serving British food is the best option - but then its time for the real battle to begin. Light and fresh sea food or good and hearty steaks? It seems then that I should introduce them to Mussels and Steak Bar - which, as you would expect, serves Mussels and Steak. Its no secret in the restaurant that the produce is local (or at least Scottish) and the ingenious menu combines seafood and heavy meats in brilliantly tasty ways. The sauces used are outstanding, if a bit 'out there' and incredably mouthwatering (In fact my mouth is watering as I type). The restaurant itself is simple and practicle - and despite the annoying big screen TV's - has a seaside town feel to it,matching the down to earth cooking style. The staff are friendly and helpful, while the bar offers a large range of drinks. So there you have it, a restaurant which can cater for all appitites and in a mouthwateringly excellent way.\n",
      "We were in for the Edinburgh Festival and saw our favorite tapas place replaced by Mussels and Steak. The atmosphere looked a little cold and modern but the menu was interesting. In a word, the mussels were terrific! We tried the bacon and cream. Plump mussels, huge pot, delicious. Our scallop starter was equally good. The steak was fine but next time we are just doing mussels. This is really their thing. Not five stars as they just opened (second location) and fumbled a bit with forgetfulness and delays. The staff and owner were very friendly and apologetic. Highly recommended .\n",
      "I must say the name of this restaurant is straight to the point and those two things are exactly what my friend and I ordered. The steak was alright, I've definitely had better, but I will say that the mussels were pretty damn good. Very flavorful and piping hot when they arrived at the table. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Belgium, but they definitely weren't bad, and there was also plenty to share for two people. The restaurant itself isn't all that fancy but their service is. They make sure you're taken care of throughout the entire meal. Oh, you must get the Banoffee Pie. What's better than Banana + Toffee + Graham Cracker Crust. Absolutely nothing. It's heaven in your mouth.\n",
      "I don't like mussels. They are too strong and too fishy! Don't care for the smell and don't care for them in soups or stews. Until now I would have told you that I'd rather eat rattlesnake. Appearantly in Scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels. We stopped in at the Mussel and Steak Bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10:30 Tattoo. Our travel mate ordered the mussel starter. It arrived with green sauce on it. OMG, it smelled amazing. So much so that I had to taste it. The little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them. It is such a great combination! I had the surf and turf for dinner. The mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as I ordered it. All four of us agreed that our meals were delightful. The price was not out of line. Service was spot on.\n",
      "I went here recently for a colleague's leaving lunch. There were 8 of us in our group & it was quite busy. We ordered from the lunch menu - 1 course £7.95, 2 courses £9.95 or 3 courses £11.95. Most of the group ordered starters & the haggis dish was the most popular. I saved myself for the 6oz rump steak which was awesome. The chips were chunky & crispy, just how I like them & the mushrooms were earthy & full of flavour. My steak was perfectly cooked, moist & melt in the mouth. A colleague had the seafood curry. It was full of enormous mussels & other fishy delights. It smelled amazing & he said it was the best fish curry he's had. The only problem being that it took so long to arrive he didn't have time to finish it before having to get back to work. Unfortunately the service was slow and I we all had to skip dessert & coffee as we needed to get back to the office (despite being there over 90 mins). A lovely lunch with great food & company. It was a shame the slow service meant it was a wee bit stressful. The front of house staff were lovely maybe they just need another pair of hands in the kitchen.\n",
      "On our last day in Edinburgh, I still hadn't tried Haggis. And I really wanted to try it. The waitresses we excited to watch me try it for the first time, they were chatty but not overly. They were attentive, but not overly. I had a good time, but next time I'd like to take my time and order more and stay longer.\n",
      "An excellent experience - all of the food was of a high quality, as was the service.. Whether it was scallops, mussels, oysters or plaice, the seafood was first class and as fresh as the sea itself. Steaks were also delicious, both ribeye and sirloin. The wine choices worked well with the food and the choice of whiskies suited our need to try something different. Staff were terrific. Attentive, friendly and showing real concern for our table. We will be back.\n",
      "I went here for the langoustines, and they did not disappoint. They were nicely cooked and flavored with garlic butter. The main course of mussels came with at least 30, and they were delicious as well (we had the chili seasoning). Others in our group had steaks that were nicely cooked (medium rare) and tasty--great chips, too. Our waiter was a bit casual with the service, but the other wait staff picked up the slack. Overall, it was an excellent Edinburgh meal, with ingredients that featured the best that Scotland has to offer.\n",
      "Very easy to find. Seafood place with reasonable price. We enjoyed both the mussel and steak :)\n",
      "One of the best spots for seafood in Edinburgh, and one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Located just across the street from a longer strip of restaurants and pubs in the Grassmarket, it would be possible to pass the Mussels Steak Bar without giving it a second thought. That would be a huge mistake. I've made about 12 trips here for lunch and dinner, and every time I've always been greeted by an unbelievably friendly waiter or waitress. They start you off with some of the best crusty bread and softest whipped butter you'll ever taste, and they are happy to replenish it many times over. My favorite way to start a meal is with a kilo pot of their mussels, which are all ridiculously fresh and delicious, particularly with the white wine, shallots, garlic and cream sauce. Both the steaks and the seafood pasta (with loads of mussels, scallops, prawns, and calamari) are excellent main courses, and their fries with 'beef dripping' are some of the best I've ever tasted. Their wine list is not huge but offers good selection at reasonable prices. The meal can definitely run on the pricey end depending on the conversion rate (if you're an American) but I have never walked out of this place unsatisfied. Highly, highly recommended!\n",
      "Great steak, great mussels, and great cocktails. Fun vibe in a great neighborhood. Get the chips fried in beef drippings.\n",
      "Service was excellent!! The server was very attentive & accommodating. No one rushed or hurried us out even though we were the last to leave that night. Make reservations in advance if possible. The Mussels were not bad although I had to order bread as it didn't come with bread. The scallops & bacon appetizer was a delicious combination. Yum! The Surf & Turf lobster tail & braised beef was my favorite entree and a big portion. The sirloin steak w/carrots & cauliflower was great. However, the mashed potatoes were not that flavorful. Dessert - the chocolate mouse was good but the chocolate hazelnut (special of the day) was amazing! Must order this if you get the chance.\n",
      "Came for a late lunch and enjoyed great food, friendly service, and an overall excellent value. I recommend it.\n",
      "Our meal was stupendous! Got the surf and turf. Ribeye steak was juicy and cooked perfectly. The mussels were cooked in a whisky, bacon and cream sauce. OMG! Unbelievably delectable. Portion sizes were enormous. Smoked salmon duo for appetizer was just as good as the main course. Overall one of the best meals we had in Edinburgh.\n",
      "Wow. This place was Sooooo good. Oysters rib eye and cheesecake were all incredible. The side of mushrooms were also very good. The prices are great for what you get.\n",
      "Fantastic location but very small on the inside, can be a long wait. The seafood was only slightly above average in freshness and quality, and small portions, so had to knock off one star.\n",
      "So you get mussels or you get steak. We both got the steak. It was our first day in Edinburgh and the restaurant was recommended by a friend. Food was okay. My steak wasn't all that flavorful and the chips were a tad bland as well. Also, my food arrived to the table warm, not hot. Y'all know how I feel about that..... A little pricey but not really worth it. Service was very good.\n",
      "Wonderful steak, wonderful mussels, great value! A great place for meat and fish lovers like me - I highly recommend. Ess\n",
      "The other reviews are surprising. The first surprise is that a reviewer is surprised to find that Scotland, the north part of Great Britain (a well known island), has decent seafood. The second, and more disturbing, is the complaint that a restaurant with the name \"Mussel and Steak Bar\" has a fairly short menu. One might have thought, nay expected, that the menu would be mainly ... On a positive note, what I can say is that they provide first class food. What they say they do they do well. The steaks, in my experience, are meltingly tender. The chips (US: french fries) cooked in beef dripping are crisp and moreish. The restaurant is good value because not a morsel will be left on the plates.\n",
      "Stopped for lunch and we weren't disappointed. It was fantastic. My wife had the mussel special and I had the hot seafood platter. I watched them deliver a few of the Tomahawk specials and they looked incredible. My only disappointment was that the hot seafood platter was mostly mussels and not very varied but still well done. The outside look of this place does not represent the quality inside. Service was great.\n",
      "Stumbled upon this gem. An easy wLk off the Royal mile and below the castle. The mussels were tasty and the scallops were terrific. The cost was reasonable and the service was excellent.\n",
      "Came here with family for dinner on a Saturday night. We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at £14 for an enormous meal. Not the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.\n",
      "Very tasty food, great beer and really friendly service!!\n",
      "I never fail to enjoy a good feed at the Mussel and Steak Bar. Pot of mussels with white wine and garlic sauce does the job perfectly. The ambience is pleasant, but it's better to sit downstairs as the upstairs bit feels a bit empty and lonely I think. Food is generally lovely. Staff are generally lovely. Place is generally lovely. Go!\n",
      "Pool tables were in good condition and so were the sticks. Went on a Sunday and was charged $16/hour. It was a good experience and atmosphere overall.\n",
      "In University every Monday was the night reserved for a couple of pints and a few games of pool. I still have fond memories of those nights spent with my house mates and when we get together now and then, someone always brings up a pool related story or joke. Walking into Petrina's Taps and & Billiards for the first time recently, the similarities to my old pool hall brought back old familiar memories of my University billiards nights. Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it. Arriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?! Several libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students! Pool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change.\n",
      "Definitely not the classiest joint in town... or maybe it is...? The tables are old(er) but the felt is still in relatively good shape. Some of the cues have cracked tips but if you look, you can usually find one worth playing with. Monday and Tuesdays they have $5 pool from 6pm to 11pm (although I think that's gone up to $6 recently)... either way, you can't complain about that. They have a fully stocked bar and will make tea and coffee on request for those of us who don't drink. They also have a half decent menu with food that's prepared downstairs at Texas Burger (yum). You're pretty much in view of a TV wherever you are and they have a large projection TV in the lounge area allowing you to sit, eat and watch the game. I'm not saying it doesn't happen but I've never seen a rowdy crowd here and although I've been to better halls, this place is okay for a fun night out.\n",
      "Enrolling my 3 kids into their Sat morning Chinese Prog. The facility is clean and well organized. They seems to focus on academics, kids are grouped by level and not age.\n",
      "My child has attended this school for the last 9 months. Learning ABCs and math and chinese, playing outdoors and indoors. The School has lots of different age students from when the child is potty trained to kids taking their SATs to adults learning Mandarin. They even have water activities on weds and Fridays (weather permitting). I am happy to drop off my kid to school. My kid has learn how to speak basic Mandarin. There are lots of non asian children in school. Most teachers are bilangual. Lots of mixed asian children too. The school is very focus on safety. You need to be buzzed in to get into the building. Each parents sign in and sign out during pick up and drop off. We (including my mom who is a former teacher) checked out three different pre kindergarten for my child and felt this was the best one. We are happy we choice this school.\n",
      "Dedicated staff and a variety of teaching methods have helped with my daughter learn a lot in a short time. I wish we had gotten her in here sooner. The staff has always listened to our feedback. I feel the school provides exactly what they promise, and would keep her here full time if they went past Kindergarten.\n",
      "I really like this school for my son . He learn a lot here and he looks forward to come . The teachers are great and the rest of the staff . Thank you Las Vegas Chinese school\n",
      "I don't normally write reviews, but this place is just no good. The principle Cathy Endy is rude, I don't think someone like her can run a children's school. My son went there for a little bit, he didn't learn anything! What a waste of money.\n",
      "My kids have attended to this school for two years. The staffs and teachers are really helpful, especially to bilingual students. All teachers are fluent in Chinese and English. The school creates a great environment for kids to communicate and learn Chinese is a fun way. Besides education, the school always pays attention to students safety too. I love this school!\n",
      "The wife and I wanted to modernize our home theater system and clean up the cluttered look. We chose three businesses on the west side of town to start with. Elite A/V was the only business that could be bothered to qualify us as customers and after about an hour of talking A/V with Carmine and Jeremy we had three quotes THAT DAY! I needed to convert my old \"tube\" TV niche so I could hang the plasma on the wall. During this remodel project Elite A/V sent a team out to pull some new wired networking runs and they were able to complete this task in one day. A couple of return visits to patch up the holes and you can't tell they were ever here! The price was very reasonable and the job was finished quickly (much quicker than I expected) and professionally. We had asked Carmine to give us three quotes and a budget cap to work with and when Carmine told us we would have quotes same day I originally thought that was a bit optimistic since we met with them later in the afternoon...but sure enough after dinner I had quotes in my inbox. This is the kind of service we received from Elite A/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time. We decided to go with Martin Logan Eloctrostats and a Marantz receiver to replace our aging equipment and I will say it is impressive, the warmth, depth, and clarity is hard to imagine until you hear it. This was an A++ purchase at a reasonable price and we are one hundred percent satisfied. We are looking forward to our continued relationship with Elite A/V as their customer service and quality of service was unmatched by others we talked to during our remodel project. Five Stars from Robert and Stephanie\n",
      "FRANK.......MY Hats off too Jeremy at Elite AV. Following a no show twice in 48 hrs. by one of his competiors. I had no choice but to grab the ball and run. I went on line and after about 15 min of reasearch I chose Elite AV. Within 45 min. I had an Appointment set up for same day installation. Wow was I lucky. Jeremy showed up right on time and 4 hrs later my install was completed. During the process there were recomendations made to meet my needs, I went with all sugestions. I must add not one recomendation was made that did not make financial sense to achieve my needs.He never tride to upsell me or his services. Thanks for the honesty. Jeremy and team will now service all of my family and friends home theather/ security needs. Thanks young man...I wish you much sucess continue to do what your doing in the manner you are doing it dont loose focus, you cant miss. Frank....\n",
      "PLEASE use these guys! This has been the best experience for us! We found them on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) and from the very beginning they were on top of it. They were fast, efficient, courteous, and clean. But more importantly, they know what they are doing and are true experts in their field. We shopped a few companies before choosing this one and on top of everything else, they beat the other companies price! Very happy overall and will recommend them to everyone.\n",
      "NO MORE DEAD SPOTS! Thanks to Elite AV putting in an awesome Wi-Fi system in my house, every corner of my house has an awesome Wi-Fi signal that works perfect. It's just like having a Wi-Fi system in an office building but in my home!! so it's absolutely the best of the best in Wi-Fi and I couldn't be happier with what they've done!! Not to mention the install and set up that they installed in my closet looks amazing!! Truly an amazing installation it's not like that crappy job that the cable man does when they come to your house, by having Elite AV install your system your getting a professional custom install with the cooling fan system and rack all bolted to my walls exactly what you want you're home ! So you can only imagine how happy my houses when every TV in my house is streaming videos movies music and have no problem at all thank you elite AV for everything that you've done!! I recommend anybody who's looking for professional courteous awesome installation with great working Wi-Fi to use Elite AV !!\n",
      "I spent so much time reviewing projectors and screens that I never really thought about installation. I finally narrowed down my choice to Jeremy and his team and that turned out to be the best decision in the world! Jeremy came by to check out my loft and we brainstormed ideas for my home theater. He was very knowledgeable and left zero doubt in my mind that I'd picked the right company. Jeremy and his team got my projector ceiling mounted and my 110 inch screen up in no time. He threw in a video receiver and two ceiling mounted speakers to complete the perfect home theater for me and my family! He even installed a new outlet so I could hide the wires on my living room television when I asked last minute. That was icing on the cake that made a person like me who rarely writes, just reads reviews, make sure that I shared the experience I had with this company! A+ work\n",
      "From the initial meeting for a detailed quote with Carmine to the install and set up of my system with Jeremy (brilliant young man) and team. The experience was pleasant, great attention to detail and absolutely no damage to my home. The mess that was inevitable with any A/V install was meticulously cleaned up by the team. This company strives to be the best and will work with you regardless of your budget. I will stress however if you are looking for a superior system do not skimp with inferior components. True professionals and will spend the extra time to make sure you are completely satisfied with your system and truly understand the operation of your new system and control before leaving. Definitely 5 stars, will definitely use this company again when the situation arises. And\n",
      "Thank you, Finally an audio / video specialist company you can trust and thats not creepy. I was't even planning on putting a home theater system for my house until i talked to Jeremy, who was highly recommended by a close friend. Long story short he stopped by my house we did a walk through together and he really took his time to explain the different possible options we had based on quality of the products and my budget. He wasn't pushy and made me feel real comfortable. Next day i received an amazingly priced estimate and decided i was going to do it. Him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours. What made my experience even better was the fact that he was more than willing to teach me how to use my brand new pioneer receiver. All and all they made my life a lot more entertaining. I have to admit i did spent a bit more than i had initially planned but it was worth it. I will be calling them back for more stuff, highly A+++ recommended...\n",
      "I sent an email to Elite A/V LLC to see if they could give me an estimate to hook up a new blue ray, to an older home theater system and new tv. They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day. They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV. Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call. I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers. I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route. He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own. I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy. We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time. Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2 1/2 hours talking us through the whole process. They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue. The cost came to more than what I had intended to spend at the time but I am so glad that I went with their suggestion. The sound is fantastic, I don't think we will ever go out to see movies again. I would highly recommend Elite A/V LLC as I felt they were very honest in explaining our options and we did not feel pressured at all on the direction to go.\n",
      "Very disappointed. Less than 6 months after installation and setup, the cameras can no longer be viewed away from home.\n",
      "I needed the surround system for my house set up. Jeremy came in and evaluated the house. He made suggestions. Jeremy chose some great equipment that were the best bang for my buck. He was willing to work around my schedule for everything. Chris and Dillon came to install the equipment after the consultation. They were \"somewhat\" professional. No...they were great and easy to work with in the house. They cleaned up after themselves and did a fantastic job. Sometimes when strangers come into your house, it can become awkward. In this case, we cracked jokes and were able to still maintain an efficient time frame. They suggested some things for the future as well. I would recommend them hands down for any work. If all works out, I plan to use them for some automation.\n",
      "Jeremy and his company have always done fantastic work for me. Anything I dream up he can accomplish. I have used his company for several years and would never trust anyone else. He is the best!\n",
      "I am as picky as they come for A/V ascetics and performance. Elite came and mounted my tv on then when we didn't like the height they changed it without hesitation. The most professional team. We got an A/V rack, custom remotes, and everything worked perfectly and it was top notch equipment. We had them come a second time and the same performance. We had all the A/V companies come out for the bid and they don't hold a candle to Elite. Jeremy & Dylan are the best.\n",
      "Dylan and the rest of the team are true professionals. They are very knowledgeable and worked quick; they did three plasma tv/ receiver/ blu ray set-ups in one day (and one of those involved installing speakers into the ceiling via my attic crawl space). I'm very happy with the results.\n",
      "Great experience! Had 2 TVs and a sound bar installed. Great quality work! Jeremy, Dylan, and Chris are all very friendly and easy to work with. Highly recommend them!\n",
      "I have worked with Jeremy at Elite A/V numerous times he is very particular clean and does excellent work. They do everything at 100%, never cut corners, very knowledgeable, polite, and honest. I recommend them to anyone!!\n",
      "Just moved to town and my home theater system was still in moving boxes. I needed help and am very happy that I reached Jeremy at Elite. He arrived at the time promised and installed everything at a fair price. He and Dylan were more than professional and answered all by questions. When they were finished I was very pleased with my system and really noticed the improved sound with the suggestions that were made. I would not hesitate to recommend Jeremy and his team to any one who has a need for AV service.\n",
      "Chris and Jeremy are great. They installed a 4 camera system (with ability to run 8 total) in my home after my wife wouldn't stop nagging. The system is real nice. They installed two flush mount screens (about size of smaller computer monitor) in both my bedroom and family room area. The screens turn on and off with a switch, and run a constant 4 screen split view of all my cameras. The whole camera thing is silly to me if you aren't able to view them in a moments time when someone rings the bell, or if you hear something strange. Sure, everyone's able to look on their phones - but the monitors they put in are amazing. Full HD quality, and great picture. I had some minor issues with my first NVR. It would reset in the middle of the night, and when I woke up my screens in both living areas were reset. I called Chris and he was back the next day. It turned out there was a small update on the NVR that wasn't done prior to sending a small shipment of NVR's out. A new one was sent via the manufacturer, and we had a new unit installed 3 days later. Both very nice guys. Professional. Nice equipment. They take their shoes off. They pet the dog. All in all, good experience and have recommended them to a neighbor (after recent break-ins in the subdivision -- 3 in total).\n",
      "My Tech was Nestor, I had my new TV set up with receiver, 6 speaker surround sound, and my computer. Nestor was very knowledgeable, and his customer service was was excellent. The Gentleman who initially took my call (sorry I forgot his name) was also very knowledgeable, and professional. I will definitely recommend this company to anyone with A/V needs.\n",
      "Jeremy came to our house on time, took off his shoes (without being asked!), was incredibly patient and helpful (marked the buttons we need to push) as he reworked some things we tried to install. He also did quite a bit of troubleshooting and will be back to help us again (per our request) as we need him for more than just the first request (we had purchased a new receiver and couldn't seem to hook it up to the existing whole house speaker system). We now have music that plays through the house and it is wonderful (and precisely what we needed). Reasonable rates and someone we can trust to come back and help us with the next project.\n",
      "Had multiple items installed in my office and I couldn't be happier with the service and the wonderful team. Will be doing more business with Jeremy and Elite A/V! If you have a chance to get services from them TAKE IT!!! You will be glad you did!!!\n",
      "I am highly satisfied with the work Jeremy and his associate did at my house. I mounted a tv and needed someone to run the cables through the wall. It was a relatively small job and I was wondering if I could even find someone to do it. Just like the other reviewers mention, Jeremy quickly and politely answered my email. Within a week he had come to my house once, on time, knowledgeable and prepared to complete the job. He tested everything out and cleaned up and the installation looks great! I will use Elite again and will recommend them as well.\n",
      "Called from reviews on Yelp and could not have been more professional. Upgraded a 15 year old home theater and Jeremy gave me everything and more within my budget. In addition, Dillon and his team did an amazing job with install. My theater is like new thanks to these guys. Don't buy from anyone else. Go directly to them and they will get you the right products and install within your budget.\n",
      "Jeremy and team did a fantastic job installing several new cameras and moving some A/V equipment from my existing entertainment center into a media room. Everything is controlled with a single remote control. The work was done in a timely manner and very clean. That was my biggest fear...holes in walls, exposed wires, etc. They ran all cables through the canned lights in the ceiling on the 1st floor of a 2 story house. Very nice job. Highly recommended.\n",
      "i used these guys through angie's list.. extremely satisfied with their work.. had a tv mounted and wires hidden behind 2 tv's.. they didnt try to \"overcharge' for the materials i needed from them. (needed longer wires). jeremy could do the work with his eyes closed. they cleaned up everything after they were done... will definitely use them again when i need.\n",
      "These guys are the best! So helpful and so on the ball. They walked me through all of my options and let me pick the one that best fit me :) I totally recommend this company!\n",
      "Ok, I just had one of the best customer service experiences in my life! I called Elite A/V after reading the yelp reviews. I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible! Please use Elite A/V for any home theater needs you may have. I can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance.\n",
      "They came to install a TV and a huge white board in our office. Jeremy was very friendly and was a pleasure to be around. We had great conversation as he was hanging the items in our office. They were in and out and didn't take long at all. They kept everything clean and provided coverage for the ground to ensure easy clean up! The office looks awesome! Called to make payment and they were super friendly. Thanks Elite A/V LLC!\n",
      "I worked with Elite A/V to install sound system and surveillance cameras for commercial gym. Great experience. They made good recommendations, didn't try to screw me with equipment mark ups, and did quality work. A couple weeks after completing the job, I couldn't get a receiver to work right and they were still very responsive and came right over and fixed my problem. Professional and good value. I will definitely call them again for my next job.\n",
      "These guys are great! They mounted a 55 inch in a tough spot no problem. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I called 4 different places to get estimates for installing in ceiling speakers for a surround sound system. 2 of them were very high priced and out of my budget. It came down to Elite and another company. All of them were pleasant to speak to but Dylan with Elite really listened to me, worked with me on my budget and found something that I'm very satisfied with. I didn't need anything on the high end and had him install a 5.1 speaker system that fit right in my budget. Dylan called me the day before to confirm our appointment and also called me about an hour before arriving as well. As a business owner and service provider this is a practice that I find invaluable to both the customer and the vendor. Upon arrival he took great care in covering up all my furniture and electronics to insure a clean and complete install. He installed 8\" 5.1 speakers to my receiver for TV, Blu Ray and X Box which I absolutely love! He also hooked up my turntable. Everything was calibrated to my liking. Dylan even walked me through activating my sub-woofer which I accidentally shut off after he left. He also contacted me the next day to make sure I was satisfied. I appreciated his professional courtesy, work ethic and customer service. Great product and service at a great price installed by a customer service oriented company.\n",
      "I have to give it to these guys...they are awesome! Being I was working on a tight budget and having older audio equipment, Elite came to the rescue. I want to give a shout out to Dylan and Erik (along with his son), for the awesome job you all did for us. They were all very professional and the end result is great! Erik (and son) were thorough, explained things along the way and kept everything clean as they went. I would definitely recommend Elite A/V to anyone interested in having their audio/video professionally hooked up. Thanks again you guys, and keep up the good work.\n",
      "This Company is Amazing! I have worked with Jeremy & his Crew so many times. I cant get enough of these guys. TV's on the wall, speakers in the ceiling. They even got my PC set up as a Server so I can stream music & videos everywhere. Call them today or stop by their shop and say Hi!\n",
      "The Best Audio Video company I have ever experienced. They are LICENSED, BONDED, INSURED. These guys are Professional. Jeremy took my call and had his crew come over the same day! They diagnosed an existing custom home speaker system and mounted the TV's very quickly. The team was prepared, clean and respectful. They made sure they did not leave until the system worked perfect. They checked all the TV/Blue Ray/DVR settings to make it work the way I wanted. It is a large crew that can handle big or multiple jobs. Workmanship is really great. The wires were run in the wall on both applications. They have decades of experience!! Value: Their prices are very fair for the quality of work (Excellent)! I highly recommend Elite A/V LLC.\n",
      "I used amazon services to get connected for the Elite A/V team to mount my TV. They did an awesome job. The Elite A/V team were amazing. They were professional and courteous even removing the shoes upon entering the house and vacuuming a small amount of dust up when done. It was clear they took their time to measure everything out and assist in making suggestions on where to place the TV. For any future AV or home automation, I'll definitely give these guys a call.\n",
      "These guys are the best and they work fast too. They did a security camera install at our office and it came out just how we wanted. They were very fair with their estimate and did a great job in a timely manner. The camera system is awesome. I even have real time access from my iphone which they set up for me. (This is great when you want to see what your employees are doing while you're gone for lunch). Chris and Jeremy are both cool guys and will give it to you straight. I will use them again in the future.\n",
      "Jeremy and Maurice came to our home on 6/24/14 to clean up a mess of wires for our home theater and internet system that have been that way for several years. We have paid other techs to do the same job but the wires were still left in a mess. This time we finally found someone who knows how to do the job right. Jeremy and Maurice are coming back in a few months to change out the ceiling speakers with new larger and directional speakers and have given us other options for updating our 7 year old system. If you have any TV or Sound system issues call Elite no job is too big or too small. Great company.\n",
      "Great! I had been looking for a while for someone to mount my new television for me and everyone I found was either too pricey or just didn't seem professional enough. I spoke with Jeremy at Elite AV and he was kind enough to tell me over the phone which type of mounts I would need as well as what he sold in comparison to the retail stores. I trusted him merely from this phone call and when he came a few days later for an installation I knew I made the right choice! Very professional and very knowledgeable!! Thanks Jeremy!\n",
      "Jeremy was originally going to stop by and give me an estimate then he went ahead and mounted two tvs for me on the spot. He's very professional , competitively priced, and knows his stuff. I plan on using his company for my home theater installation as well once he finalizes the estimate.\n",
      "I got a great deal on a high end 12 camera security system but needed someone to the install and found Elite A/V LLC on Angies. I messaged them and Jeremy replied within 24 hours and we made an appointment for a walk around. Our place is single story with a large foot print at 3600 sq ft and I wanted full perimeter and entry coverage. We have vaulted ceilings in over half of the house, with very little attic space on that half so running cables is no walk in the park. Jeremy and his crew were always very polite and professional and I am very happy with the work they did, They did all the camera cabling, setup the dvr and did some upgrades to our 2gig alarm system. I feel I got a very fair price on the work that was done. I plan on adding 4 more cameras down the line and will definitely use them again.\n",
      "Decided to get a new 55\" TV installed in our bedroom and did a service request online on Sunday and woke up to the owners response on Monday morning that they would try to get to us the same day! The techs called at 8 am to let me know they would be there at 10 and they were actually there on time ready to rock with tools in hand. This really impressed me as most companies want to see the job and try the up sell dance 1st before unloading a thing from their truck! These guys knew they were there to work and were prepared to do just that! They were very neat and meticulous and got the TV up and running in no time. They explained everything and took the time to answer all of my questions. I would highly recommend Elite A/V to handle any of your audio video and home automation needs!! Thanks Jeremy and crew!!\n",
      "Very very pleased, Jeremy is very knowledgeable and they know their product well. Also, his crew was really nice every time when they came out to install their equipment. This company is completely professional, responsive, and attentive. I was so pleased that when they finished their job everyone cleaned up, and did not leave a mess.\n",
      "Been using Jeremy and his guys for some time now, very professional and very honest. Will be using him again very soon when I move into my new house. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I had to take a moment and brag on Jeremy! He is the MAN! His prices were very reasonable. He and his staff were quite professional and we punctual, I would definitely recommend him if you want a professionally installed system!\n",
      "Absolutely Fantastic. Jeremy was not only on time and friendly but the guy really knows his stuff. He went the extra mile but didn't nickle and dime me over everything. I'll definitely be telling everyone I know about Elite A/V\n",
      "Jeremy, Chris and Dylan did a great job. They are very professional and knowledgeable. Highly recommend them.\n",
      "Elite AV has done all my stereo equipment in my home, my hard and now my home theatre. I recommend them to all my friends. Jeremy and his team are quick, responsive and were able to get my home movie theatre in place in time for Christmas. They even stay late and show up any day. I haven't been happier with a tech service. A big Thank You to Elite AV Geoff Radcliffe\n",
      "Jeremy is the best - highly knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy and fair. Everything you could ask for in an A/V specialist! In addition, his team is extremely courteous and respectful when working in my home, and they pay incredible attention to detail. I highly recommend them!\n",
      "This review is a long time over due. I have dealt with Jeremy in the past. When he told me he was sending one of his guys out to check an issue I was having , I was a little reluctant because I am picky about who works on my system. Dylan showed up promptly and even contacted us prior to him showing up. He sold me on 2 universal remotes for my living room and my theater. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but after the amazing job Dylan did I feel like I should have paid more. My system works better than it ever has and above any expectations I could have imagined. He was very concerned with my needs and asked many questions to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm sorry it took so long to leave a review but I was just using my remote thinking how simple everything has become and felt the need to leave this review. So thank you very much Dylan and Jeremy. Job well done and more.\n",
      "Great job by the Elite AV team on setting up my 65\" 4K TV and receiver. In addition they also set up my XBox, Apple TV and DVD player and checked the surround sound speakers, wub woofer and center speakers to make sure everything was working right. I couldn't be happier with the care they showed to our home in set up and clean up. I was very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others.\n",
      "Jeremy is the best! He is super professional. His work is outstanding. He is current on all the new and latest technology out there. He always has a solution on how to update and improve any audio/visual stuff I have going on in my house His work is meticulous. He is neat with his wiring and labeling, making it easy and clear for anyone to understand how to operate anything he has put together. He is reliable. He is prompt with return phone calls, emails and appointments. I would confidently recommend Elite A/V!!!\n",
      "I hired Jeremy and his team to mount 26 TVs for a few commercial projects in Vegas and they did a wonderful job! They were professional, on time, and very reasonably priced. I would definitely use them again!\n",
      "From scheduling to installation day, everything went smoothly and as planned. This company is very professional and Jeremy and Chris were great in answering my questions, on behalf of my employer, for a surround sound installation in his home. They called prior to arriving, arrived on time and were prompt in setting up the system. Would recommend them to anyone.\n",
      "Not sure where to start with these guys as they did seem very interested in installing a camera system in my home, their sales rep that came out even appeared very knowledgeable about their craft. A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know.\n",
      "Why haven't I reviewed this guys sooner? They are awesome, excellent, professional and more! I had them come to my house to relocate some A/V wiring, and while they where here they spotted some wiring issues on my Home theater system and fixed them at no additional charge, they even went into my attic to re-route some wiring. They are so good, I hired them to do the complete system / network wiring for a company I work for!\n",
      "Read the reviews and were impressed, so I thought I would give them a try. I'm glad I did. They deserve the ratings and live up to their reputation. I was fortunate to remodel my home and could include them in the design of every room. They were patient all throughout the process. As with most all construction projects, change, change, change! They stuck it through and were able to accommodate the entire way. The prewire looked excellent. They thought ahead and made sure wires could be pulled easily through the attic by hanging them rather than laying them on top of the beams ( I thought that was worth mentioning). When we finally finished, they came to install all the fun stuff. All the equipment was placed in a professional rack. They even added LED's which gave it a nice touch! Most importantly, everything works like they advertised. My lights are programmed for scenes and just need a push of a single button. My automation system even reminds me to take out the trash. I'm living in the future thanks to Elite AV.\n",
      "Iam sitting here in my awesome home theater-man cave!!! Chris did a great job hooking up and wiring my place of Both entertainment and refuge!! The whole company from start to finish was very knowledgable, professional, experienced, fairly / competitively priced and cool to work with... I would highly recommend them for all your AUDIO VISUAL install needs!!!! This company gets 5 stars!!!! Now I will get back to my movie and popcorn!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I am blown away by how awesome these guys were!! They just left, and I couldn't wait to jump on and give them a rave review!! My new tv is installed perfectly, and I'm actually in a great mood despite waking up at 8:30 a.m. to let strangers into my home, thanks to their great attitudes, their polite efficiency, and their kindness. They were so pleasant and funny and helpful, and they left everything clean and saved me a whole mountain of trouble. I could not be happier!!!\n",
      "BOY YOU GOT IT. THEY ARE GOOD, FAST AND VERY PROFESSIONAL. We have 2 surround systems and several TVs that we have upgraded, added a sound bar outside and installed Rogu on all of them through out our home. Dylan and his team also installed a complete system with a TV in each of the bedrooms and in the living area (7 total big screen tvs ) and all the bells and whistles at our Air B & B. Everything works perfect and sounds outrageous. I can't tell you how HAPPY WE ARE!! IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF ANY AUDIO, VIDEO SYSTEM, OR INTERGRATION, DYLAN IS THE TECH YOU NEED TO CALL. We have had service done by others and we always have had problems. They would come and fix a problem, and we would end up with a different problem because of it and each time it cost us a lot of money. Not with Dylan and his team THEY GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. They actually give you a real phone number and are happy to answer any questions you may have. They show up on time and get right to work and even clean up after themselves. So Woohoo is right!!!!\n",
      "Dylan and Travis did a great job mounting my TV. Will 100 percent be using this company in the future.\n",
      "These guys are very professional they were on time everything was setup with perfection they even vacuum my floors as they were going! Fair an reasonable price I would highly recommend this company an iam a very very picky guy but they met all my expectations with flying colors so iam a happy customer thank alot u guys for my 135\" projector screen look like An AMC theater lol !!!!!!!\n",
      "Had Dylan and his crew come out to my place to install a TV Wall Mount and then had them come out again to install a set of in-wall and in-ceiling speakers. I love home theater and was very particular about how I wanted everything laid out. They were very patient and worked with me on making sure they mounted and installed everything exactly the way I wanted. My project required cutting and drilling in to my walls and they went too great lengths to protect all my furniture and equipment from the dust and debris while they worked. When they were done, they vacuumed up all the mess and made sure the furniture was carefully moved back. They do good work, take pride in what they do, and are very reasonable when it comes to cost of labor. Definitely will use again or recommend to others.\n",
      "This review is almost 2 years past due, but they did such a great job that I felt I still owed it to them. We needed an extra large TV mounted and were looking into having surround sound installed. They suggested a sound bar and booster instead of adding ceiling speakers which turned out to be more economical and it sounds incredible. We have had no issues at all and are very happy with the system. These guys were clean and efficient and fairly priced. We will not hesitate to use them if the need should arise in the future.\n",
      "Elite A/V did an amazing job installing two 65\" and two 55\" TVs in our new home. Jake came out and did a comprehensive analysis of what options were available which provided us with a great menu from which to choose how much we wanted to do. On the day of installation, the crew was here for most of the day. They were efficient, respectful, NEAT AND CLEAN, and did a superb job of installing and explaining what the myriad remotes were for. A special THANK YOU to Dylan - he stayed longer to get us signed up for and explain Roku, Pluto, etc. Since that day, I've texted Dylan with questions several times and he even called me at 8:00 at night to talk about an issue. He has always responded within 30 minutes and has always solved my problem. I cannot imagine ever, ever using anyone else for my a/v, sound, and entertainment needs! Thank you Dylan. Jake and the entire Elite Crew!!! Michele and Harold\n",
      "We can't give enough praise to Elite A/V. when we hired them(for TVs and wire system)we were skeptical. Because we didn't know anything about A/V system. But they(Jeremy and all team crew)were very honest & knowledgeable, professional. My Husband is very specific but they worked with us very friendly and we had great customer service. We were very Happy what we got from Elite A/V service. I highly recommend this company to all.\n",
      "Chris is a true mensch! He did a super professional install of a flat panel and promised me he would come back and make a minor adjustment when I requested a change. He did make that adjustment and without additional charge like he promised. Good quality and good service is a hard combo to find in vegas but this company has both!\n",
      "The ultimate professionals. Prompt and efficient. Highly knowledgable and courteous. Job well done!\n",
      "Jeremy is a great worker, very knowledgable and honest. Such quality work for the price too! I highly recommend Elite AV.\n",
      "This company is amazing. We have a small office near to them and they were able to understand and take care of all of our needs. We were looking for a camera system with remote viewing capability, an in-ceiling music system and an alarm system. They provided great equipment and expert solutions for all of our issues and worked within our budget. They were even able to tie into some of our existing components. We were impressed that the installation went quickly and smoothly. The mess from the installation was cleaned up so well, you would never have know anyone was there. All of the equipment works and sounds great. Jeremy and entire team at Elite AV were professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. They are truly experts in this field with a depth of understanding that I could not find anywhere else. Both the service and products they sell are all top notch. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for any type of audio, video or alarm system for their home or business.\n",
      "Jeremy did a fantastic job at a fair price and we have stellar sound in our home and our patios. On top of that we finally have a universal remote that actually works and with our Sonos receiver we can select multiple inputs and place select audio in select rooms or flood the home and patio with the same audio. No surprises and quality work. Let Jeremy show you how to accomplish your needs without breaking your bank!\n",
      "Couldn't be happier with the service from Elite. We first started with Tweeter years ago for our initial home theater setup. Then we went with Geek Squad. Still not satisfied, we turned to Yelp & found Elite A/V. We will not use anyone else. Jeremy was very helpful in our initial visit. We had him do a small job recently & couldn't have been more professional. Always on time; did what had been contracted & we couldn't be happier with the result. There's no way you can go wrong with Elite.\n",
      "Super professional! I bought a flatscreen tv from them and they were comparable to big-box retailers. Best part is they mounted it on the wall for half the cost of big-box retailer. We will use them for subsequent television needs!\n",
      "Jeremy and Chris are as good as as A/V installers can get and their guys are just as good! Professional, on time and really good to work with! They made the entire process fun. First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've \"been there and done that.\" They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation. Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether. This is why Elite is so great. My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away. They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear. If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake. They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable. They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was \"OK.\" Who does that? In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value. I would work with them again in a heart beat. Again, if you choose another company for your work - it's your mistake, don't say I didn't warn you! PS: When they make a recommendation, believe me - take it.\n",
      "These guys were Prompt, Punctual and Professional. Was able to get the job scheduled the next day and they finished my TV mounting w/in a few hours and did a clean job. Good job guys!\n",
      "I have been going to DT for over 5 years. For a dealership, I find they are pretty fair in the pricing and they do some extras, like wash your car for you. You can also have your scheduled maintenance (like oil changes/tire rotation) done on a Saturday - they are open until 4 pm. For those of us needing our cars during the week -- it works great. If you drop it off around noon - you can check out Dark Horse Coffee across the street, or Burger Shoppe, or Prohibition, also if you want Brunch there is Bonjour Brioche just up the street (great quiches and baguette!) Also, Toyota has a loyalty program now (no cost to enroll), and all your maintenance spend gets recorded, and you can use points towards service or other items. The time before this time my Oil change was free.\n",
      "I've used this dealer intermittently since 1999. They do repairs well the first time but have had mistakes the last few visits. A couple years ago they left the window down and soaked the back seats when washing it. There was no apology or warning when I picked it up. I had to buy garbage bags to carry passengers the next couple days so they could sit on them. This past visit for regular maintenance I Was called because there were a few light bulbs out. I said I would do it myself and I found them changed anyway and the $38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up. I was going to do it myself because I already had spare ones in the storage and it takes 3 minutes or less. I'm becoming very skeptical about any dealership in this city!!!!\n",
      "This sad excuse of a car dealership should either be shut down by Toyota or their manager should be fired. Has no one ever explained to these people that calls should be returned? I as well, have also caught them doing unnecessary work on my Camry. My new mechanic tells me it served me right going there!\n",
      "A few weeks ago received a letter from downtown toyota, saying that they're very interested in buying back my 2013 Prius c, I didn't think anything of it as I'm very happy with my car. So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car. I've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me. At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted. Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly, we talked for a while, still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable/pressured, we ended the talk and that was that. Before going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into, but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it. Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers. At the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate. Overall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going. The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed. From my understanding, the prius c/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up.\n",
      "I'd give these guys negative stars if I could. I took my car in to get two engine sensors replaced, and after diagnosis, they handed me an estimate of approx $4000. That's the price of a new engine! I proceeded to tell them no, took my car to a mechanic that I know and trust (Heffner's Toyota in Kitchener) , and found out that this is a tactic that dealers use to get you to buy a new car. I wouldn't trust these guys to fix a lawnmower engine in the future. Be forewarned, this dealership is not to be trusted.\n",
      "I went there once...now they keep calling me to remind be about service using a 'blocked number\" - what a waste of my time and minutes. No legit business calls customers with a blocked number.\n",
      "Adequate service if your car is under warrantee. My engine light has been on for a year. 3 visits (charged each time) they are still incapable of fixing it. Different excuse every time. Pretty expensive even for an oil change. Long wait times even for the most straightforward repairs. Not great at returning calls. There are better places unless you really want to get repairs at dealership. Not great service off warrantee. I think I'll find somewhere else for service. Suggest you do too.\n",
      "Dipped cone all the way! This location is tricky because it gets very busy in the evenings. Best route, don't go in the drive-thru, park your car and order inside. It's quicker and easier!\n",
      "Always amazing food and service. Love their chicken Parm sandwich. Their blizzards are awesome too.\n",
      "This place is literally the worst. Hopefully the got rid of the awful management, because the owner is actually sort of nice. I ordered ice cream and just got a sloppy mess and no apology.\n",
      "Very nice and new. Staff is always friendly but the drive thru is ridiculous. Two burgers and a diet soda and Im still sitting here 10 minutes after the fact? People have stuff to do. I could cook a meal at home in this time.\n",
      "Nothing special about this place, their ice cream is ok. On busy nights drive thru is insane and impossible to turn left out of here. Prices are high too. The employees are really nice and it is a clean store.\n",
      "I love this location! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, you just can't beat the $5 meal special.\n",
      "Upon my usual weekly jaunt down to the St. Lawrence market I found myself staring into a neatly tucked away Shoppers Drug Mart at the corner of Esplenade and Jarvis. A life sized Justin Bieber cut out (my 11 year old selfs secret fantasy), was strategically display in the front window of the Beauty Boutique along with his latest fragrance line to draw in any stray window shoppers ( of course I'm convincing myself it was really my subconscious wanting to escape the mere minus 30 weather outside) Walking in I certainly didn't expect to walk out with over $200 worth of cosmetics. Upon first entering I was greeted by a lovely tall, bubbly, blonde that not only looked but sounded like a Disney princess. She was quick to ask if I needed any help or if there was anything in particular I was looking for. When I assured her I was just \"browsing\" as us window shoppers do, she offered to give me a complimentary makeover. I have never been one to decline a little free pampering here and there so I quickly obliged making my self comfortable on a fancy black chair next to her. And so It began; a little Clarins Ever Matte foundation, followed by both Benefit blush in Coralista and Benefit They're Real mascara ( which might I add is probably the best mascara in the existence of mascaras), next was the Lise Watier lipstick in Evasion and to finish it off a spritz of Marc Jacobs new scent \"Dot\" ...vuala she held up a mirror to show me her finished canvas and ten minutes later I was standing at the check out. The customer service was great, the product knowledge of the associate was excellent, the sales pitch was well played, the free samples were an added bonus...oh and my fancy new picture beside the Justin Bieber cutout left my 11 year old self jumping up and down on the inside. If you are looking to buy cosmetic this is the place to visit.\n",
      "A decent sized Shoppers Drugmart which has a full service pharmacy and has groceries as well. They recently added as small meat and fresh vegetable section . It is clean and the staff are friendly. The only thing I would change is the hours it should be open 24 hours, being located downtown.\n",
      "Large, beautiful and clean beauty boutique with brands that aren't typically found in Shoppers!\n",
      "I'm not sure what's wrong with the photo printer at this location, but my passport photos came out spotty and washed out. It's 15$ for 2 so they better be good! The rest of the store is just a regular shoppers like any other. Sometimes they do samples.\n",
      "i wanted to write a note about the great service I had recently at this location. I went in looking for makeup products and I am not really knowledgable in that regard but the Cosmetic Attendant (bright red/orange hair) was great. She came right over and asked if we needed help, she pointed out quality products and could tell me all about them. She saved me so much time and effort! Thanks again!\n",
      "This is the latest addition to feed my Shoppers Drug Mart addiction. I strolled in laden down with groceries on the opening day, looking like a vagrant, but was treated like a red carpet worthy customer. I was served by Maxine, the beauty manager, and she was simply lovely. Very sweet, knowledgeable, sense of humour and not at all pushy. I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket. The store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in. You have to scoot by the Beauty Boutique to get to the main part which is pretty sneaky. It's so hard to resist all those shiny, colourful (and expensive) things. It's a well stocked Beauty Boutique too with the usual Lancome, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden etc as well as Lise Watier, Benefit etc. The rest of the store is sparkling (well, it is new) and full of the usual mixture of a few groceries, medications, cosmetics etc. Staff were genuinely pleasant and everybody seemed happy to be there. This one is a keeper. I'll definitely be adding it to my list of places to spend money!\n",
      "This has been my go to dentist office for years. I absolutely love it. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The dentist are all amazing and very gentle. I had two teeth pulled on a Monday evening and was back at work on Tuesday working with no swelling or pain.\n",
      "Kudos to Vogel & Matesi and specifically to assistant Sally and Dr. Savla. I was traveling to Phoenix and was in tremendous pain. Not only were they able to fit me in their busy schedule, they did the first stage of root canal very quickly and professionally, the pain was gone right after! Thank you guys!\n",
      "Dental Horror Stories Not Found Here I know of: A mother tells a dentist to drill and fill anything on her children so she can show high expenses for a legal settlement. Pull anything with a cavity for Native American patients visiting Public Health Services in the 1960's. After my military entry physical the dentist proposed filling 7 teeth immediately. I skipped the offer. During my military exit physical four years later four fillings were offered. I accepted two, skipped two and had no more cavities/fillings for a decade. A California reconstructive dentist building a crown for me rained me with a shower of things I MUST do NOW. None inexpensive. Dr. Vogel has been balanced regarding my dentistry. His staff have kept my teeth clean and healthy 12+ years. When we get to dental requirements not in his lane, he's made excellent referrals to an endodontist and an oral surgeon.\n",
      "I am an Arizona native but have never seen the beauty of our state like this - from a float plane! We took off from the Scottsdale Air-park with our friends in the Desert Splash Adventures Cessna Caravan Sea Plane. The plane holds 9. For the next hour and a half, we flew through all of the canyons along the \"Apache Air Trail\" as the pilot called it. The pilot, Carl, is a 3rd generation pilot from Alaska and does a great job providing the history of the area along with some humor. You get to see all of the bridges and dams along the way. The best part of the trip for me was the water landing on Lake Roosevelt. Never done that before! After takeoff we then flew past ancient Indian cliff ruins, Weaver's Needle and the Superstitions before returning to Scottsdale. What a fun time. I maxed out the memory card in my camera but plan to do this again. They have powered kayaks you can use on Roosevelt that I want to try on the next trip.\n",
      "A float plane in the desert? What?! This is the best deal ever in Arizona! The Apache Trail Tour starts at Scottsdale airport and flies you all over the Valley. Pilot Rob really knows his stuff and is a great narrator when it comes to the history of the area and what you're seeing out of your windows. Splash landing!! But not bouncy. The touchdown on Roosevelt Lake was so smooth I actually couldn't tell when we landed on the water. After taxiing to the shore we were able to get out and explore for a while. The total time was two hours. This is a great tour for all ages. The kids had a blast and we had four generations on our plane. Everybody loved it! They do private parties and brunches on the lake as well. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "I cannot say enough wonderful things about this experience. We bid on this for a charity and had no expectations. We've lived in Arizona for a long time and had no idea how gorgeous our state could be. I'm not a fan of small planes but this was so easy and gorgeous. Great people, gorgeous surroundings, and amazing food. This is a can't miss Arizona experience!!\n",
      "I got this ride as a christmas gift but put off doing it until the gift nearly expired. I'm a private pilot and I've flown through the Superstition mountains a few times(though I never landed on the water) so it kind of didn't seem all that exciting to me. Boy was I wrong! Rob, the pilot, gave me a new appreciation for flying that route. Its a great and exciting way to see the canyons and lakes of the east valley and do something few people ever experience. If you think you've seen it all around here, check out this tour.\n",
      "Wished it was better.. After watching man vs. food I decided to stop by, décor was not that homey and welcoming, and the neighborhood was bad, but nothing I haven't been around before. The ribs were very fatty and grisly, it was disappointing and I didn't get enough sauce and when I asked for a little more they wanted to charge me, the coleslaw was awesome! I noticed a hair in my food and it turned me off to the rest of it, so i threw it away , I wont be returning... sorry guys\n",
      "Decor and service leave much to be desired, but the food is worthy of 4.5 stars. I've eaten at both locations several times now over the past year, since moving from San Diego, and I think the food is very good. The fried chicken and Polish Boy in particular are awesome. The ribs are just average. good sauce, but not super tender and have not been smoked enough for my taste.\n",
      "My husband and I ate here tonight for the first time and it will NOT be our last! The fried chicken is best I've ever had and my ppl are from South Carolina! His sauce is very very good! And the owner was very hospitable and spoke to us about the history of this famous restaurant. They will be taping on Rachel Ray's show next week! Kudos y'all!\n",
      "Don't believe the hype. Nooooo! In the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. Granted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. G Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). The fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers. The buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. The sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). It isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. The service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. Sort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. I'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).\n",
      "Don't believe the hype! After seeing this location on Man vs Food I had to check it out for myself. I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. The place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also. The employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. It took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while. The chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes. I'd much rather go to Zanzibar for their delicious honey fried chicken. Hell, I'll eeven take Church's Chicken instead!\n",
      "Sauce spicy and blan absolutely no flavor the decor screams dont eat here plus the entire staff is moody not to mention chicken wings are 1.50 a piece a true rip off!\n",
      "Seti's truck wasn't around so we decided to head to a restaurant with polish boys that didn't have wheels. I'm really glad we did that - the combo of the polish...girl...was delicious! It had the added pulled pork on it, the combo of flavors, perfect. What the fam really loved was that sauce. I'll probably never be in Cleveland again, but I'll dream of that sauce. We got the fried chicken, stuck the sauce on the side...but I can see why people just have it drenching that chicken. Glad we did get it on the side, though, since it was glorious to dip everything into it. Almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce.\n",
      "The location on 79th Carnegie, is a hot ghetto mess. I am ashamed of what the establishment has turned into. Maybe I'll try out superior or Lee rd.\n",
      "Let me just start by saying that this place did not live up to the Man V. Food hype. I think I have been to better buffets before. Terrible customer service earned them one out five stars. Extremely rude and inconsiderate server. Took us ten minutes to place our order when at the front of the line. She decided to have side conversations while we were still ordering. Food: I ordered the Polish Boy and Dark Meat Chicken. Polish Boy: Polish Sausage, Coleslaw, Fries, and BBQ sauce on a bun. It was drenched in sauce, making the bun soggy. It was not bad but was not all that. The sauce is not very good for BBQ. It is runny like Open Pit and has a little zing to it. Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible. Chicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I enjoyed this part of the meal. Overall, I would not return. No place should treat their guests with such arrogance and ineptness. I think I would rather take my money to Popeye's, its most comparable match.\n",
      "I love Hot Sauce Wiliams. Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss. Though HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ. Where HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods. For drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer Though I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now. If I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed. If you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment.\n",
      "The food was okay. The wings and fries were not that fresh and very little chicken came on the bone. The sauce was ok. I like Open Pit Bar B Que's (Cleveland, OH) sauce better because it's sweeter. I tried this because it was on the travel channel. It really wasn't that good. I like Harold's Chicken Shack in Atlanta and Chicago way better when it comes to chicken and sauce.\n",
      "Best fried chicken out there. Skip the hot sauce, it isn't hot, and is frankly pretty disgusting. The various sides on offer are mediocre. There is a high likelihood of there being no food in the restaurant, especially later in the day, so call before going. Seems like it's takeout only in spite of having a large restaurant space.\n",
      "1st time visitor. Portions were great and the personable service really gave it that home feel. Had the Rib Tip....my oh my, shut my mouth. What was that devine creation? Go get you some now! Good food + nice price = great atomphsere. Enjoyed learning their history via the cook during her lunch break. You know if Samuel Jackson and Charlie Sheen dine there it's gotta be good.\n",
      "Hot Sauce Williams has some pretty poor BBQ, mediocre fried chicken, and an odd sauce that they'll put on either one. Of course then there's the polish boy. I'll explain. This place has become a Cleveland landmark, probably more from visits of Anthony Bourdain and ManVFood than anything else. There are a number of similar spots in Cleveland and you have to respect it for what it is. It's not the kind of place that's trying to win competitions here. It's more of a fast-food style cheap BBQ. On our most recent visit we got a polish boy and some fried chicken. A polish boy is a kielbasa, fries, coleslaw, and sauce on a bun. It's an unrefined mess and it's pretty tasty. In my opinion their chicken is so-so. The service seems to be down to business. I wouldn't describe my experiences as overly friendly. If you're an out-of towner I suggest trying it for what it is. The polish boy is uniquely Cleveland. The neighborhood is characteristic for much of the east side of the city. It may not be pretty but it is what it is.\n",
      "Despite being slathered in their sauce, this fried chicken surprisingly maintains its crispiness and isn't the least bit overpowered by the flavors of the sauce. Actually, the sauce compliments the chicken so well that it had me asking for more- I even bought a bottle of their original sauce for the road since we were just visiting Cleveland. Of the two sides that were ordered, the mac n cheese tastes similar to a homemade baked dish packed with cheesy goodness. The fried okra was decent, but was coated in so much batter that I could barely taste the okra. In addition to the good food, the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to Hot Sauce Williams\n",
      "I can't remember the last time I ate here because it has been that long. Well it will be my last... The menu on Yelp quotes one price so a slab dinner 19.95 when I pick up my food it's $29. The girl at the register rude even when you call in to order tone very dry... Food over I should have saved myself the trouble and gas and just pulled out my own grill!\n",
      "I'm going to keep my review short and sweet! Polish Boy and the wings, OFF THE CHAIN! Nuff siad!\n",
      "Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland tradition! I will always stop here for the fries with sauce!\n",
      "hot sauce williams is amazing, but it is certainly not a place to go for a low calorie meal. fried chicken, st. louis style ribs, mac n cheese, sweet potato pie, etc. it's all awesome. the fried chicken is done perfectly! my mouth waters just thinking of this place. its a simple place, you order from a counter and can either take your food to go or eat it there. all that matters is the food is killer!\n",
      "I've been going to Hot Sauce Williams for the past 15 years and this place is going down hill big time! The service continues to get worse and the attitude of the workers is piss poor. They ignore you and can be very rude as well. Also, the place is very dirty and I would love to see the health inspection report. I will admit there Sauce is some of the best I have ever had. The wings are just not as good as they used too, but the Polish Boy is still very good. The Mac n Cheese is very overrated and DO NOT ORDER THE RIBS. They are like chowing down on a gristled piece of fat and that has the texture of rubber. My friend tossed them away they were so bad. Very sad to see an Cleveland Institution goes down the tubes like this and hope they can improve but that's the last they have seen of my business. P.S-Don't even bother going through the drive thru unless you have 20 mins to spare, no joke.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I been dying to try this place for sometime, but never found the motivation to go until we saw the Anthony Bourdain episode when he was in Cleveland. We ordered the Family Meal (Full Slab, 8 Pcs of Chicken and 2 sides). When we ordered most of the sides were not available so our choices were limited. I've seen their slogan around town \"Voted #1 for Ribs\" so we were excited, but after taking our first bite into those saucy ribs, we looked at each other and said \"meh\" as we have had better. The chicken on the other hand, drenched in BBQ sauce, was interesting. It was saucy yet crispy so it was an interesting dish, we probably favor the chicken over the ribs. The family meal is large so make sure you have plenty of mouths to feed, as for us we'll need to hit the gym for the next several days to burn off the calories we just packed on.\n",
      "Worst food I've ever had the laziest service. We ended up throwing 35 dollars in the trash. If you like getting sick or experience all time lows check this place out!\n",
      "Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland institution... Put in other words- you have to try this place at least once. The sauce isn't for everyone. It's a vinegar based sauce with a little heat to it. I absolutely LOVE it but I know others who prefer a thicker sauce. I normally go with the 2 piece all white dinner with the sauce on everything. The fried chicken is some of the best in Cleveland. The fries, slaw and bread are all solid and for what you pay ($6.99 for my meal) you get a ton of food. The inside of the restaurant is very old school-- definitely not a place for suits and ties. It has a drive thru which is super convenient, especially considering the area it is in.\n",
      "My good friend, a native Clevelander, described this spot as a Cleveland staple. In town for a Cavs game & we gave it a try! My BF & friend had the pork shoulder & it looked great. They loved it, I tried it & wished I ordered it. It's on white bread & looks a little mysterious but it's delish. I ordered the chicken ...I waited....& waited for this stupid chicken. My friends & BF were done eating by the time I got my chicken *sigh* not cool. Luckily I got my sides first which were mac n cheese (dry and tasteless) and greens (ok). I was so excited for this place & what a bummer. The chicken was juicy but had no flavor. I am a white girl that grew up in Pittsburgh, I'm not asking for much in terms of flavor but my God this was tasteless. Let's touch on the location, def off the beaten path. I felt as if I were at a fire hall. The decor reminded me of a low budget bridal shower. It's positively outdated which is fine, it's a dive. I wish the food made up for the detoured drive, long wait & weird set up.\n",
      "Pretty solid / cheap chow. But not BBQ Line moved fairly slow but i didn't expect fast food. Staff was polite and playful I ordered the chicken/ribs combo. ($10) -The chicken was pretty tasty, but the sauce poured all over it made it instantly soggy. -the ribs are smoked/grilled then BAKED. that said they had good flavor and texture. -the sauce is just plain not good. tastes like sweetened tomato juice. it worked okay on the ribs but ruined the chicken. -mac n cheese is meh -greens are cooked sweet. not my style. Def work a quick meal if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way.\n",
      "The polish girl was good overall but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. The fried chicken was also a plus.\n",
      "I have been going here for at long time and its one of few places I can overlook bad service because I love the food. The wings are great, best wings in Cleveland but the best offering from here is the barbeque sauce. Better service and it would be 5 stars.\n",
      "I like to do Man vs. Food tours whenever I visit a city for work, and while planning for Cleveland, Hot Sauce Williams and their Polish Boy definitely made it onto my list of must eats. Man oh man, it did not disappoint. That Polish Boy is AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of your typical hotdog with coleslaw, not so much hot sauce or putting fries on things. But I'm telling you, this thing is spot on! The hot sauce wasn't too hot, the fries melded together with everything else in a special and tasty way, and the slaw and kielbasa were delicious. You have to try it if you get the chance. No wonder it's a signature Cleveland food. I did do the drive thru (after reading other reviews this white girl didn't want to risk going inside by herself late on a Saturday night) but didn't have any issue with a long wait - maybe 3 minutes tops. Glad there were no harassing panhandlers around either. I was bummed they were out of banana pudding but the strawberry cheesecake was ok. Bottom line: go get yourself a Polish Boy!\n",
      "All I can say is that both the food and the restaurant were completely disgusting. The pork shoulder tasted like it was two weeks old and reheated in a microwave. Their fries were cold and mushy. The cole slaw was the only edible thing they gave me. The whole meal was so bad I threw it in garbage after two bites. To go along with the terrible food the inside of the restaurant was dirty and had a strange smell. It's probably not necessary to say, but I will never set foot in Hot Sauce Williams again.\n",
      "Hot Sauce Williams takes the best BBQ in Cleveland in my option. The home made mac and cheese is astonishing. The chicken is drenched in sauce and you just have to saver the flavor. I love to lick my fingers clean to finish off my meal.\n",
      "Painful to watch this slow disorganized mess try to handle just a few orders at once. Took 30 minutes to get our food and that was because we accepted other chicken pieces than what we ordered because they said it would take longer. Short story long: if you're in a hurry this isn't the place for you. On a positive note; the ribs were very good even with a little too much of their hot sauce on them. But the ribs weren't incredibly meaty. The chicken was nicely fried, but they put a bit too much hot sauce on it. The fries and mac and cheese were good with the hot sauce. An odd mix resulting in a 3 star experience\n",
      "The chicken isn't what makes this place great. It's good but it becomes something different entirely when you smother it in the signature sweet, juicy sauce. My God, I'd smother my limbs in this and eat my own arms. It's that good. Get that and some of the mac n cheese and you're in heart attack heaven. But it's so good you won't care! Also, all this crap about \"Oh i might get shot\" or \"Don't venture here at night\". This is Cleveland, kids. It's rough. But I'd rather venture into a rough neighborhood than spend my time kickin' it at Applebee's in the safety and comfort of some designed suburb eating crap ass Jack Daniel glazed \"riblets.\" Do yourself a favor, venture out of your comfort zone and get some good chicken...and extra sauce You'll be super happy you did.\n",
      "This is probably going to be one of my favorite places that I stopped at on my cross-country trip...thanks yelpers for letting me know it's worth going to the shadier part of cleveland (which isn't THAT bad) to get my grub on. The two things you have to get when you go to this joint are the macaroni and cheese (my husband says it's the best he ever had and he's a snob when it comes to fatty foods) and the fried chicken (this was so juicy and flavorful on this inside and deliciously crispy on the outside). OMG, seriously run there is you have the privilege of being in Cleveland. Oh, and a few other pointers: Cornbread was not good at all. I didn't try the coleslaw because it was super lathered in mayo. We also had the pulled pork sandwich, which was really good too. The bbq sauce is flavorful, but not hot at all. I liked it on the pork, but I'm glad I didn't get the fried chicken drenched in the sauce - better on its own.\n",
      "I know others have been moaning about their service, but our experience last Sunday was great. We were disappointed about the dining room being closed, but the drive through was open and the staff were very patient with our endless debate about what to order (our son can be finicky). They even chimed in with recommendations when they told us that Fried Okra was unavailable. The food was incredible -- and really messy in the car as we scarfed it down on our way back to NYC. We had Polish Girls, Mac and Cheese, Black-Eyed Peas and a Pork Shoulder sandwich. The sauce is really special. We strongly recommend it to everyone. Great food, great service, really cheap.\n",
      "This is a funny place. Being from Youngstown, and not Cleveland, I went here after my Cleveland Clinic appointment, because I saw this place on Man vs Food. I went there for one reason only...the Polish Boy. The service staff was really under-enthused to wait on me...even though I was only 1 of 4 people in the whole joint. The 1st lady who I said hi to pointed me in the direction of the stack of paper menus, without saying anything back to me. The Polish Boy, was not on it. But after asking the lady at the counter, they DO still have it available. It's a kielbasa on a bun, topped with fries, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce. The TV show also added pork shoulder to the sandwich, but for some reason, they didn't put it on mine. It was awesome nonetheless. The place was a dive, doesn't look that clean, and it's located in a not-so-great side of town, and the service was lacking any personality. However, the Polish Boy was GREAT. I would definitely have this again. I hear their other food is good too, but the PB is all I wanted. 3 stars for the food. 0 stars for the service. Letter Grade: B\n",
      "I wont lie.. I was a little scared to enter this restaurant. I have always wanted to eat here but the location on Lee has a horrible reputation for .. well if haven't heard.. picture the scene from Animal house when they all walk into the bar where Otis is playing.. Nuf said. I had heard that Man Vs Food was at this location, so i figured i would give it a shot. Upon entering most places the food network has been you will notice that not only do the places raise their prices, but pictures and plaques are everywhere commemorating the event. Had you not seen the episode, you would never know they had been there.. Its as if they couldn't have cared less.. So i asked the girl.. \"Whats good\" and with out even hesitation she fires back \"You gotta try the polish girl and you might as well have the fried chicken too..\" With that type of certainty.. i had to reply \"Well. OK!\" She then asked me \"You want our sauce on your chicken?\" To which i asked \" I dont know, do i?\" She promptly said yes and ladled it on. For those who dont know.. A polish girl is a sausage (hot dog like) on a bun with french fries, pulled pork, coleslaw and their sauce.. Its about as good of a sandwich as you will ever taste. Now fellow Yelpers.. I have been known to exaggerate a little to heighten the effectiveness and entertainment value of a good story.. But i say to you today.... That is the best fried chicken that has ever passed my lips. The very wise and helpful woman who took my order was appreciated ever time i took a bite of that chicken. That sauce.. complimenting an already outstanding chicken breast.. I well up with tears just thinking about how unbelievably good that food was. On another note.. Buy a F*cking mop already.. The place is absolutely deplorable. I needed rubber gloves and a hasmat suit to enter the place. Seriously... what is that 10 years of grime on the molding? Its absolutely disgusting. How you havent been sited is beyond me.. Perhaps people are so blinded by the food (as i was) that they don't notice or care. You would have had 5 stars, but i just couldn't get over how dirty it was..\n",
      "I had always seen this place growing up, but I never actually tried it until this past Christmas! The fried chicken was probably the best I have ever had; worth every calorie! I had the sweet potato fries and they were great and crispy. Everyone was really nice; the cook even came out and took a photo with us when I told him that I was visiting and had always wanted to try the place! I will definitely be coming back!\n",
      "Um, can I just say that I want another 15 orders? This stuff is so so delicious. It has had rave reviews from all sorts of TV shows and I had to try. So last night, after a full weekend of eating, I decided I could just put on some super loose eating pants and go and get my fill. We ordered the rib tip meal and the thigh snack. The rib tips were well cooked and the SAUCE! That is the winning ingredient. The ribs themselves were a little bit tough at times, but that sauce is really what makes your mouth water. We also got the macaroni and cheese as a side and as a not usual fan of mac and cheese (I KNOW, I'm the devil for saying such ludicrous things) I wasn't expecting to finish the ENTIRE tub by myself. My boyfriend wished he acted faster, because he just got a small taste. What you have to be careful about when you go late at night is that they close the doors and you have to order in the drive through. The intercom doesn't work so you drive up to the window and order. They take about 5 to 8 minutes to get your order. During that time, there will be homeless people that approach you. If that's not your scene, you won't score some awesome ribs. The environment its in is not great, but the food will surely make you want to come back.\n",
      "Forget about the place and service (which were fine) and let's talk about the food! The Polish Boy was good, but the fried chicken was AMAZING!! And the sauce was killer!\n",
      "So torn. I love their food. We wanted a polish boy. Yelp says open until 1:30, it is 10:26 pm and drive thru dude says they're closed. What? If you're normal and visit during normal hours, I gave hsw 5 plus stars. But consistence is nice too.\n",
      "The chicken and po boy was amazing. Possibly the best I ever had. Get it with the sauce loaded on the chicken and fries. Staff was super friendly. I will come back next time I am in the neighborhood I visited because it wAs a nice walk from the Cleveland clinic. Probably not the best idea at night but during the day it was great.\n",
      "The food is good but the service is slow. This means do not go there for a quick to go food. I ordered a side of \"mac and cheese\" and fries. The \"mac and cheese\" was already prepared but it took them 20 minutes to get my fries. There was no sense of urgency amongst the entire staff, they just assumed everybody came to spend their entire day in the restaurant waiting for food.\n",
      "Hot Sauce Williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine :) My favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner. For sides, I get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. They give you sooooo much food for just under $12! The servers work only behind the food stand, so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself. You may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness, but the food is so worth it! One thing to keep in mind, they don't provide free water, but a bottle of water is only $1. Definitely worth checking out!\n",
      "Loved this spot! I got the pork plate which is shoulder with slaw and bread covered in sauce. Came with fries that I had them add sauce to. Just amazing. I've had bbq so many ways and I appreciated how unique and delicious this spot was!\n",
      "I went here on my lunch break and I waited for 20 minutes just for a polish boy! It was pretty good but waiting for the very slow and rude staff was frustrating.\n",
      "My son and I stopped here on our way home from vacation. I wanted a polish boy, but Seti's is closed on weekends. This place had a good rep for theirs. I had the polish girl (polish boy with pork shoulder). It was tasty, but didn't think its size justified its price. Paid over $9 for something noticeably smaller than a regular hot dog. Yeah, it had fries and a can of soda, but still.....The sauce was good, but don't expect it to be hot. We waited a long time in an empty restaurant for anyone to come up to the counter to take our order. She saw us, but kept wandering around not really doing anything. Seemed like they were out of everything. No chicken sandwich, no corn fritters, no fried chicken breasts, and a few other things the people behind us ordered. The woman taking our order acted like we were bothering her and that she was doing us a huge favor by doing her job. There was a cheap boom box blaring awful music you coudn't get away from no matter where you sat. I don't care one way or the other about decor, but if you do, don't go here. Table cloths look like cheap shower curtains a 4yr old picked out, and there is a cheap entertainment center in the dinning room. Who puts an entertainment center in the middle of a restaurant, lol? All in all, the food tasted good, but wasn't the best value, the service was crap, and the decor was laughable.\n",
      "If you don't like this place, chances are you don't know what good barbeque is. I had the rib tip dinner (Off menu btw). This is a good alternative to the full rib dinner. It is still a ton of food, but not quite as much! The sauce is delicious. As of 27 Feb 2011, you get a free plastic Pepsi 'Courtesy Cup' if you buy any one of their sodas. Yes it's dirty, informal and right in the middle of an extremely sketchy neighborhood. IMO Cleveland needs more places like this. There are way too many places that wish with all of their might to be located in Manhattan or LA. Guess what? You're in Cleveland. Now ditch the valet and the uppity atmosphere, and give me some food.\n",
      "Where do I start....My family & I went here on Saturday night and ordered 2-4 piece chicken dinners & 1-2 piece chicken dinner. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait!!! The chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh, drumstick coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about heaven!!!! You can get the sauce on the side though if you're not too adventurous. Now the service, that's another story. Let me just say they need a tutorial on customer service. I'm a person who believes in second chances, so we tried this place again on Sunday and the service was the same....The only thing that changed was the table cloths?.....The reason why I gave this place a 4 star is because of the food but the service could use a lot of upgrading!!! I would suggest that you call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food, it's like watchin' paint dry!!\n",
      "oh God....I think this may be my first review where I add the tag line \"for Cleveland\"....I'm so sorry that I have to use it here... So, this is decent BBQ....for Cleveland. Decided to commemorate MLK Day and a former Yelper by patronizing Hot Sauce Williams. We had both been wanting BBQ all day long and figured today was just a good a day as any to give it a shot. Reading the previous reviews, I found it quite funny that we wound up getting the exact same thing as Amy T. and her dining partner! Ribs, coleslaw and fries for me...4 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese and fries for my gluttonous dining partner ;o) But, getting to the point of ordering was an ordeal in itself! We walked in and there were no menus posted....looking around for a couple of minutes, I was almost ready to go up to the girl behind the counter and ask her \"so, what do you think we should get\"...but I was kind of afraid to do that because of the response I envisioned in my head *cringe*. So, I was pretty thankful when we finally looked around and found some printed up menus of their offerings....but, in what kind of order did they put these things? There was no rhyme or reason to half of the menu, very confusing. Ordering was an event in itself, I started ordering with one girl and then she just walked away in the middle of my order, and then another chick came up and kind of finished it....I mean, I agree with Stef C. on this one, would it kill you to put a smile on your face and actually act like you enjoy getting paid?? Pluses, it was cheap, and it was fast, we had our food in less than 5 minutes and were out the door to enjoy it at home. Portions were HUGE, holy crap you could feed a family of four on the two dinners we ordered, neither of us could finish our meals. Sauce was decent, ribs were a little grisly, chicken was pretty good....but in all reality, eating BBQ in Texas and Georgia has ruined me. HSW is decent BBQ, for Cleveland.....this place would be out of business so fast in any of the Southern states due to the attitude you receive behind the counter and for the simple fact that it's just not that great when compared to some of the great BBQ places around the country. Let's just say I think my BBQ craving is over until summer comes around and all the Yelpers can get together and do a proper cookout.\n",
      "There is a lot of buzz about this place, especially given its feature on the Food Network. Having lived in New Orleans for some time, I was both curious and eager to give HSW a try. (New Orleans is famous for some of its fried/comfort foods.) The Bottom Line: this place is rather magical. If you love fried food that is slathered in hot sauce, then this is your place. To be honest, the fried food offers a one-dimensional taste experience; however, the food presentation is beautiful...in an ordered-chaos sort of way. There's a menu, but you pretty much just get whatever they have available (I.e., whatever is sitting in the warmers behind the counter). I tried the fried chicken and the famous Polish Boy sandwich -- a fried kielbasa topped with coleslaw, fries, and hot sauce. I also \"sauced\" everything, allowing the kind worker to paint all of my food with the ever-so-sweet-tangy-and-delicious HSW hot sauce. The food was hot, and amazingly, the chicken was as crispy/tasty as some of the famous fried chicken of New Orleans' Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase. (Huge success!) The decor is the best part of HSW. The restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes. While this may seem to be a negative, it is not. These details, coupled with the ambiance of the restaurant's neighborhood, offer the adventurous and hungry an authentic City of Cleveland dining experience. Grade: A\n",
      "Decided that I had to check this place out since I am a huge fan of Adam Richman and he featured it on Man vs Food. He also wrote a section on Cleveland in his book, 'America the Edible', and he name drops this spot. My fiancee and I were not disappointed, it definitely hit the spot. I loved the sauce. Ryan tried the Polish Boy which basically a kielbasa, with sauce, and cole slaw piled on top. The french fries are smushed in on the side, but definitely a tasty experience overall. I heard that the wait on the ribs was 30 minutes so I opted for their fried chicken which was crunchy greasy goodness. For a fairly quick bite I definitely recommend checking this place out.\n",
      "Came here on Saturday evening and there was a line about 10 people in front of me. I ordered a 3 pieces white dinner and was expected to get my food within 10-15 mins; however it took me about more than half hour to get the food. It's fair to say that efficiency was not their priority. Despite the service the food was absolutely amazing. Great value with great taste. The chicken breasts were tender and not too oily. The sauce was top natch.\n",
      "Solid BBQ spot- definitely recommend! Pros: Reasonably priced and delicious. Cons: Food was pre-prepared and clearly sitting out a while before we got there. The taste and flavor are outstanding! I kept it simple and ordered Ribs and fries. Sauce had me like \"mmmmmm mmhhhmmmm\" and ribs were like \"Ahhhhh yaaa ahhhhh.\" Great time had by all!\n",
      "This place was extremely unorganized. Orders came out slowly and at least half of it was wrong. The air conditioning must have been broken on our visit because it was over 90 degrees in the dining area. The food was pretty good and the only thing keeping this review from getting a one star. We ordered the rib tip sandwich but they came back 15 minutes later and said they were out so we ended up getting the pulled pork. While the food was good ( I would I say 8 out of 10) it wasn't nearly good enough to overcome the disappointment. We won't be back.\n",
      "Got the chicken and ribs dinner with green beans and fries. All delicious. Pretty much as close to being in the south as you can get in Cleveland. Served in foam carry out trays, fancy. The only thing lacking was the service but really I expected that.\n",
      "I decided to stop by here to try the Polish girl sandwich featured on Man vs. Food. The sandwich was tasty but the service is terrible. Like others have said in there reviews, the service is extremely slow. The waitresses walk slow, talk slow, and were inattentive. It also took almost 30 minutes to get one polish girl and fish sandwich (because they ran out of the popcorn shrimp my friend wanted...) which is pretty slow to me. Our waitress even disappeared during the middle of our service and it took us a extra 20 minutes to get our bill after we were done. The restaurant is also an eyesore, the pink and light blue color scheme is even more offensive to the eyes in person. I won't ever come here again but if you plan to come here, order to go!\n",
      "I shamlessly admit to straining that tin foil that comes with my rib order like a rag to get more of that tasty bbq sauce.\n",
      "This place is oh so tasty!! The great thing about their chicken is that, you don't even need their hot sauce for it to taste so good. With the hot sauce, the chicken goes from good to great. The pieces of chicken are typically big, hot, and filling. Truly hit the spot if you're wanting a taste of the south, up here in Northeast Ohio. The only problems I had with this place was that they close the dining room in the afternoon on Sunday (luckily they have the drive thru open) and the sides aren't seasoned well enough. Overall, this place is must try place.\n",
      "Manager, please delete this review after owner of Yelp has read . . . Thank you. Well, let me tell you. I love he food here! However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!! Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss. Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way. Website non-existent. My would-be communique: You lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me. I would have spent around $20. The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?! The 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on. There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there. The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes. They got tired of waiting - for anything. They left. I was now the only customer. One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action! The 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register! They did everything to pretend I wasn't there. Could they not have said \"we'll be right with you\"? Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about. There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch. I'd have spent $20 - LOSS. Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS. I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor. Frankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you. You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out. RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know. Susan Bednar\n",
      "Went late evening...door was locked this time. (Wasn't locked the last evening I went.) Parking lot full of cars that's not at restaurant. So I go to the drive thru, there's a piece of card board on the speaker that says nothing (very unprofessional.) Sat there a few minutes not knowing what to do. Went to the drive thru and placed order there. Prices were a lot more than the prices listed on line which is what I was prepared to pay. Between the drive thru speaker and not keeping up on current prices on their website, seems like they just don't care. So for now on I don't care to patron. I'll take my business elsewhere to someplace that shows the customer they care and stay professional. I'm not going to keep patronizing places that doesn't have any sort of professionalism about them. There are tons of restaurants of there!\n",
      "I found the ribs here underwhelming, they tasted a little overcooked and tough. However, fried chicken is really good here. Not overly breaded, perfectly fried, and the chicken itself is warm and tender. Get the sauce on the side, since I'd imagine you are getting takeout and the last thing you want is the chicken to turn into a sloppy mess by the time you get home. Wait times have been surprisingly long (on the order of 20 - 30 minutes) despite how there is almost no line. If you come here hungry and stare at the food while waiting, this will be torture. At least they give you so much food that it still amazes me to this day how they actually manage to fit it in the takeout box. Eating here regularly is ill-advised, if nothing else because I would prefer to not require the services of the world famous (and strategically close) Cleveland Clinic cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.\n",
      "By far the greatest place to visit. Been a fan for twenty years and until you come here you aint had real BBQ\n",
      "My fiancé and her friend got food poisoning last night. They ordered the beef ribs... Not fun and not good. I got the fried chicken which was great and i feel ok. Service is kind of shitty like other reviews have said, some people are just not positive. I guess i wouldn't be working at a BBQ place till 1:30 in the morning. I will NOT be going back. Food poisoning is a really bad thing, which means they aren't doing proper food handling.\n",
      "Delicious Fried Chicken! Though the name is Hot Sauce Williams Barbecue Restaurant, this is the place to get fried chicken not ribs. Their ribs are so so to me. The fried chicken, however, is heavenly. Their sauce is wonderful too but I always get it in a cup and put on the chicken sparingly cause the chicken is top notch without it. The crust is perfect. After eating chicken here Popeyes, Churches and the rest of those national franchises' chicken taste awful to me. Love their excellent down home side dishes too. Four stars and not five because of the ho hum customer service (sometimes) and poorly put together menu. A side note, no matter what time I come into this place the clientele is always around 60 percent Black and 40 Percent White, with more Whites eating in the restaurant and a higher percentage of Blacks taking out.\n",
      "It seems they care about their food. Tried a polish boy (it's food, I swear). It had great taste but messier than a Hollywood divorce..with kids. Couldn't be happier with the hot sauce, chicken and ribs. Ton of food for a little money. No public restrooms, fake flowers on pink tablecloths in an old fast food joint. They still yell their orders to the back. So why are they on the travel channel? They actually care about their food.\n",
      "WHAT HAPPENED?? A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here. NOT AFTER TODAY!! I used to LOVE going here! The Polish boy was one my personal favorites. Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in. I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW! 15 minutes?? I should have just parked my car and went in. Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment. I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying \"STOP! Order here!\" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra. I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one). Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru. You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing. This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit. In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages. While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!! I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98? Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG! The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything. She just \"handed\" me a receipt. Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99! I told the lady this and she just said, \"It is? I will have to change that.\" She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING?? I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them! Finally I received my food. They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male. I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, \"I can't help you, I don't work with the menu.\" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, \"I can't help you with that.\" I heard enough. \"If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!\" He replied again, \"I can't help you\" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window. I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family. What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy. Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN.\n",
      "Sweet merciful Fried Chicken and Polish Boys! It is absolutely delicious food.\n",
      "Good fried chicken and sides. I had tried some of their ribs at the Taste of Cleveland last year though, and wasn't too impressed since the meat was a little tough and the sauce, just OK.\n",
      "Mrs. Doubtfire was here! No really Robin Williams dined at this location. The Fried chicken is crunch in your mouth drippy kind of good! My favorite meal is the polish girl. it just screams \"Eat Me!!\" polish dog piled high with pulled pork, crinkled fries drenched in slaw and oh so good tangy HSW sauce. Oh how the sauce enhances the taste, Makes you want seconds Now when you eat your hot Polish Girl, you have to be gentle it tends to get sloppy. I ease on into it. I always end up with a mess on my hands and face. wipe down needed after this Feast. Sometimes I settle for the polish boy, a little less mess and take it all in kind of treat \"Ease on into it\"\n",
      "I stopped in here today to get a chicken wing dinner for my wife. After it took this young lady 10 minutes to take my my order. She tells me its going to be a few minutes on the wings to cook. So I had time to look around at all the celebrities to visit this staple in Cleveland. I also had time to see how ran down and dirty this place was. Dirty tables, floors, and walls. Ceiling falling apart. It's obvious they don't put money back into this dilapidated falling building. 30 minutes past I finally get my order. The older lady gives me my order. I asked don't I get a drink with my platter. She told me it doesn't come with a drink. I know the last time I was here I got the same thing and I got a drink with my food. Matter fact this time I got coleslaw. Last time I didn't. Bottom line I'm all for supporting my community, but if you can't do better I'm taking my money elsewhere. But I'll give you another star because my food was good.\n",
      "Lovely, beautiful, and crowded. I didn't actually shop, just walked through and looked around, but there is beautiful art all around. Don't miss out. If you need a break, come in here and just browse around. It's crowded, but for some reason, seems relaxing and calming.\n",
      "All the shoppes at the Palazzo are expensive. This is like the Rodeo Dr of California or Oak Street in the Gold Coast of Chicago. It is not like at Ceasar's Forum shops where there is a lot more variety. I like to window shop here and wish for things I can not afford, but the sales people are very pleasant here. They offered water bottles while I shopped at Tory Burch's for a specific purse my daughter was raving about. **Also important to mention is I was almost swindled into buying some \"sea-salt\" cosmetics from La Savon. It's nothing more than the other cosmetics sold in kiosks throughout Las Vegas and elsewhere...I was curious how they managed to have an actual store front shop. The woman there tried to sell me 2 bottles of makeup first for $599, then went to $199 in a matter of minutes to get a sale. I flew out of there as quick as I could. Thankfully my husband made some excuse to leave.\n",
      "A truly wonderful place to shop, whether you buy anything or not! But seriously, how, how, how could you NOT! With stores like Fendi, Dior Cosmetics (insert semi-orgasmic groan here), Tory Burch, Cole Haan and Michael Kors, it's heaven for a devoted shopa-alcho-holic like yours truly. A beautiful, fragrant atmosphere, it's just plain decadent to drift from beautiful shop to more beautiful shop, a nice solid martini in hand. Big plus that just may elevate The Shoppes At Palazzo over The Forum Shops At Caesars (at least for me) was the lack of small fry running amok. Maybe because there's no FAO or scary animatronic creatures, whatever the reason, it's great grownup fun! So, GO! Window shop, browse, buy, have a cocktail, enjoy!\n",
      "Lovely mall BUT....Ditto the reviewer from Texas, BEWARE the multiple scam store fronts (in several of the Las Vegas malls) selling \"skincare\" at crazy high prices. Moderna Tea Shop appears to be a Teavana type store .....however..... I was offered a tea sample at the door (and a tiny bag with a Costco looking teabag in it) but the situation immediately segued into a highly pressured sales pitch for $700 (!) skin care. Do not let them drag you inside to close the deal. Skip the fast taking BS, politely decline, run if you have to. Stick with Sephora, where you can verify and review what it is that you're buying.\n",
      "Another one of my favorite places to shop in Vegas. I love the huge Victoria's Secret!!! Could spend entire day shopping here!\n",
      "Large selection of high priced shops. Looked like more people were just walking around rather than buying anything.\n",
      "This gorgeous mall of shoppes in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas are pricey for sure but it's lovely to look at all the upscale items. There are a few shops here and there that won't break your bank - look for Basin (a great little soap shop that has only one other location and that's in Orlando) and Fresh (great cosmetics) and other beauty stores. Lovely restaurants and super clean throughout.\n",
      "It is connected to the Grand Canal shops at the Venetian. These shops are all high end and upscale. The only shop I could afford I think was Victoria's Secret. There is an antique bookstore that's interesting to look inside of. There were a lot if vacant spots so I'm not sure how well this place does. Nice to just stroll through. They need to consider putting in some affordable stores too, like the Grand Canal Shoppes. I was fortunate to have eaten at Mainland when the shops opened. I miss that place. It had yummy noodle dishes. A bowl of noodles was a bowl of luck! ^_^*~\n",
      "On a couple of occasions, we strolled through the Shoppes at the Palazzo. The assortment of high end brands was satisfactory, but it was not all-inclusive. For Chanel, LV, or other high end stores, you have to go across the street to the Mall. The Shoppes at the Palazzo is well-decorated with marble floors and other fine textures. If you do not like to gamble and have the means to shop at high end stores, this place is for you. As a result, we usually stick to the slot machines!\n",
      "You have to be rich AND have lots of disposable income to shop here. They really don't mess around though, there's some great high-end shopping available if you want it. We went (my girlfriend dragged me) to Christian Louboutin and Barneys New York, which is supposedly 85,000 sqft of full priced shopping goodness. Otherwise, it's your typical upscale Vegas \"mall.\" Reminds me of a super-blinged out Valley Fair. The parking lot for Palazzo is neat, it has electronic signs everywhere displaying how many spaces are available on each level. It still won't really help you find a space, but you get an idea of where to look at least. One peeve - there's an Illy gelato shop at the base of the escalators, right across from the waterfall. A scoop of gelato and a cappucino costs $11 before tax - and if you decide to eat in, they charge you an additional $0.75 to sit down. Seriously? OK, it was a decent cappucino, but damn. They could at least tell you they charge 75 cents to have you sit inside rather than outside. It's not like they have hot waitresses serving you, oh wait, you have to go to the counter and serve yourself. What a deal!\n",
      "Lovely lovely lovely. I spent some time at the Tory Burch store. Bought some darling flats and nearly broke out into a huge sweat. Man its hot in there. No air circulation at all. Next was the Michael Kors store AGAIN. This store is much smaller than the one at The Forum. Huge Burberry store with clothes, bags, shoes, scarves, EVERYTHING. great selection. The Chloé store was amazing as well. But let me tell you what did it for me was the Christian Louboutin store. Beautiful selection. This mall is next to the Canal where all the gondolas are. Lovely area. The only thing was the floor plans of the stores were a little weird to follow.\n",
      "Holy Cow, what fun here! Shopping is exquisite. I think I need 3 more jobs to pay for it, but hey, you're in vegas! Beautifully presented merchandise and spacious stores are filled with really high end designers and it's fun to just window shop if you want. I went into the Coach store and they offer many bags not found anywhere else so it was a nice store. It's nice to grab an ice cream cone and walk around to people watch and window shop, then return to reality! Fashion mall was great alternative with things I can actually afford :)\n",
      "I couldn't find a Yelp listing for Elton's so I'm reviewing it here. The store is tucked away on the upper level and I missed it the first time through the mall. I could have bought everything in the store. All of my favorite brands in one place including Mark Nason and Robert Graham. I found a shirt that I had to have, but I was leaving early the next morning and it needed some alterations. I purchased the shirt just before dinner at Postrio and between dinner and dessert courses I excused myself to pick up my perfectly altered shirt and made it back in time for dessert. Excellent service and fair prices. Elton's will be a destination on my next trip back to Vegas.\n",
      "WTF was that living gardens show about? It was the most boring shit ever. It was at the waterfall and apparently has multiple showtimes. 3 ladies dressed up as trees or some shit moving hella slow to classical music pretending to blossom. I can't believe a crowd of 100+ people actually showed up to watch it. Just glance by it if you ever come across it, window shop for a bit, then head to the casino. PS. Happy 100th review to me!\n",
      "The Shoppes at at The Palazzo needs to monitor at least one of its merchants and that would be Moderna Tea! Offered a tea sample and then plied with face cream. The high pressure con man got my husband alone and convinced him to buy $1000. worth of face goop. After we left the store we read the receipt that said no refunds. What tea shop sells high end cream? These guys are con artists and need to be stopped!\n",
      "A calmer shopping scene than Forum Shops at Caesar or Fashion Show Mall and a good blend of couture boutiques to ready-to-wear, more accessible than Crystals and Wynn-Encore Esplanade. The Venetian setting remains classic and a unique experience. Favorites include Chloe, DVF, Poleci, Barneys. Stop by Espressamente Illy for a delicious espresso or cappuccino.\n",
      "We wandered around here early one morning right after most of the shops opened. The place was empty. We seriously saw very few people as we walked around (I think they were all sleeping off their hangovers). The fountains and umbrellas are pretty and make for pretty photos. The shops are a mix of average to very expensive shops. We walked in a few and the people were friendly enough. There are some cafes and restaurants toward the far end (we were coming from the Venetian). It's a nice place to take a stroll, but it's not shopping for the average person. Besides the central gardens/fountains, the place was pretty boring.\n",
      "Though the Palazzo shares much in common with the Venetian, the Shoppes are not among them. The Palazzo is far superior in their quality of stores...including Thomas Pink, 7 for all Mankind, and Fresh (some of my favorites). The Palazzo is well worth a visit for both the gambling and shopping. A great combination if you actually manage to take some money from the casinos (only to give it back at the shops).\n",
      "Another shopping center in Vegas where you can't afford anything, or can't justify at all spending that much money on stuff you don't need. The decor is nice, though.\n",
      "Nice shops, and clean floors. Window Shopping is always fun. The employees are courteous. I would save the 10 Dollars though and not see the Dealership. Few cars are down there and you can peek in from the stairs and see everything. It was wasted 10 dollars in my book.\n",
      "I don't care if I can't afford the ultra steep priced, high end stores. This is a beautiful venue, richly decorated with a smattering of lovely fountains. It was so pleasing to the eye, and honestly, I love browsing through the shops that will never be in my price range. Okay, so I should think positively and HOPE for a day where I could afford it, but short of that happening, I can still browse and let out an occasional oooooh and aaaaah. The decor is divine !!!!!!!!!! I wanted to spend more time here, but we just didn't have it to spend.......money or time, come to think of it. Another plus, easy access to this place from the Grand Canale Shoppes. Just occurred to me, I never got to see the actual Palazzo Hotel........just saw the shops. Oh well, all the more reason for a return visit, right ??\n",
      "If you're possibly of a darker complexion, casually dressed, and with a group of 10 (including young children), this \"security guard\" will follow you AND ask you what shop you're looking for when looking at the map. Mind you, there were other individuals looking at the map, but this \"security guard\" asked me specifically what store I'm looking for. I told her, I'm looking for a bathroom and proceeds to tell me where the nearest one is then she turns back around t WE WENT AS A FAMILY WITH KIDS.\n",
      "Beautiful Shops and Fabulous restaurants. The have valet and a parking garage. Easy access and beautiful place to shop.\n",
      "Once again I prove to be a sucker for pretty, expensive stores even if I don't buy a thing! If I am lucky and happen to arrive in the middle of a sale, then I may end up the proud new owner of a Diane Von Furstenberg number. I adore her dresses, so having her shop here is enough to earn the Shoppes a solid four stars. The atmosphere is quiet and not over the top like some of the other high-end shopping experiences in Vegas. I have never seen it crowded, as it is a bit secluded and not part of a thoroughfare between casinos. If you are from out of town, it is a wonderful destination to simply escape the bustle of Vegas for a couple of hours. For me, it is a must-stop when I am on my window-shopping rounds, doing a shopping tour with visiting friends, or on the hunt for something I just have to have.\n",
      "Got to love this little shop! They have all your needs and wants! You can come here to get a few t-shirts or do a little shopping for the room. Everything from water to juices, to your adult cocktails to medicine! They have it all here. They are open 24 hours and located right beside the hotel elevators!\n",
      "I was actually quite disappointed with the Shoppes. Compared to other casino shopping centers like the Forum Shops & the shopping attached to the Venetian next door, the Shoppes really doesn't offer many choices.\n",
      "OK, I have to admit: as a guy, it takes a fair amount for a shopping area to impress me, much less warrant a full 5 of 5 stars. So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful / fun / enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas. Step 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them \"Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping\" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING! Step 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping. Step 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable. Step 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill. Step 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date / significant other. Step 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it. Step 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT. Step 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything. There you have it guys...I just showed you how to have THE BEST trip to Vegas with your lady / significant other. PS: You can use this unlimited times and your gal will ALWAYS want to go back to Vegas then.\n",
      "Beautiful place. Nice and simple with great art and service. They r connected with the Venetian so its really cool to walk over. Great for families. And they have a great view\n",
      "Love shopping in Vegas! The Palazzo shops are great for everyone. Just awesome to walk around and check out the decor. Amazing place.\n",
      "I have to agree with others. The Shoppes lacks personality. Comparing this place to the Shoppes at the Venetian is like comparing night and day. They do have a bunch of high end shops but these stores are often available at places such as the Forum Shops, Bellagio, and Wynn. Further, the stores here are pretty small (except for Barneys) and their other locations often have more stuff. It's nice to walk around but if you're looking to make a purchase, head to one of the other casinos and do it there.\n",
      "i found the shoppes in the palazzo to be relaxing and great place to walk around and window shop. the only store i could actually afford to buy anything was the victoria secret store. i picked up some beautiful bras and bubble bath.\n",
      "This is a beautiful upscale mall to shop in. Even if your budget doesn't allow it, it's a great way to spend an afternoon window shopping. A must see.\n",
      "I love this place - Tory Burch, Christan Louboutin, DVF, Catherine Malandrino, Jimmy Choo, 7 for All Mankind, Chloe, and Michael Kors, just to name a few. Great place to window shop, though sometimes there are sales (watch out now!). Great place to visit while the mister gambles. I always hit up these shops, Venetian, Wynn, and the Fashion Show Mall.\n",
      "I kept getting lost!!! This place is so freaking confusing. Only place I actually purchased anything was the Fresh store. High, high end window shopping is just not my thing.\n",
      "Can't say I've ever liked a dentist until now. To start, the place is BEAUTIFUL. A very different look than you'd expect from your typical dental office. I came in for my annual cleaning and this office is down the street from my house. The exam room is awesome, they had a TV on the ceiling, X-rays much easier that what I was use to and many other gadgets that not only made my exam more pleasant but more accurate for the Dr. The staff are the sweetest people and super friendly from the receptionist to the tech assistant and the Dr himself. Now 5 days later my teeth feel cleaner than ever. Side note I've dreaded all my other cleanings due to the pain following it, not this time.\n",
      "My dental work has come from Dr. Greep for a few years now. I would absolutely recommend this dental establishment. Nice, clean, diligent, friendly, and smaller with one on one service.\n",
      "This is the best dental office I have ever been to. Dr. Greep is very professional. I had a lot of dental work done and he explained every step to me so I could understand. I didn't feel any pain. I highly recommend him.\n",
      "Wie schon erwähnt, rustikales und eher altbackenes Ambiente, aber gemütlich. Bedienung ist sehr freundlich. Wir hatten Pizza, die recht passabel war. Insgesamt kein Laden zum Schick essen gehen, Aber für eine Pizza zwischendurch eine Empfehlung.\n",
      "Bodenständige italienische Küche, eher rustikales unedles Ambiente, sehr freundliche, aber manchmal schnarchige Kellner, wenn der Chef noch nicht da ist. Finde es liebenswert und gemütlich, gehe immer wieder gerne hin.\n",
      "Eine kleine und gemütliche Pizzeria mit leckeren Pizzen und Nudelgerichten. Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis und freundlicher Service.\n",
      "Tolle italienische Küche in einer unscheinbaren Location in Stuttgart West. Sowohl Service als auch die Speisen sind super und das Preis-Leistungs Verhältnis ist mehr als gut! Gutschein wurde gerne angenommen und als Dankeschön gab es ein Grapa aufs Haus. Sehr zu Empfehlen!\n",
      "Ein Vorurteil verwandelte sich bei dieser Pizzeria in eine absolute Überraschung. Wir sind schon öfter an dieser Pizzeria vorbeigegangen und ich habe über den Namen etwas die Nase gerümpft - Regenbogen, das klingt so nach schlechter 80er Jahre Taverne. Drinnen ist es dann im ersten Eindruck auch ein bisschen, wie bei einer kleinen Zeitreise - allerdings nicht in die 80er, sondern in die 90er, in die mich gerade die Lampen und die Einrichtung zurückversetzten. Was ich aber sehr charmant fand, waren die Theaterfotografien an den Wänden. Beim Service war ich am Anfang etwas verunsichert, weil der gute Herr wirklich finster gucken konnte, aber das verbesserte sich im Laufe des Abends merklich und jeder, der an unseren Tisch kam war immer höflich und professionell. Außerdem waren Getränke und Speisen immer unverzüglich an unserem Tisch, auch als es später am Abend sehr voll wurde - so lob ich mir das. Das Essen war dann ein wahres Gedicht, angefangen beim Brotkorb mit frisch gebackenen Pizzabrötchen bis hin zur Nachspeise, was wieder zeigt, dass man sich nicht von Äußerlichkeiten abschrecken lassen darf. Auf der gemischten Vorspeisenplatte fanden wir ein Gedicht an italienischer Salami und Schinken sowie exzellentem Käse. Mein Bruschetta war ein frisch gebackener halber Pizzafladen mit frischen Tomatenstückchen, die ordentlich mit Knoblauch garniert waren - sehr lecker! Die Hauptgerichte haben uns dann absolut überzeugt: Ich hatte frische Nudeln von der Tageskarte mit Steinpilzen. Die Nudeln waren einen winzigen Tacken zu al dente für meinen Geschmack, aber sie zogen noch etwas nach. Die Steinpilze in der Soße mit frischen Kräutern waren hervorragend. Aber das absolute Highlight war die Pizza: wie in Italien. Hauchdünner, geschmacklich hervorragender, knuspriger, aber nicht trockener Teig mit leckerem Mozzarella, der ordentlich Fäden zieht und frischem Belag, der die anderen Zutaten nicht erstickt. Ich bin sonst von Pizza nicht so leicht zu beeindrucken, aber diese war einfach ein Gedicht. Der Tiramisu zum Nachtisch musste dann noch sein, obwohl wir eigentlich schon satt waren. Er hat den hervorragenden Eindruck des Essens noch unterstrichen. Auch der Wein war hervorragend und mit 4,50 Euro für 1/4 Liter auch nicht besonders teuer. Insgesamt war das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis (9 Euro für die Pizza, 10,50 Euro für die Nudeln) für die Qualität absolut angebracht. Einer meiner Lieblingsitaliener in Stuttgart, wenn es mal eher gemütlich als schick sein soll.\n",
      "Erst war ich Nicht so überzeugt von der Pizzeria. Von außen eher unscheinbar. Als ich dann meine Pizza bekam war ich sehr überrascht. Die Pizza geschmacklich super. Die Bedienung immer freundlich und hilfsbereit. Ich gehe auf jedenfalls wieder hin.\n",
      "Unser erster und letzter Besuch: Leider müssen wir von einem Besuch der Trattoria Regenbogen im St. Westen abraten. Unsere Erfahrungen von Heute: 1. Aus dem Nebenzimmer zog Rauch zu uns rüber 2. Wir kippten entsprechend das Fenster kurze Zeit später stürmte der Kellner an uns vorbei und schloss es wieder 3. In der Vorspeise Vitello Tonnato fand sich ein Stück Plastik (3cm!). Ich gab das Plastikstück zurück, erhielt aber weder eine Entschuldigung noch einen neuen Teller lediglich ein Oh. Darüber hinaus war das Fleisch nicht durch und schmeckte nicht gut. 4. Der Hugo war sehr wässrig und der Holunderblütensirup war ganz unten 5. Nach dem Bezahlen empfahl ich dem Kellner, doch künftig bei solchen Dingen wie Plastik im Essen zumindest einen Grappa oder Cappuccino anzubieten. Die Antwort: Nein, das machen wir nicht ist menschlich, kann doch passieren.\n",
      "Well this place WAS a good location to get a nice spray tan, and they regularly offered plenty of packages and discounts, but unfortunately they closed their doors unexpectedly last week. I have been in contact with their corporate headquarters but have received no resolution, as they have been unable to secure the client list/information from the defunct location. Needless to say, their lack of professionalism in closing their location so suddenly and the fact that I have money tied up in something I can no longer use is a bit irritating.\n",
      "I agree with the other reviews. Staff was so unpleasant I only continued to go until my package expired. Will not return.\n",
      "Just purchased a Groupon for this location and my experience was great! (And yes they do accept proof of Groupon if the voucher is on your phone). The girl at the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable! She even offered a free upgrade for the stronger bed due to the fact that the bed my Groupon was good for had been occupied and would have required a wait time. Above and beyond customer service!\n",
      "Try to cancel a membership here and you quickly find they have a multi-level song-and-dance about why they keep charging your card. It is rehearsed nonsense about why 3 different layers of management need to get back to you before they can fix an obvious mistake, but none of those people are ever around, or can return your call, or have other contact info, or ... you get the idea. Do not trust them with your credit card info, and if you have made that mistake, just call your card and have them cancel any bogus charges. They are familiar with these jokers and will save you the frustration of their runaround.\n",
      "I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011. I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience. On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone. I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them. I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand. The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer. She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge. This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%. I was disappointed, to say the least. I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses. They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs. Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth. I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.\n",
      "This place is terrible as far as hours go. On multiple occasions I came here during their normal hours, which are posted on the door and online, and they were closed. There was one occasion where the girl to open the door and didn't even address me. It was a half hour before closing time and 15 minutes before the last UV session was supposed to take place. I eventually knocked on the door and she let me tan, but I was still annoyed because on another occasion, I went at 9:30 am, their normal business hours begin at 9:00, and there was no one in sight!\n",
      "I can typically take or leave hotel restaurants as well, they are hotel restaurants. Burnham is way different. On our last AM in town we were hitting breakfast before hitting 71 to go home. Anthony was our server. Two omelets with wheat toast, fruit for me potatoes for my BFF. Coffee. Juice. Ice Tea. What SOLD US and has us on Yelp and then Trip Advisor was my ask for ice water after I downed my coffee. Anthony turned around grabbed a glass, held it up and checked to make sure it was clean. We went crazy - that NEVER happens but at the Burnham. When we praised him he said, \"I'm not gonna give out no dirty glass.\" LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When he stopped by to pick up our plates he so proudly said, \"I love picking up dirty clean plates!\" BAWHAHAHAHAHA! Just absolutely too cute. Lots of professionalism. Lots of personality. Quite the impression. The food was perfect. The omelets were not in excess. Enough eggs and stuffing of our choice to balance it all out. What an experience. We hit so many breakfast places in town I'm sorry we didn't do this more than once. Thank you Anthony!\n",
      "The waiter was poorly trained and seemed unhappy with his job. Complained that Lebron was a bad tipper. Interrupted our business conversations. Didnt give me a menu until i asked. We had bought 2 bottles of wine and he did not come back to refill. Frankly I was a bit embarrassed hosting a business meeting there. Food was unremarkable as well.\n",
      "I came to Cleveland to watch the cavaliers, raptors game the restaurant at the hotel was the burnham restaurant, we were all trying to figure out where to eat and we pulled the menu up on our phones and we decided this place. The service was some of the best I've had, My server Jeff was a very genuine guy, I've been to many restaurants where servers are nice, but it seems like it's a forced attitude, but I could tell Jeff even outside of work acted the exact same and was a joy to be around, The food was amazing too we tried a bit of everything and had no complaints about anything. Some of the food we had was the \"soul bowl\" which was pork belly on top of mac and cheese, the chicken wings confit, hangar steak, Buffalo chicken pizza, and a burger. I would get it all again, but the steak and the pork belly was my absolute 2 favourites, you have to try it out for yourself to see why I'm talking about!\n",
      "Came for my birthday dinner. The hotel is new and very beautifully designed, and we had read good reviews of the Burnham. Did not disappoint! I recommend the small plates--so much choice! I had the peiroghi, the fried chicken confit, and the table shared the cheese creme with mushroom. H had the oyster spaghetti. Excellent service--not pushy, not absent. Crowd is good--dates/couples, friends/family meet up. I don't think this is a kid place--definitely an adult vibe. I'd like to stay down here and make it a whole night away in my own city.\n",
      "Food is ok but expensive. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. The hotel tries to do a good job and wants to provide a great experience, unfortunately, the restaurant staff have poor attitudes don't really understand what good service means.\n",
      "Fantastic restaurant in the Hilton Cleveland! We ordered salads and they were as good as the entrées. Huge offset bowls with enough fresh, unique ingredients (fresh, whole anchovies, pickled eggs, fresh shaved cheese) to make you think twice about ordering additional items from the menu...nah, there's more to explore! You have to try the French toast...yes, anytime of day! It's not what you think. Shredded chicken, a sauce and season combo that takes your taste buds on a roller coaster, and soft & slight crunch in the toast peeking from beneath. One of my all-time favorites!!\n",
      "Overall impressions: swanky lounge in a swanky hotel serving up new takes on old favorites. Staff are still growing into their roles, but friendly. Good for dressy dates, business meetings, and hopefully drinks on the patio when the weather is warmer! It's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week. The Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start. Our hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go. Like others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over. But food-wise, we felt we got what we paid $30 (+ an appetizer) for. The menu, the staff, the booty-sucking seats, it all feels a little experimental, but I think we got some positive results out of the evening.\n",
      "What a refreshing experience! Beginning with a friendly greeting and seating, followed by a delicious breakfast buffet satisfying every imaginable taste desire, and all made better by the most polite and attentive server we have experienced in a long time. Craig was a pure delight! His contribution to our dining experience was as important as the food. Craig needs to be cloned.\n",
      "Nice upscale take on Cajun. Nice place for a rich dinner after a day of conference smarts. Our favorites were actually the appetizers: pierogies and the divine goat cheese creme brulee! Hanger steak was delicious and perfectly cooked, if a little salty.\n",
      "Ate here when I arrived in the evening on a business trip. It was a strange restaurant. There was a large buffet that appeared to just be supplies (not for customers). The waitress couldn't answer any of our questions. My colleague and I both have fairly typical food restrictions (I don't eat meat; he's Celiac/gluten-intolerant) but the waitress didn't know what would be suitable for either of us. The menu did not indicate some key ingredients, either (like that they use bacon fat on the green bean sides). She asked the chef and he suggested a salad for my colleague and a pizza for me. The pizza a 6-inch flatbread. It was ok, but felt like an appetizer. Overall, it was fine for the lazy evening after a long day of travel, but I wouldn't go again if there were other choices.\n",
      "We stayed at the hotel and decided to check out this restaurant. All of us were very impressed with the food and staff. The hanger steak I had was amazing. Their version of the carrot cake was nothing like I have ever had but it was great. If I ever go back to cleveland I will make sure I return.\n",
      "The Cleveland Plain Dealer gave this restaurant an excellent rating, so I made reservations. After that I read other reviews, some of which were negative, so I dined a there tonight fearful that I had made a mistake. I was delighted by the delicious food and excellent service! I highly recommend it and hope that others will try it, as it was pretty empty on a Saturday night, although this could have been caused by upcoming Fathers' Day. Visit the bar on the 32nd floor for a wonderful view of the city. I will return and recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "Attention to detail on favorite comfort foods such as the Shrimp and Grits and Fried Chicken with charred cabbage results in lively fresh takes on tradition. However the staff was not up to par, the hostesses could not pull up our reservation, waitress got our dessert order wrong, forgot what my entree was immediately after I ordered and there was that discussion on what Prosecco is. That being said, this is a newly opened restaurant and there is clearly a lot of field training going on. Just wish the staff was better prepared. Rating would be higher except for the service. We'll be back in a few months after the kinks are worked out as the food is so worth it.\n",
      "I could go on for hours about how wonderful this place and its staff are. I had the best pancakes I've ever eaten and a wonderful mimosa. We came in at noon (lunch time), and the staff happily accommodated our dying need for some breakfast food. This is a must for brunch.\n",
      "I stopped in here a few weeks ago when my friend and I were trying to go to the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event and we were starving. It was pretty empty while we were in here, so we got a seat right away. Our server was great - very attentive and our food was super timely. I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Pizza, which was delicious. I wish I could have taken it home with me, but I was heading out for a night on the town, so I had nowhere to stash it. This place is great for an anniversary dinner, lunch with a friend or colleague, or a place to celebrate a family occasion.\n"

      "Excellent service & food. I had the grilled salmon & my husband had the muffuletta sandwich. Yum!\n",
      "Terrible. Had reservations. Not busy. Hostess was clueless. Left us at restaurant bar and kept seating people with no reservations. Talked to hostess, did not care. Never seated us. Wont be back.\n",
      "I came here last night while on a business trip. I was not too impressed. The food was decent but the service not so much. We sat on the outdoor terrace and the waitress forgot about us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was light and delicious. We also had the shrimp and gnocchi (only came with 3 pieces of shrimp) and the wings which were good but nothing special. I ordered the fried chicken confit which was good but not as flavorful as I had expected. It's conveniently located in the hotel but next time I'll venture out into the city.\n",
      "Chose to visit the new Hilton Downtown and new restaurant for a birthday. Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there. Ours was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates. After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice. All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party. The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland. The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in. The shrimp and grits were great. Our second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza. While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good. The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british/irish delicacy and delight. The mashed potatoes and gravy were great. The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was. The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful. Our party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75). The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious. The staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant. The new hotel is beautiful inside. Wish the Bar 32 (bar and patio on the 32nd floor) was open but its still not finished. Our server Joseph made the night especially nice with his knowledge and hospitality. Would like to try breakfast/brunch next time maybe but we will definitely by back.\n",
      "If you want to eat at a restaurant that strives to exactly satisfy the average palate of the average American diner, this is the place for you. The menu and the wine list will have exactly all the regular, normal choices that the average eater will not be offended by. If you want a memorable meal, go elsewhere.\n",
      "I'm not sure why urban farmer has better review than this place. The food was really good for a restaurant that is maintained by the hotel. I've tried 4 different meal and dessert and nothing is bad.. I'm thinking that the review is low due to price but I can assure you that the quality and freshness of the ingredients is fantastic.. u get what u paid for. The service is not bad... just a relax environment in which u can enjoy your dinner.. I'm giving this a 4.5 star due to price but if u are looking for a quality and taste, this is definitely a must try in Cleveland.. I recommend any seafood entree.. salmon, trout and walleye..\n",
      "I came here for a late solo dinner, got in on a business flight around 10 PM. I had two small plates, the shitake perogies and the goat cheese creme brulee because they sounded the most intriguing to me. B The goat cheese was rich if not particularly flavorful, went very nicely with the crostini that came along with it. The perogies were a definite hit however, savory with tart sauerkraut and a nice mashed potato side. The bartender was very friendly and helpful. A nice selection of beers on draft. Overall a very acceptable hotel restaurant, can't comment on the entree options but overall this is a place worth a visit if you want something simple and are staying at the Hilton.\n",
      "Slow service and okay food. Only ate here because too cold to walk anywhere. Waiter spent most of the time chatting with another table while I needed service. Will not eat here again.\n",
      "Came here for lunch with two others and did not have a great experience. It was pretty busy upon arrival, however we made a reservation so we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. It was a nice day so we were asked if we'd like outdoor seating, which we agreed to. Service was extremely poor. We had a reservation for 12:15, we were sat at 12:20 and we did not get our food until 1:20. It took 20 minutes for our server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and another 5-10 minutes for my soda to arrive. We weren't told what the soup of the day was, we weren't told about any specials and we weren't even asked if we'd dined with them before (this place just opened after all). All in all, our server took 30 minutes just to take our order. 25-30 minutes later our food arrived. My friends got the field green salads (which they actually enjoyed, hence the two stars). I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich, which I did not enjoy at all. The breading on the chicken was bland and tasteless and to be honest, when I cut my chicken open with my knife (this is an open-faced sandwich by the way, something the menu doesn't say) it looked pretty gross in the middle. My fries were simple shoestring fries that tasted fine. The poor service in combination with the bland tasting food will be the reason I likely will not return. With all the great restaurants available in Cleveland, this one is not worth going to (at least for lunch).\n",
      "This was not the best experience. The food was decent and the service was terrible. Waited entirely too long for basic things like drinks and to place our order.. mind you, the place was no where near full. Our waitress could have cared less about anything, and it showed. Won't be going back ever. Not worth it.\n",
      "Really enjoyed our night sitting at the bar at The Burnham. Rob the bartender/mixologist (not to sound too hipster but this guy is a professional) was very knowledgeable, funny and a great steward for Cleveland. He gave us tips on where to spend our weekend and he did not disappoint! On to the food: Husbandface was obsessed with the pierogies, I was obsessed with the French toast small plate. I'm going to try to recreate it at home and will probably fail a million times it was so good. Drinks: Thumbs up. Let Rob know what your tastes are and trust him to make you your personality in a glass. Because that pretty much happened. It was our first time in Cleveland and we had to force ourselves to NOT go back to the Burnham for every meal just so we could branch out!\n",
      "Had the fried chicken confit. I swear on earth I've never had anything better. It was the perfect size and the cheese dumplings on the side were perfect.\n",
      "Food is pretty good for a Hotel. Much better places in downtown, especially for dinner. Service was terrible. Hilton needs to up service in the restaurant. My wife and I were meeting people in the terrific bar on the 32nd floor. I showed up late an had trouble getting someone so i could order a drink. Decide to have dinner in the Burnham. It was 8:30 on a week night. Almost no one in the place. Our server may have also been the bartender. She paid almost no attention to us. Bad service can certainly ruin a good meal.\n",
      "Food was good. Had to wait a very long time for eggs and sausage. Team seemed to be short-staffed in the kitchen. The wait impacted my overall experience. I expected more efficiency from a 4-star hotel.\n",
      "I love this place! Sherri the bartender was awesome and Chef Ryan brought the food directly to me! What a friendly environment I had the buffalo pizza and Caesar salad my first night and the muffalatta sandwich the next day. Everything was fresh and tasty!!\n",
      "Hotel restaurants are always hit or miss but this one was a nice experience. The ambiance is upbeat and lively -- an open kitchen will also help with that -- and the prices were fair, if not better than expected. My Cotes du Rhone Rosé was $9.50 a glass and the dinner specials on a Saturday night included a super affordable (and pleasantly portioned) Sous Vide Chicken plate. Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave. The Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that. I wasn't however, a fan of the BBQ sauce that adorned the chicken. Thankfully, it was mostly served on the side so the dish was still a great choice. Johnny was a very pleasant server and we worked up a nice rapport by the end. His recommendations were genuine and he steered me toward a dish that I would enjoy - one thing I appreciate in a server! His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum! All in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)! Final thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time.\n",
      "We came in after watching a sunset up at Bar 32 on a Friday evening. I had read all the Burnham reviews and looked at the menu on line. It looked very promising. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away. We had a reservation which was not required. 40-60% full during the peak dining hour. Service while attentive was only hotel restaurant style, Lacking the type of service professionals found in fine dining establishments. The menu was very well composed and interesting. It offered some good choices. But the preparation and presentation was just ok. The prices were not outrageous. No way it gets 5 stars. So not a destination place in my book. If I have to meet someone staying in the hotel, I am happy to have a meal there. But no more Burnham date nights for me.\n",
      "I'm always a little skeptical of hotel restaurants/bars, but this one impressed me. Everything was delicious and service was great. The atmosphere is pretty decent, but the patio wasn't open yet when I was there, so I suspect that it's great. The tapas are really unique, but my husband and I opted for entrees. I did see the table next to us, ordered tapas, and they looked and smelled amazing, and we're really generous portions. My husband thought his pork entree was smaller than he wanted, but my fish was perfection. I can't wait to go back for girls' night to order a bunch of small plates!\n",
      "I wanted to give this place one star before ever stepping foot into the restaurant... I called on a Monday to make a reservation for 12 people. I was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he needed manager approval for that many people, and put me on hold. I waited a few minutes, and when he returned he informed me that he couldn't find a manager but would take down my information and someone would call me back. I waited 24 hours and didn't hear from anyone, so I called back. I explained that I had called the day before and needed to speak to a manager, and was placed on hold for ELEVEN MINUTES before I finally hung up. I called back for a third time and immediately asked to speak to a manager, by which the person responded rudely \"well can I take a message, we are a little busy right now.\" I said \"no, you may not take a message, I need to speak with a manager immediately.\" I was placed on hold AGAIN, this time for more than five minutes. I FINALLY got a manager, Franc, on the phone who didn't even bother apologizing for my troubles. On Wednesday I get a call from the restaurant (two days after my first attempt to make a reservation) telling me they couldn't accommodate my party. I explained to them that the manager had confirmed just yesterday, and after being placed on hold YET AGAIN, they confirmed that indeed they could accommodate me. I mean honestly. FIGURE YOUR SHIT OUT. If it were up to me, I would not have even given this restaurant my business after that experience, but the group had already collectively agreed to eat here. Fast forward to Saturday... Our server was nice enough but his \"helpers\" were more attentive than he was, we waited forever for our drinks and dinner, one persons meal never made it out, and the food was just okay. Overall, the experience was awful and there are so many other restaurants in Cleveland with better food and service. I will not be returning to the Burnham.\n",
      "The fact that this place has 3 dollar signs is not accurate to me. I had a chicken confit small plate, which was more than filling, and it was about $11. I was really craving fried chicken and that meal hit the spot with hints of exotic undertones! Really nice, modern, and quiet ambiance for a late dinner and the staff is readily available to suggest what to eat. My co-worker and I enjoyed the experience. Only thing I would say is that the menu needs an interpreter basically. When you first look at it you read something like bread pudding but then underneath it states there are gizzards in it. Not typically what you would think, right? Fact of the matter is, after our waitress explained the take on bread pudding and french toast that they utilized, it was much easier to make a decision. My co-worker got a french toast type plate which was a savory take on a pulled pork dish and she thoroughly enjoyed it.\n",
      "I was at The Burnham for the first time this past weekend. It was my friends birthday and we had a party of 6. The service was great! Our server was super nice, kept our drinks full and brought out our food in a timely manner. I got the salmon and it was delicious! The skin was super crispy and it was a large portion. Everyone at the table was pleased with their dishes as well. The staff was very welcoming. I would highly suggest going here.\n",
      "I went here for dinner a few weeks ago. My friend and I were planning to do apps and drinks at the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event so we decided to head downstairs for dinner. A lot of things on the menu sounded really good to me, but I went with my usual go to and ordered the salmon. It was pretty good, but was just super salty so not the best I've ever had. My friend ordered the Southwest shrimp pizza, which was amazing! We were one of only 3 or 4 tables in the restaurant so service was great. The prices were about average with most restaurants downtown so nothing too shocking.\n",
      "The Burnham just opened on June 1st and we thought we'd try something new. Normally, new restaurants mess up something so our expectations were not high. Let me say this...Burnham was phenomenal and exceeded all of our expectations by leaps and bounds. I cannot wait to go back! The decor is very modern, yet warm and inviting. The service was top notch and very friendly. We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great. After the first round, we were letting him just give us whatever he wanted. He makes great mocktails too. Food..OMG. I want to go back the very next day and repeat the entire experience. We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits. Once again, everything was top notch...our plates were clean very quickly. Even the dishes we were on the fence about ordering we wound up raving about. The Burnham is a great addition to Cleveland downtown - we'll be back!!\n",
      "The brunch buffet had a beautiful display and was dutifully maintained. The eggs were a strange, jiggly texture and bland. The French toast was great, but the syrup was flavorless. Excellent tasting and perfectly portioned smoothie shots. Not all of the items were clearly labeled so my vegan friend was upset from consuming meat in the potato hash. I recommend signs for each prepared item with symbols for meat, dairy, soy, seafood, and vegan items. Thank you for handling our large group with great service and attention.\n",
      "Great variety and the best dog in town. Try the rice crispy marshmallow shake/flurry thing. Ridiculous!\n",
      "This was my first visit and I was definitely NOT impressed. The service was quick, but not necessarily competent and the food was overpriced. *On a side note, if you order root beer with your combo, be prepared to receive a 12oz drink instead of the 16oz that supposedly comes with it.\n",
      "Went to their grand opening on the June 17th and despite the fact that they were slammed I cannot say enough about the customer service and hustle the entire Retro Dog team exhibited. The wait was long due to the insane amount of guests but have every expectation that their service will be no less than amazing going forward. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat with an updated diner feel. The original artwork speaks for itself. I tried the Retro Dog as I am a HUGE fan of Coney dogs. The sauce was different and sweeter than the \"traditional\" Coney sauce but a good surprising spin on an old original. Toppings were ample and the natural casing hot dog cooked to perfection. I ordered the Coney fries to go with and I may have overdosed on the Coney aspect of things and think they might ne better paired with a different dog. Delicious all the same. The custard cone with the salted chocolate dip and caramel was ridiculous. Although full from my meal, I still couldn't help but finish. The salted chocolate adds the perfect savory to the caramel's and custard's sweet. Retro Dog is definitely worth a visit and I plan on returning multiple times to try the entire menu.\n",
      "Good food. Way over priced as everything is extra. Tried copying Teds Hotdogs in Western New York. I'll wait for a road trip back home to get my dogs at a much more reasonable price.\n",
      "This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. Come for the food, but stay for the shakes. If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron.\n",
      "If you are looking for a fun little place to go every once in a while, go here. They have all sorts of good quality hot dogs and hamburgers; including veggie style ones. The drinks and milkshakes are awesome, too. The ambiance is very cheesy, but it works. I want to write more about this place, but there really isn't a lot to say. It's a hot dog place... You'll enjoy!\n",
      "Love this place! My kids ask to go every week! I don't eat red meat, so of course when my husband suggested a hot dog place I reluctantly went! I was pleasantly surprised by the menu! A veggie dog, chicken sandwich and veggie burger! I've had the veggie dog and chicken sandwich, both were great! I'm trying the veggie burger next! Oooh, and the milkshakes, so yummy. Oh and the veggie cheese fries, so good! Even if you like meat the veggie options will satisfy...just has my husband the meat eater! Not only is the food great, the service is absolutely amazing too! So friendly!\n",
      "Fun place and something a little different. Hot dog and burger options abound. The onion rings and fries are greasy and delicious - dip them both in whatever magical sauce comes with the onion rings. Chili and root beer are also good This is not a place for people who are afraid of calories - they have a token side salad and a black bean burger if you want to feign healthy eating while scarfing fries. Ordering is kind of a pain especially if there's a line since there's not a lot of room to stand in line - you order at the counter; then the order taker takes your money and gets your drinks; you sit down; and they bring the food out to you sometimes having to call out by name. They have car service outside, why not have wait service inside?\n",
      "I don't know how they stay in business. There's never anyone there. The dogs and milkshakes are good. It can't hold a candle to Swenson's, but it's closer to where I love, so it's still a contender for me.\n",
      "Not what I was expecting. The \"retro\" style was only apparent by the colors of the restaurant. 1990s music was playing. The food was nothing to write home about. The same veggie hotdog can be bought from the local grocer. The vegetarian coney sauce was nothing fantastic. Fries are not fresh cut. Not especially delicious. On a positive note, my mud pie shake was delicious. Friendly staff. 2 dogs+2 fries+2 shakes dine in= $20.81 Overall, it was mediocre. Not worth the bill.\n",
      "Retro Root Beer in a FROSTY MUG! Super creamy, real Frozen Custard! Burgers, Dogs and Fries with an overwhelming array of topping choices. We visited on a Sunday evening, and ate inside. Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was spot-on! The Onion Rings were a highlight for me... Made fresh to order, tender inside, light and crisp fried tempura batter outside. I'm my opinion... They could NOT be better! Highly recommend that you give RETRO DOG a try!\n",
      "1st trip here .. my husband had 2 dogs w/yellow mustard .. I had 1 w/chili + yellow mustard + 1 with chili + yellow mustard .. we both enjoyed our dogs .. but the stand out was the battered onion rings .. totally delicious .. wish we had gotten a large order to split but w/2 dogs each we wanted to pace ourselves .. root beer float & black cherry soda were the chosen beverages .. we will be back .. not only for more onion rings but perhaps to try a burger next time .. a bit of a drive from our home in Cleveland but a decent road trip to treat ourselves every so often .. far exceeded our expectations & now there is no need to go to Sonic ever again .. thank God!\n",
      "This review is written by my 6 year old son. \"The ice cream is really good and icy here. The twist is my favorite. Also, the grilled cheese is pretty cheesy!\"\n",
      "I appreciate what they're trying to do here. They went all-in on the retro drive-in look and unique variations on the dog-and-burger menu. I've tried three different dogs and one burger; fries and rings. The meat and fixings are fine -- not spectacular, but OK. On my most recent visit, the poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog was distinctly stale. (I've run into a similar problem at some other places, where they don't sell many Chicago dogs so the special poppy seed buns sit around for far too long.) I'll echo what at least one other commenter said: The sodas are bizarrely small portions. They boast about their own root beer. In house, it comes in what looks like a nice-sized chilled glass mug, but turns out to be largely ice. I got a to-go version one, and it was a tiny cup, again with the ice -- and filled to the brim so that spilling was inevitable.\n",
      "i'm generously giving RETRO Dog 3 stars because it's a cool concept and a cool looking place. there was really nothing wrong with our food, it just wasn't awesome and there was a HUGE issue with the place we didn't notice until we sat down (we ate inside). it was Danielle's idea for lunch (because she thinks i have the palette of a 4 year old, i guess) and we drove out after making our final payment for our September vacation (which was on the way). Danielle ordered a Memphis Belle Chicken sandwich and i ordered a Carolina dog and a White Hot dog. we got these as combos so that we could share an order of fries and an order of onion rings and each came with a soda. Danielle said her sandwich was good but was served very hot (which i'd like to think is the idea, right?). the White Hot that i ordered (a hot dog made of veal and pork - which looks \"white\" when cooked) was good enough, but not terribly flavorful. it could have used a spicier mustard or maybe just more than what was on it (which honestly looked like enough). i didn't care for the Carolina dog (a Coney w/ coleslaw and yellow mustard). i didn't like the coney sauce or the coleslaw. in fact, i removed the wiener and ate it separately - making it considerably more tolerable. the fries and the onion rings were good, though maybe the rings were a little overcooked. i thought they tested good anyway. the sodas were really small and the entire cup was filled with ice so that you took about 3 pulls off the straw and the Coke or Diet Coke within was gone. they were kind enough to refill, though. our biggest complaint was that the place was overrun by flies. they were everywhere. i'm not some dandy that can't handle a fly here and there, but there were like 8 per table just hanging out flying around and on the food and just buzzing our faces while we tried to eat. assuming we go back (and i would like to try the Kraut Dog as well as the Big Sal sandwich and maybe others) we'll probably order from our car or we'll get it to go and dine without the flies.\n",
      "My friends and I walked to Retro dog after school. We assumed it would be cheaper than wing warehouse. The staff was helpful and friendly. My friends and I got milkshakes and burgers. I got a milkshake and cheese fry and my friend, who I payed for, got a burger and milkshake. I didn't expect the total to come as $20 but we enjoyed our time there and the food was good.\n",
      "I really was looking forward to a great hot dog and was suprised the retro dog was so tasteless and boring. I was surprised when I saw the lady sweeping the floor put the broom down and take the French frie with her bare hands and put my order of fries in the fryer.\n",
      "Went for lunch with co-workers. I had the Chicago dog and onion rings with a drink. Dog was excellent, rings not so much. Incredibly greasy - even too much for rings. Unfortunately my co-worker had a disasterous Retro Burger. There was a 9\" or so brown, curly hair found in the MIDDLE of her burger. We observed a female employee with shoulder-length, brown, curly hair; not tied back or in a hair net, cooking the food. This is gross, unsanitary, and bad restaurant management. According to www.fda.gov - retail food protection - Chapter 2-402.11: \" (A) Food employees shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed FOOD; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles. It was asked that the burger be re-made, and yet again, the same female employee was cooking as before. The practice of employee hygiene is a basic essential of running a restaurant. Shame on the owner for not being aware of day-to-day operations with his/her employee(s). I will not be going back, nor recommending this establishment.\n",
      "New drive in - classic style! Hosted my son's 8th birthday here and the staff and food is amazing. They brew their own pop, root beer and beer as well. Lots of special events and great burgers and dogs.\n",
      "Others seem to enjoy the restaurant, so maybe you will enjoy it, but... My wife's hotdog was warm rather than hot. It was also very small compared to the bun. My cheeseburger was the same way. The root beer was close, but too sweet for both out tastes. I think that they spent too much effort on the decor and TVs and not enough on the food.\n",
      "Run, don't walk, to Retro Dog. Had lunch there yesterday. Great food and very nice and attentive people. Had dogs and delicious fries, very crispy and hot! Dogs had a nice snap and the buns were perfect. They have so much more than the dogs, too. Lots of choices. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's not just drive up. There is nice seating inside for at least 40. Get out to Retro Dog and support a local business with very good food and wonderful people!\n",
      "Love this place, cool decor, great menu and friendly staff. We go out of our way just to eat here. Most likely one of the rare instances where a hot dog place also offers great burgers, shakes and even a veggie option!\n",
      "Nothing fancy at all. I was expecting something like Chicago dogs. Pretty small also considering it's a hot dog place\n",
      "This is the part of being a food adventurer that bites you in the ass. This has got to be the 2nd worse place I have ever been too. There dogs are no better than what you buy at the store, so save yourself time and money and just go to the grocery store. For 4.29 I got a foot long dog that was saturated in crap! I couldn't find the dog at first and had to get a spoon and scrape everything off. There were more topping than dog. If you don't like toasted buns, don't go here. I HATE toasted hot dog buns WITH A PASSION and they do it here, without asking if that's what you want. What I make at home was also more tastier. I also asked for a strawberry shake, because, really.... how can you mess up a strawberry shake. Well, they did. It wasn't that cold. It was lumpy with what you might call frozen strawberries but it wasn't cold or thick at all. Almost as if they let ice cream thaw, then scooped it into a glass and let it sit for awhile. EWWWWWWW! Save yourself trouble and got to McDonalds if you're really in a hurry and can't go to the grocery store. The staff is ok, but not on my list of nicest people in the world. I got the feeling there were more concerned with sales than pleasing people. Small parking and one car runner ran into me on the way in. DON'T GO HERE!\n",
      "Drove by after a long run and we were curious... No expectations...and were super happy after! We were pretty hungry, order a Carolina dog and Chicago dog (yum yum). The all beef dogs are excellent and they have a good choice of hot dogs types. The Buckeye shake was delightful, but we love PB and chocolate so you can't go wrong. The fries were basic. Would stop back if ever in the area again!\n",
      "1st try we sat in parking lot with lights on for 15 minutes. No service, no one even looked our way. The only people waited on were the ones under the canopy. No signs anywhere that they only have service under awning. Swenson's services their whole lot! 2nd visit I got a spot under the canopy. Waitress came to car and wanted me to order. No menu boards, no menu, I ordered 2 dogs and Onion Rings. Ordered 1 all beef and 1 natural with the same topping and an order of onion rings to go. Both dogs barely warm and 1 had the correct toppings, the other one had I don't know what on it, some sort of hot relish maybe? Onions rings were the greasiest I've ever had! Great concept that failed to deliver!!\n",
      "Best Chicago Dogs around. Vienna hot dogs would be better, but these are the best we've had in the area! Kind of pricey, but cheaper than driving to Chicago! ;)\n",
      "I love a good hotdog. I was out with my son and we came across this place. It looks like a new place trying to look old. So, the name is perfect. The layout reminded me a lot like sonic and the drive ins back when I was really young. The interior is really nice and I thought they did a great job of decorating. I ordered the Banzai dog and my son ordered the White hot dog. We also decided to get a large order of fries to split and my son got a root beer. We went there about a week ago and my son is still talking about how magnificent the root beer was. He also loved the hot dog, but said it might have been a little salty. I thought that the banzai dog was also fantastic. The banzai sauce is really what makes it. You could put that on just about anything and make it taste good. Plus, its covered with bacon.. Whenever I order fries and I see that they are fresh cut fries, my brain automatically thinks Malt Vinegar. I grabbed one of the containers and took it back to our seat. We were seated along the windows so when the light hit the container, something caught my eye. It looked like there were 2-3 ants floating in the bottom of the container. I took the container back to the counter and gave it to the person there and showed them, told them I thought they were ants. Then I noticed all of the vinegar containers had this substance in them. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the manager shows up with a pan, in which she had poured out the vinegar in to show me they were not ants. She explained that it was a fatty spongy substance that collects in vinegar containers. I told her that I have several different vinegar containers at home, some that I have had for 2+ years and I have never seen this substance. I She said it is common and found it on the internet. So of course I asked the obvious question, \"How long has that vinegar been in those containers that it would have this fatty spongy substance?\" She told me that they empty them every week and refill them. Now, I know I look like I just fell off the yam wagon, but I find it hard to believe that your vinegar forms that in a week and mine hasn't in over 2 years. My ten-year-old was able to ascertain that you were full of crap so needless to say, your excuse needs work. I wasn't asking for a free meal, just say \"Geeze, that's gross.. let me get you a new one.\" Regardless of the vinegar incident and the manager clearly trying to cover her ass, I thought the place was great. I will probably return again if I am in the area, but I think I will skip the fries and vinegar.\n",
      "Talk about living the old car hop idea. Retro Dog has amazing food and awesome service. Their milk shakes are amazing. The flavor combinations are always spot on. You can go in or have the car hop come out and bring you your food. Love it.\n",
      "Delicious natural casing dogs with a variety of toppings, great milkshakes, awesome design. Very happy to have this new addition to the scene. EDIT: After many return visits I can say the quality is consistent and the staff is always very friendly and competent. It has become my favorite \"fast food\" stop. Oh, and try the Retro Burger, it is, dare I say, better than a Swenson's Galley Boy. I know, blasphemy, but true.\n",
      "Nice variety of dogs and burgers. Place has tasty vegetarian alternatives. Come alone, with friends, family or just you and the kids.\n",
      "I was the only car at curbside, yet it took 5 minutes for someone to bring me a menu. I paid $22 plus for a cheeseburger, veggie dog, two orders of fries (which were very small) and 2 shakes. The cheeseburger was not edible. It was fatty and there was so much salt on it that I had to throw it out. While good, the fries were in a really small cup. I could pay the same price and get a large overflowing cup at Five Guys. The only good thing from the whole experience was the free trade coffee shake. Won't be back for the food.\n",
      "Great local joint with an old fashion car hop service or eat in there dining area bar stools and tables. They have great dogs, burgers made to perfection with all kinds of toppings. The dogs are great love the Chicago dog best in the area. The shakes and ice cream can't go wrong and try the old fashion root beer float.\n",
      "This place was gross! The best thing on the hot dog was the mustard I had Conney sauce and Cole slaw and they were no good. And on top of it the Server that came to the car was rude. They didn't say hello...how are you...nothing! They just handed a menu thru the window and said turn on your lights when you're ready to order. Then when we were done they never said how was everything...nothing! Even tho they seen my brothers hot dog only had one bite missing from it because it was so nasty! For a $4 dog and service like that this place doesn't even deserve a 1/4 of a star!!\n",
      "Really great food! A nice variety of hot dogs, toppings, and sauces. They also have burgers and fries. We ordered a footlong dog, a natural casing dog with bacon, and the home on the range fries. Amazing! The fries were a bit spicer than expected, so we \"had\" to order ice cream. Darn. :) Overall, a really great little place. I'll be back soon.\n",
      "If you want to relive your misspent youth, or get a flavor of where to go after the sock hop ends, this is the place. Tasty, tasty hot dogs, hamburgers, and the usual sides, plus milkshakes and other desserts. Pull up and order from your car, or sit outside or inside. I often get a hankerin' for a coney dog in the summer, and I really enjoyed the Retro Dog. Hot dog was perfect and a nice soft bun to keep the coney sauce to hot dog ratio just right. The Carolina dog had a flavorful complement of coleslaw for a mellow blend of dog and vegs. Got cheesy bacon fries, which have some heat due to the spicy fries coating. Onion rings were also good. They are also open late when there are events going on at Blossom.\n",
      "Heard this place was terrible from a family friend & wish I would've taken his opinion to heart. My fiance & I were scouting Retro Dog out for possibly having their food truck for our wedding reception but they instantly failed. I am a french fries queen! I can tell you who has the best fresh cut, frozen, sweet potato, etc fries around and Retro Dog is not one of them. They claim to be fresh cut but they tasted a little frozen. My fries were not raw but were definitely not cooked long enough (no crisp, just limp d*ck). Sadly, bathing them in a small cup of salt & malt vinegar didn't save the day. Then my fiance ordered their Chicago & White dog but said they weren't very good & he could've made better at home. He also ordered their tempura onion rings- F**king disgusting!!!! The onions inside were cut way too thick & therefore weren't cooked all the way. The batter tasted like idk what- a really bad knock off of Arby's curly fries &, again, was undercooked & greasy. Even if I had just gotten off of a crappy 12 hour shift at work with no break and an hour long drive home I wouldn't eat their food. Less than 15 minutes later I got heart burn so... As for their service- not bad, but their Root beer float was the only good thing that I had. But i must admit, I love the concept & the decor- just not the food!\n",
      "Soooooo disappointed. As others had mentioned the onion rings are horrible...just rings of grease. The actual hot dog and burger were tasty...but bread and stuff not so much. I've had better root beer...odd after taste. We gave you a try...there is potential.\n",
      "Good hot dogs. Good root beer. Not a chain. Good times.\n",
      "I was very impressed with RETRO Dog. As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries. I had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings. I chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug. My dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book. We chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly. I highly recommend RETRO Dog. I will definitely be returning to sample the rest of the vegetarian delights and specialty sodas.\n",
      "Here to tell you I think this place is off the hook! I was excited to try it & was not disappointed. At first I thought they were a little pricey, but put things in perspective. The ingrediants are of higher quality than you would think. Went on a Sunday afternoon & it wasn't crowded at all. Four of us sat at the counter and talked to the friendly staff members the whole time. I ordered the Chicago dog & really loved it! Boyfriend got the Carolina dog & he loved it! The boys got the Coney dogs and wanted more. Nom, Nom, Nom... Few things worth noting... I am a designer and I was digging everythig about this place! The layout, the lighting, the surface materials, the graphic design, etc. I can really appreciate all of the nice, clean details this place offers. I even took a pic of the rest room! A+ to the design team! They even have nice, thick, soft napkins which were like a luxury! I want to work here just so I can get a red pair of Converse! Seriously, I love their uniforms, very cool. If they sold their shirts I would buy one! Love the artwork & colors. Again, well done & kudos to the artist!\n",
      "(6-18-12) My daughter had a Noon appointment not far away - pulled in at 11:05am figuring a hot dog joint should be able to get us in and out within 30 minutes. Boy was i wrong I had to FLAG DOWN a server @ 11:40 just to take back the menu since i knew we wouldn't have time to order and eat. I sat there with my lights on from 11:20 until 11:40 waiting for someone to take my order. Several servers looked like they were afraid to talk to people as they run back and forth looking at the ground. At one point i counted 6 cars under the canopy with lights on and no one around. One employee stood in the front of the building (apparently on break) just looking at all the cars with lights on. MANAGER NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I will try again as they are new and hopefully everyone will be better trained.\n",
      "Overall fantastic place. The decor is very cool and the food is good. Even if you are not a fan of hot dogs, they do have burgers (including a black bean burger!) and chicken options. I had the original retro dog- diced onions, chili, and cheese. It was quite yummy. There was a hint of cinnamon in the chili that I could have done without but it was still delicious! My combo also came with a side of home-style fries which were surprisingly crunchy as well as tasty. Retro dog also offers a variety of retro sodas- cream soda, black cherry, root beer and so on. The root beer is actually their own recipe and made locally. It was a sweeter take on root beer than most places, so if you like sweet pop, you will definitely be a fan :) plus it comes in a frosted mug, just like all root beer should! Customer service was fine, seems they have worked out any kinks they may have had since opening earlier this summer. I know I will be going back!\n",
      "I recently dined here and was very disappointed. I have dined at many different hot dog establishments and this one was overpriced in my opinion. The fries were over seasoned, making them very salty and inedible. I enjoyed the snap of the hot dog, but didn't find it to be a hot dog I would throughly enjoy eating again. I also had a float, it was ok but I feel it was overpriced. 2 fries, 1 hot dog, 1 foot long and 2 floats equated to almost $30. Sorry to say, I won't be coming back.\n",
      "Loved it since it opened. Everything's great but be sure to ask for your dog ungrilled if you don't like the charring. I like it like that but my kids don't.\n",
      "This place is good. The hot dogs are excellent and the burgers are good. They seem like decent people and are friendly. My biggest complaint is that it is a bit on the expensive side. We go here fairly regularly.\n",
      "I have to rate my visit as a 3 this evening (unfortunately). And really that's pushing it. The hotdogs were excellent; however, the fries were over salted and oily, the onion rings were dripping in grease. Very little onion and way too much batter. Please, please change your oil! The root beer floats - well let's break that down; root beer was great but the custard ice-cream seemed to have ice chips in it. Not creamy, but \"ice milky\". Lastly Retro Dog should have \"Retro\" music. Stick with the dogs and you may enjoy your visit.\n",
      "I didn't get a hot dog, but I did get the ice cream sandwich. I would give just the ice cream sandwich five stars! The butter pecan and caramel cookie ice cream sandwich was recommended to me by the cashier. She did not lead me astray. Two huge cookies with ice cream (which was at least 1.5 inches thick). I would go back just for that delightful treat. I also got the chocolate malt, which was very good, but not great. Everything else looked decent in the pictures, but I did not partake.\n",
      "Retro Dog is a cool place to stop if you are out in the Cuyahoga Valley or at Blossom and feel like a snack or some ice cream. Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area. The decor is bright and in your face in a good way, kind of a very modern expression of a 50's diner. The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts. I have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great. The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun. The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili. The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp. The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked. The 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream. The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try. The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt. Overall good shakes, especially using soft serve ice cream as the base. Retro Dog is probably not worth a special trip or the place for a full meal, but if you are in the area and need a snack it is worth a try.\n",
      "The Red Hot was very soggy. My bun fell apart. The Chicago Dog has good flavor, but the wiener was nothing to write home about. Overpriced and flies all over.\n",
      "Great service, OK food. It seemed like everything was just a little off. I had the Retro Dog and onion rings and the hubs got the Carolina Dog with fries. The hot dog itself was really good... Mellow taste, nice snap... but the coney sauce was a turn off. Very sweet, not much spice. My husband said his Carolina dog was good, but he said he would try something else next time. The onion rings really had me excited because they looked perfect... they weren't. The spices in the tempura overwhelmed any onion flavor that might have been there and they were SO GREASY! I ate one and a half rings and had to stop. The fries were just OK too and needed to have salt added to them. They had a really nice natural potato flavor but they tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while, which seems implausible considering how busy they were. We also ordered the root beer and the flavor was not unpleasant, but it was very flat. Considering how very sweet it is, it could have used more carbonation. I would like to return to Retro Dog and try a dog with just mustard. Of course, we also need to try the custard!\n",
      "I really wanted this place to be amazing. The food is just okay. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't find a WOW factor. I do feel like it is REALLY expensive. For my boyfriend, daughter and I, we can drop $25 easily and thats not getting a lot of food. At all. I do find the service to be hit or miss too.\n",
      "This was our second time here. The first time we came the service was slow and they kept forgetting parts of our order. It wasn't even busy. The coney sauce wasn't very good on our first visit so this time ordered our stuff without it which was much better. The service this time was better but we also ate inside too. Their custard and fries were great both visits!\n",
      "Nice little \"drive-in\" diner. It's literally in the middle of nowhere but worth the trip. We went on the behest of my brother in law, and couldn't have been more satisfied. Actually ordered a couple hot dogs and the wife got a burger. The meat was seasoned well (pause) and the dogs were grilled perfectly. Ordered the loaded fries (tip: you can go for the regular size portion if sharing with another person, it's plenty!) and was stuffed the rest of the day and we ate there at 5PM. Staff was super friendly and helpful with our order. Will definitely be back. To get more food, because why not?!\n",
      "BING BANG BOOM BABY! This place is baller. From the Chicken Sandwich to the Hot Dog to the kick Ass Shakes. I love this place! Gets me feeling craZy!!!! Killer stop after cruising the valley on your mid 90s hog. Seedable-\n",
      "Cool LOOKING place but about $25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was WAYYYYY TOOO MUCH MONEY and while it was a cool looking place....I would NOT go back only because of the sky high prices.\n",
      "Owner could not even take the time to address concerns with management and bullying of employees. Terrible treatment, service, and management. Will NEVER get my business again.\n",
      "Went there on a Monday. Placed looked like a slow night. The selections were interesting and the fries Tasty. Got two of there special dogs(Chicago and Bonzai). Buns were very stale and i think the dog was on the griddle a little too long. If I'm in the neighborhood I might give them a try gain but nothing I would go out of my way for. On a positive note the Employees working were very attentive and nice.\n",
      "What can I say about the food. It's awesome. Great family atmosphere. The onion rings are amazing and even the chicken sandwich is good. But skip that, grab a dog.\n",
      "It's an unusually warm day, almost 60 degrees, and I thought you need to go eat at a drive-in and take in the balmy day. I've been to Retro Dog once, not long after it opened, and I wasn't impressed but I thought give it another shot. This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me. Anyway, as to the food, it was just ok and pricey for the quality, $10.55 for a bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and small Coke. Nothing I couldn't have made at home better. No next time for Retro Dog.\n",
      "Even though I planned my weekend in the Akron area around burger joints, beer and baseball, I couldn't pass up a hot dog place so close to my hotel. You know, just for a snack. For some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day. I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog. I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard. I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer. I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer). I took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day. I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected. This was going to be more than a snack. I took a bite. And instantly my brain thought, \"This doesn't taste like a hot dog.\" Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog. The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities. And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it. Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog. The root beer was aces. I still regret not splurging on that growler. I've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it. If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs. I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts. Seems like my kind of place.\n",
      "I am a vegetarian. The veggie dog was not that good. It tasted a bit...old or dry maybe. The veggie chili was also a bit dry and very salty. There were lentils in it, but there just wasn't enough moisture to make it that enjoyable or enough cheese to save it.\n",
      "Great concept. Food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts. Drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating. Firepit for cooler nights. Plan on visiting many more times. Onion rings are fantastic, hot dogs are good, chicken sandwiches are great!\n",
      "Eaten here a handful of times. The hot dogs are good. They have nice snap when you bite into them. Burger decent. Nice to go to when your going to or coming back from Blossom. Root beer is good too. Worth a try. Use the coupons you get. I think the prices could be a bit better. But I'm cheap so I don't like to pay a lot for a hot dog. It's just a hot dog... But worth the try to see if you like it. Eat inside. Too messy to eat in your car. But it's cool to eat in your car so if you don't care then go for it.\n",
      "I've been to Retro Dog several times including before, on and after the grand opening on June 17th. I'm not sure what people expect from a brand new concept restaurant in this area that's not even a franchise. I, myself, being a reasonable and realistic person who also manages people for a living, was prepared for the imperfections in service. The great part is there's already significant progress being made. The food is really good. I've had the retro dog, the white hot, and kraut dog (so far, my fav), and am starting to have some fun building my own. The bean burger is very interesting and tasty! The veggie dog is also really good. I love that they have healthier, vegetarian options. But the ultimate is the Retro Dip. This is a cone of amazing deliciousness. Who knew I'd look forward to the very bottom of the cone as much as the top?\n",
      "Randomly found this place after a concert at Blossom and overall I enjoyed it. Service is quick and food is out quickly as well. I like the fact that they bake their own buns, definitely creates a different experience. Personally, I'm a chili cheese dog man and was sad to see none on the menu. Never had tried a coney dog prior, instinctively I ordered one as well as a Chicago dog. As far as taste goes, it was definitely tasty, just not in the sense that I'm use to. The Chicago dog was excellent and PACKED with overflowing toppings and tasted great! My SO got a coney dog as well and pretty much shared the same experience. She's a chili cheese dog person too. I know.. we're meant to be together haha. Fries were fresh and their onion rings were unique and intimidating but definitely delicious! Loved every bite. And last but not least, their MILKSHAKES. Thick and flavorful, just like a traditional milkshake should be. Chocolatey goodness!!!! I'd definitely come back again!\n",
      "Traveling through town, we were looking for an inexpensive, quick, unique place for lunch. This is certainly it. Wonderful hot dogs and great frozen custard. The atmosphere is great but the highlight had to be the onion rings. Wonderful batter, crispy and delicious. Would certainly recommend this place. Our family of 4 ate lunch for about $34 without custard.\n",
      "I just loved this place! Neat atmosphere and the entire staff was friendly and helpful! I got the Hula Burger and BLT Fries - loved the hula sauce and burger! The fries were very good too - but next time I'd get the fries with hula sauce on them. They have very cool ice cream options too! One of cups has a sundae at the bottom and a milk shake poured over it! I can't wait to take my family here! These kind of burger/hot dog joints are my new favorite places to find!\n",
      "Huge disappointment. Great concept, great atmosphere. However, food was less than. Hot dog and fries were overcooked to the point of being burnt. The onion rings were the only good part of our meal. It was sad as our expectations were high.\n",
      "I have never had a negative experience here! Quick service, food is ready quickly, servers are sweet. Cream soda is addicting! The hot dogs and burgers are delish! We have been coming here since they opened. Only thing we have never done is go inside to eat. It's always so fun eating in the car with the kids!! You should eat here!!\n",
      "When I drove by I had high hopes. Not so much after stopping in. The dogs were just ok. I got the White Hot and a regular with Coney sauce. The wife got a Kraut dog. We each had an order of fries. Mine were the garlic Parmesan hers were the rosemary. We couldn't tell the difference between the two. There was not enough salt/flavoring on either of them to tell the difference. The Coney sauce tasted burnt. The Kraut dog was just okay. The white hot was just fine. And last of all the prices were very high. We wont be back which is a shame. The decor is great. The service was fine. The place could be great it just needs some work and better quality control and 15 to 20% lower pricing.\n",
      "very good tasting hot dogs, a lot of options for toppings. a little bit more expensive than you'd want just for hot dogs, but the atmosphere is awesome and there's a lot of menu choices. I would recommend.\n",
      "I normally like retro spots like these. This one didn't really wow me. The food is extremely greasy, kind of flavorless and they cover all the ice cream in chocolate syrup. The service was pretty speedy and I've never seen it jam packed so you can get in and out quickly. Decent place for a quick bite or if you live in the neighborhood and want to walk up it would be a nice little walk.\n",
      "The beef hot dog tasted like a regular pork hot dog. No\"snap\". Very disappointing. The fries were good. I won't be back.\n",
      "Chicago dog was delicious. My husband had a double cheeseburger was probably the best cheeseburger Ive had in while.\n",
      "My significant other and I have been frequenting this establishment since it opened. We could probably walk there in less than ten minutes. He loves the natural casing hot dogs and I love the Retro burger. Both are an incredible quality at a great price. They also have some of the best seasoned fries around. I throughly enjoy all of their frozen treats as well. They make a frozen custard marble that is amazing, with any topic you can think of, plus their milkshake selection is seriously impressive. I dig the curb side dining experience, and Retrodog is doing it much better than any of the other competitors around. The staff is always sweet, quick and you can tell that they enjoy working there. Great customer service. Oh yeah, and they make homemade root beer that is very good and unique. It's a must try. I'll never go back to a Swensons/Skyway/A&W ever again. The quality of food alone makes them stand out above the competition. IMO they are the number one burger/hotdog/fries experience in the Akron area.\n",
      "This place is great! The white hot (veal/pork) dog is amazing! The shakes are amazing and their hula ghost burger BLEW MY MIND! made with a ghost chili sauce with bacon, grilled onion and pineapple makes for a burger that's out of this world!\n",
      "Seriously. Banzai burger. Best I have ever ever had. Everything at this old school/new school place...reasonable prices and tasty service...\n",
      "I tried this place today and it was really good! I ordered the retro veggie dog and cheese fries. The retro dog was really good it came with chili, mustard and onions. Being an all vegetarian meal I was pretty pleased. The cheese fries were fantastic! Crispy and the cheese was yum! We will be back.\n",
      "This was a nice change of pace from our typical road trip meal stops, but it was nothing that blew my socks off. The dog was fairly tasteless (I'd rather have my store-bought Hebrew National any day) and while the toppings were decent, it was nothing that made me say WOW, I WANT ANOTHER. I tried the home brew root beer and again, it was decent, but I like Barqs better. The best part of the meal was the fries. So, an A-OK stop and if I lived close I'd definitely try other menu options...but as a one-off stop, it didn't thrill me as much as I'd hoped.\n",
      "Save your money. Onion rings were dripping in grease! Hamburger had no flavor. My third time here it's good in theory, just not in execution.\n",
      "Was down in the area for some hiking and remembered seeing some good things about this place. Retro Dog is really in the middle of nowhere which explains why it wasn't so busy but easy enough to get to once you know what streets to take. The car hoppers came out very quick, gave us the extensive menu, and came back out just as quickly when we were ready to order. The shakes were DELICIOUS and the hot dogs were very good too. Good choice of bun as well. The fries with cheese sauce and bacon were also very good. Overall, my wife and I definitely enjoyed it. We put it right up next to Swenson's as one of our favorite places to go for food. Very good!\n",
      "Did a Hula burger, it was different but pretty good. Onion rings are awesome! Coleslaw was not all that good.\n",
      "Man do I love Retro Dog!! This awesome mom and pop business does not disappoint. It's a hot dog place, so of course the dogs are wonderful (my favorite is the Carolina) but that doesn't mean you should shy away from the burgers! Whenever I'm really hungry I get a Hula burger. Provolone cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, bacon, and a pineapple slice all doused in this incredible spicy hula sauce. Yum! Don't forget to save room for custard! Not ice cream, but delicious, creamy custard. There is not a single thing on the desert menu that I wouldn't get. The service is very friendly and helpful! They genuinely seem to be very happy at this establishment. Not the usual disgruntled employees. The managers are just as wonderful! Always making sure you're happy, and that your visit is a good one. This place is unlike any other restaurant I've been to, and I always recommend it to anyone who is ever going through that area. I love retro dog!\n",
      "I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews! I went for the grand opening and while we waited for our food it was so worth the wait. I'm a hot dog snob, expect to pay more for it and was not disappointed. The natural casing dog was perfectly crisped in the outside, flavorful on the inside. I ordered the Kraut Dog, kraut, pickles, mustard, delicious! We shared the chili fries that really hit the spot and finished it off with their house root beer. I'll definitely be going back to try the rest if the menu soon... Especially the chili dog.\n",
      "We were here on a weekday afternoon. I had a white hot dog and my companions had Chicago dogs. Mine was acceptable. Their hot dogs were not great. If you strip away the bun and the toppings, the hot dogs should be amazing. They were very flat. There is a huge difference between cheap hot dogs and flavorful hot dogs and these were generic at best. The hand cut fries were decent but not amazing. The onion rings were awful, full of grease, and well done. The dip for the onion rings would be better if it was a full flavor mustard. The service was quick. The prices and portions were acceptable until we ate the food. We were seriously disappointed.\n",
      "This place was great. I don't understand the poor reviews. One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. Milkshake was solid as well. And the poor waitress braved a monsoon to take our order quickly. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Excellent local restaurant for grilled American fare. The selection of burgers, hot dogs, shakes and fried foods is just incredible. There are also vegetation options (dogs and burgers) which is greatly appreciated! The place is clean and neat, and the service is quick and modernized (they use iPhones to ring you out). One minor issue - the hot dogs and burgers are great, but the buns themselves are either too big or too soggy. The food is incredible, but a better bun makes a even better sandwich.\n",
      "I can't believe some of the complaints on here! Retro dog is awesome plain and simple, if you don't like something you picked out build your own meal! They offer that. Any who, never have had a bad meal, in fact we drive from North Royalton/Strongsville just to have there food! There hot dogs &&& burgers are to die for, seriously! The prices I don't mind at all either because I work at a family establishment and times are tough and so are soaring prices in the food industry! We love you retro dog!\n",
      "Harold and Kumar traveled how far for these dumb burgers... Totally not worth the hype. My ex stoner roommate was obsessed with White Castle and used to buy the frozen ones.. So when I tried these for the 1st time I couldn't believe how it tastes exactly the same (yuk) People were buying them by the case when we walked in, total disappointment. People in the east coast got it all wrong these soggy sliders are crappy. Another reason the west coast rules.\n",
      "Need to be a teenager, drunk, or stoned. It took 15 minutes for a single to go original slider. Greasy, heavy on sautéed onion, very thin patty with very little texture... I'll take a McDonald's hamburger any day. Looked better in the movies.\n",
      "This is seriously overrated!! They are really just burgers mini sized. My fiance scarfed down 4 mini burgers. Their fries were gross. It was not salted. I ordered their chicken rings and it was really just chicken nuggets in a different shape. AND it's expensive!\n",
      "Set your expectations really low when coming here and you might not hate yourself too much for spending your well earned dollars here. There was nothing memorable about having them. We came here for the novelty of trying it out just once for the sake of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle. I'll give it an extra star because I think these things would make great drunken munchie meals, but then again, so would everything else.\n",
      "Yes, there is now a White Castle located on the strip in Las Vegas. Everyone who wants to try them without going to the Midwest/East coast can now have a taste of the well known slider. I have enjoyed White Castle before in Chicago and found that they are quite tasty and I can put a few back. My cousin always orders them with extra pickles. I should have remembered that when eating them in Vegas. I forgot that tidbit, but they were still really good. I really wish they had a location in Denver. That would make my year. The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer. What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate. If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time.\n",
      "Got to get em hot fresh off the grill! No you can't take these Lil babies home. They get cold quick. They don't sit on your belly all day. It's a reason people in Saint Louis call them sliders. Lol Yes my husband is from Saint Louis so I have a degree in the fine art of White Castle. You order these when their is a long line. You sit and eat them. I enjoy them most when I have been dancing all night and the club is closed and it's 3am. And all my friends meet up to have these. Omg the fries are great with cheese. And the breakfast sandwich is devine. I give them five stars!\n",
      "Thoroughly enjoyed the Midwest sliders. Freshly made and tasty. Brought back memories from Chicago late night slider runs. They have onion \"chip\" rather than full onion rings. Think onion rings cut into pieces. And being Las Vegas, this White Castle serves beer - keep that buzz going! Friendly staff and a dining room cleaning crew that was constantly keeping the place clean.\n",
      "Very small restaurant capitalizing off the brand's nostalgia and charm. They sell their signature miniature \"slider\" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again. If you are nearby in the area, take a look!\n",
      "More of a nostalgia thing for me growing up in Minneapolis and eating them as a kid. Price seemed always right and always fresh and delicious. That thing they do with the onions is over the top. Not as good a burger as I remember as a kid but maybe I have eaten too many celebrity chef burgers and acquired a different taste. Hard to park to get there but if you're in the neighborhood pick up a few and enjoy. Fast and friendly service and smells great.\n",
      "Ok so I'm not from the east coast so I've tried many burgers in Vegas and I was pretty disappointed with these. Food: Cheese sliders- 2/5 I ordered the cheese sliders. The burgers were small and pricey. I didn't like the smell of them and I didn't like how it tasted like a burger from any other franchised restaurant. Nothing stood out for me. Chicken rings- 1/5 Seriously don't get these. They are crispy but flavorless and super thin. Honestly thought McDonalds chicken nuggets were better. French fries- 2/5 Fries were a bit soggy. But these were my favorite out of all the stuff I ordered. Service is GOOD! 4/5: Expect a long wait. I waited in line for more than an hour but I got my food in less than 5 mins! They are friendly and efficient!! They try to make the wait bearable by talking to you, which I thought was neat. Overall if your a person who likes a burger with flavor and who has ate many flavorful burgers, White Castle isn't for you. I was quite disappointed but many other people love the simplicity of their food. This joint just wasn't for me.\n",
      "The wait is long, but definitely worth it! I wish there was one in So. Cal so I can have it more often than twice a year. The service is definitely quick and accommodating.\n",
      "I really don't get the whole hype about this place. I mean it's a bit different in the way they serve their burgers but I felt I couldn't really enjoy it entirely because they serve them in bite-size pattys. I was hoping it would of felt like a meal but honestly it felt like a mid-day snack before lunch. Fries are good but I don't think I will be coming back to try it again. Unless someone can convince me that there is a must try item on their menu. I'll stick to regular in n out. Service here was horrible. The one thing that did bug me was when our order was called. My friend was already heading to pick it up and the lady begins to speak on the Mic. \"Number ???, you will find your number if you have looked in your receipt on the bottom part of it.\" And I mean she said it with an attitude as if we didn't know it was there. So unnecessary and uncalled for.\n",
      "Got the #1 - 4 Regular burger pack w fries and drink $7.99. I wish I got the cheeseburger it has more flavor the regular was a bit dry. But nevertheless it was fluffy buns, grilled onions and tasty. I realized there is no real sauce in these burgers but grilled onions gave it flavor. I've tried the frozen ones it's similar but these were more fluffy buns and softer meat patty the frozen ones were drier.\n",
      "This place is literally the worst place I have ever been. (Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable. However, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around. Each time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough. Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order. Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order. Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars. If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order. Once a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems. I strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.\n",
      "Im from NY and loved it there, but this was not as I remembered. I bought a crave case, all the burgers were warm and dry like eating toast. They all had some kind of freezer burn marks on the edges of the patty. I remembered it being steamy and delicious, I hope they improve because I love WC!\n",
      "Listen folks....White Castle is not for everyone. If you're curious about these little cooked to order sliders just try one or two at the most. I definitely don't recommend a full meal. Vegas location means Vegas prices. It may not be worth it to you. Now for all the lovers & fans of this tasty little spot..... be prepared for greatness! Its always super busy here which is assurance that everything is fresh, hot, & ready to go. They ppl here a great system to get you in & out. You can even see them cooked the burgers, grill the onions, & steam the buns while placing your order....but i must warn you...be prepared to pay Vegas prices. Hope this helps!\n",
      "I've always wanted to try this place BC people always says it's good. Well they were right. I love the fish and chicken breast burgers.\n",
      "white castle is a horrible place to work! my son n law worked his first shift and was locked in a freezer multiple times,made fun of because Edward and Francisco didn't like his name,they refused to teach to teach him his job even though they were suppose to train him, and he didn't get a lunch or breaks until the two boys got off shift and an actual manager was working and gave him a lunch break his last he of work! I will most definitely be contacting an attorney! go back to the east coast white castle we don't need companies like yours here if your going to treat people poorly! remember bullying is not tolerated!\n",
      "First of all this opened 15 hours ago. The wait was not that long considering I ordered a crate w/cheese (100 sliders w/cheese). The manager maintained eye contact with everyone on line (less than 20 people at 530am). I seen over 400 burgers leave in the 15 minutes I was there. The place was clean and I could not smell smoke (it's inside a casino).\n",
      "We have eaten the White Castle freezer pack sliders and I was curious to see the most western White Castle location in Las Vegas. None in California. The sliders are almost identical except for 2 things: these ones contain a pickle and the bun is more moist, some were soggy. I got super indigestion after eating 4 of these guys. It was nice to try once in person but that's it.\n",
      "Cute little burgers. Good ratio of onions and pickles. Kind of wish it had already come with ketchup or mayo inside. I guess this place is really only for those who know what to expect. If not, kind of setting yourself up for failure.\n",
      "We finally tried White Castle. The line was unbelievably long. The service was friendly and quick in helping. The hamburger was different then any burger I have eaten. Their very simple and tiny. The burger is super thin and small which includes a pickle and a few chopped onions. The bun is super soft but delicious. The combination of cheap and small makes you want to come back for more. Unfortunately you will need to order quite a few in order to feel full. Sometimes simple is better. There is no glamour to these burgers. The restaurant is full of people with happy smiles. Unfortunately the location needs to be cleaned more often after people eat at the tables.\n",
      "I like this place. The workers have great customer service and their services are fast. I seen a couple complaints that this place is similar to the frozen stuff. Um.. yeah... shouldnt it be?? If i owned a restaurant and decided to sell my food to the grocery stores, i would want it to taste like it was the same as dining in. Las Vegas is a tourists city and I'm very grateful for restaurants from around the world to land here. It's very welcoming for those that moved out here and miss what they grew up with.\n",
      "I agree with most people that White Castle is a bit overrated. The fries are akin to the ones you got in grade school cafeterias. The sliders are tasty. The service was good. We came by at 11am on a Monday and ordered a 10 slider pack. There was only one couple in front of us but we got our food within a minute after ordering.\n",
      "Oh my... As a person who has at times struggled with weight I have to say that going to the Las Vegas White Castle location was the biggest boost of self confidence. The average circumference of the people that were there to eat was over the morbidly obese range...one guy had a gut that was drooping over his shorts. And I saw a few order the 100 burger box...I actually couldn't help myself but stare several times...I felt instant guilt and wondered how many children in the Philippines were hungry I liked the burgers but after seeing what can't be unseen...I won't be going back and I'll be heading to church to pray and to the gym to run\n",
      "My mom use to buy these babies at the grocery store all the time but I finally got to try this place out! I loved it!! I am sure people love it when they are drunk as well but I was sober when I ate these! The ones at the market do not have pickles in them but these do. The taste so good with the cheese!! Their fries are pretty good too as well as their fried onion things. Kinda like onion rings. I would definitely come back! Too bad they don't sell it in singles. NOTE: -Extra charge for cheese (30 cents each)\n",
      "So, I came here the last week I was living in Vegas hoping that it would be as amazing as Harold and Kumar show in their movie about how amazing White Castle is. I literally went on a journey from Reno to Las Vegas, then finally got to White Castle with high hopes. Yea there was a long line (its Vegas, there are long lines everywhere and long wait times in Vegas on the strip). We got our food quickly, but oh my gawd it was disgusting. I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way. The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying. Definitely really expensive and not worth the price. Dont expect to have that amazing experience there, unless you are super drunk or high and dont care what you put in your mouth. Fries were ok.\n",
      "This place is great for a late night drink food run. The line can be long but is worth it. If you do come with a large group order the large pack.\n",
      "There is nothing special about this place. Read the Yelp Reviews and trust them! Do not come here! Harold and Kumar promoted this place like no other so everyone had to come try them, I was one of those people. The sliders are worse than the ones sold in the frozen foods section. It is small and will fit into the size of your palm. The bread was slightly warm and soggy. The patty was dry. The small pickle was lying naked alongside small speckles of onions. It was not tasty at all. I had to squeeze a full bag of ketchup on it to give it life. For a dollar something each, I would rather walk myself to a McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu. My boyfriend and I decided to come here because it was 5am and he was starving. Shake Shack and Rasising Canes were both closed so White Castle it was. The next morning, my boyfriend and I woke up with bad tummyaches. Luckily, our hotel had two bathrooms....\n",
      "White Castles are not a common sight in Los Angeles county. Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle! So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long. As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'. There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter. I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside. Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed. Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.\n",
      "I turned the corner and there it was--HOLY SQUARE BURGERS, ITS WHITE CASTLE! Been living in Washington for almost 20 years now and when I saw that blue and white--ITS WHITE CASTLE! I know when I walk through the pearly gates, right next to the NY Pizza place will be a White Castle!\n",
      "No. It's over rated because of its reputation but the food is not good. A single slider was 2.50 and that's as much as a burger at in-n-out. This is a \"only choice\" type of eat. Don't eat here if you have other options. Not to mention it's the only one in Vegas and for locals the parking and ordering and dealing with all those tourists is too ridiculous.\n",
      "I expected better from here. The sliders weren't that tasty and became a chore to eat after a while. The chicken rings tasted like frozen dino nuggets (not even as good as Dino nuggets). I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious. Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself. It just didn't meet my expectations.\n",
      "I went there yesterday line was long, that wasn't the problem. The problem was there was no communication or organization. They were selling milkshakes and didn't even have them ready me and several other people had to wait a little too long for the rude manager. The lady screaming out the orders was very unorganized and rude. They need a better way of putting the food out when it's ready. And the worst part was when I get home I find out that one of the bags was burnt, it was like somebody left it next to a warmer and was like oops let me just put the bag where they can't see it. Really? You are gonna sell burnt burgers and bags? The only positive thing was I did get my 30 burgers quickly and before other people, even though it was BURNT!! Seriously I never had so many problems in one place.\n",
      "First time trying this burger joint and it didn't disappoint us. For a family of 3, it was me, my wife & our 3 year old, i ordered the 4 cheeseburger sliders combo and extra 2 cheeseburger slider. I thought it was enough for us, but I had to order a few more lol. For me its best to eatitwhen it is still warm, everything just melts in ur mouth, and im craving for it right now again while writing this review. I ordered a $5 chocolate shake too and that was also good! Their service is really fast and food quality is great, that is why for me, they deserve a 5-star rating. At the time that we were there, there was a good amount of people. When I paid for my food they gave me a number, i went to go get my drink, a minute or two after, they called my number right away, so i was very satisfied. Its a small dining area, so It might be a little hard for you if you come here when there is a lot of people. When I come back to Vegas, I would definitely come back here.\n",
      "11 years! That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it. Spoiler: It kind of is. The meat is really nothing special here. It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin. What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location. The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor. They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra. No frills needed, or really requested for that matter. The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for. This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy. I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality. In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me. A quick bite when I don't really care about what I'm eating the way most fast food is. On the Vegas strip however, this is probably my new favorite stop during the night or before I get some sleep!\n",
      "I've always wanted to try a White Castle and this is the only place in western US. The burgers are more like small sliders, so order a few of them. They come with pickles and grilled onions, but they are very tasty! I also ordered 'onion chips'; Its like onion rings but in French fry form. They are really good. The service was quick, the prices were reasonable (considering it's on the strip). I would definitely come back.\n",
      "I've been wanting to try this place WAY before Harold & Kumar made it cool. I was pretty excited to hear that one opened up in Vegas. I've had friends who've gone to New York & eat it & they basically told me \"What you see, is what you get.\" True to word. I wasn't disappointed though. The line was ridiculous but it went by fast. We ordered almost everything on the menu & it was done pretty quick. The cheeseburgers were pretty good, the fries were lame, the onion chips WERE DELISH, the chicken rings were okay. I mean, its a fast food place - I don't know what people were really expecting.. lol.\n",
      "Tiny burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS). Good flavor mainly attributed to the grilled onions but these things are small. The patty is paper thin. Makes me wonder if I'm ingesting beef or any kind of real meat for that matter. I'm not a big girl, but I swear I could have killed like 20 burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS) if our group didn't already have reservations for Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse. I was there for Superbowl and this location had just opened so the wait was pretty ridiculous over the weekend but we waited in line in the late afternoon so our wait wasn't as bad. We waited about 30 minutes and thankfully not in the Vegas heat.\n",
      "OMFG.... I had low expectations for this place AND it still managed to underwhelm me. I've never had White Castle being from NorCal there isn't any close by. Ordered the #1 combo: 4 sliders, fries, drink. I couldn't even finish all the sliders... didn't want to ruin my appetite for a redemption dinner. If you never had White Castle, don't worry you're not missing out on anything. Not even worth a try!\n",
      "If I could give White Castle a negative star I would. I can't believe this place exists. We had a gift card and wanted to try it out. We ordered 40 mini sliders, fries and onion rings. The meat didn't even look or taste like meat, it was horrible. Everything was soggy and not eatable it felt like I was eating something foreign. The best part about the meal was the Powerade. Very upsetting.\n",
      "I'm so glad we don't have these in Niagara Falls. These were the greasiest blandest fast food burgers iv'e ever had and they weren't cheap for what you got.\n",
      "The hype was there. I think it was overly hyped but I get it a little. We parked at the Venetian and walked outside by where Sephora was at and its tucked in a little casino. But you will be able to see the White Castle sign. When we got there the lines were not as busy like we hoped it would be. It took me a long time to come just because the hype made it impossible to come. Thank god we waited though. We ordered 20 like cheeseburgers sliders. They also has beer for you beer drinkers. They are like I expected little tiny cheeseburgers with 1 pickle Alice and some onions. For some reason it did taste good. But it taste like how the frozen one would taste at a grocery store. Although those sliders were tiny I did get start to get full off 3. I probably won't be returning here unless one of my tourist family members want to try it out. It wasn't a horrible experience I just feel like there's nothing special about White Castle. Maybe it's better on the East Coast!\n",
      "We drive up from the Phoenix area for White Castle. Husband is a WC freak! I grew up in No Cal, so I only knew from the movies. ;) He says they are far better than the microwave / grocery store heat and eat. We did a drive across the good ol' USA last summer (from coast to coast) and I honestly can't tell the difference between Las Vegas and St Louis. Which is a good thing. They taste the same here as they did on the East Coast.\n",
      "For starters...for all the people giving it low stars because of the wait they had to endure yesterday (this review is being written the day after the Grand Opening), you're all morons. Seriously. What in the world did you expect? As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some. I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time. I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger. The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart. Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said \"we're soldiers!\". I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name. My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing. I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip. A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations. I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location. Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers. They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us. I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries. Large sodas ($2.99) were separate. The bill came out to $38.88. I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame. For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at. Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA. That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items. They could've easily included the soda. I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).\n",
      "College at Ohio State and these things were a regular food item for us. I haven't had a \"fresh\" one in 15 years! These were the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Are they kinda crappy? Yes, but if you're from Ohio you get it. You know why we love them. The atmosphere isn't so great, homeless walking up to you asking for money is a bit of a downer when you're relishing your first bite in over a century but it's Vegas, so whatever.\n",
      "This place shouldn't receive any stars. My husband and I were looking forward to their great food. When we finally had a chance to go, the service was horrible and the food was worse than hospital food. The burgers meat were tasteless and the fries were soggy. Their soda machine had post-its on every other drink being out of order. Plus, we both ended up getting a stomach ache and the runs that night.\n",
      "Exactly like the frozen, eating them At 5am in Vegas didn't even improve the taste. Have know idea what hArold or kumar were all hyped about. Shitz wack!!!!\n",
      "I never heard of White Castle till I watched Harold and Kumar. It never dawned to me till I seen it while in Vegas. The line gets really long (which is normal on the Strip). They are small portions so get a few. It is kinda pricey but I thought it was really good. I would choose White Castle over Innout any day now..\n",
      "Soooo disappointed! Harold and Kumar don't know what a good burger tastes like... sliders tasted like it was microwaved I threw it away I couldn't take another bite. Just thinking about those nasty onions makes my stomach turn ... BLAH!\n",
      "It's White Castle and since there none in California and you need your White Castle craving you might as well stand in line and eat your steamed sliders. It's located at a smaller casino called Casino Royale which is sandwiched between the Venetian and Harrahs. Some people love these sliders, I'm not a big fan but my boyfriend loves them even bought a 10 pack to bring back to home. They sell packs of 10, 30 and even 100.\n",
      "A east coast comfort food that reminds you how sometimes, you need some cheap food to fulfill your needs. It just so happens Vegas isn't a place to fulfill your needs. If your drunk, gambled all your money, desperate and hungry. This is the spot. Other than that if your in the west coast and desperate for some white castle fast food drop on by like I did.\n",
      "The only times I've ever been here is when I / my friends have had a lot to drink. So from that aspect, its very good drunk food. The staff is for the most part very patient which I appreciate b/c I know they deal with jerks all the time. My major complain is the cleanliness of the sitting area which is very small, it can get pretty gross in there and had it been cleaner I would have given it an additional star.\n",
      "Shit, for the price we paid I assumed that when I ate it, i'd taste the damn meat instead it felt like I was eating only the bun. Their meat is as flat and thin as the cheese..... I enjoyed more seeing the options of drinks than I did eating the meal... Fries were not salted and tables were dirty and filled with a lot of mess from previous people.\n",
      "Right next to Harrah's along the strip. Sure, you don't have to go to the East Coast for this. On the other hand, you're better off getting something else. The sliders were alright. Ended up getting the 20-pack with two fries. Add cheese to them and it's a little extra. Also ordered some mozzarella sticks. Total came to just under $40. If you buy the slider packs, it would be cheaper than buying 2 or 3 meals that come with maybe 3 sliders and a drink and fries. Up to you what you wanna do. It's good to try. But I'm probably going to skip this and find another 24-hour place for something quick.\n",
      "White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot. I grew up with White Castle burgers and I love them. They are unique. They do not taste like any other burgers you may have eaten. They are 'steam' grilled and this gives them a unique flavor and texture. If you go to White Castle with any kind of preconceived notions of what a burger is supposed to taste like, you will be disappointed. This is where the negative reviews come from; people who are going to White Castle for the first time who are expecting something different. All I can tell these people is that, unless you've grown up with White Castle burgers, they are an acquired taste. They are the caviar of fast food burgers. You may not like White Castle burgers the first time you try them. But, after you eat them few times, you'll wake up at 3 a.m. some night and find yourself craving them. Those of us who grew up with them understand this. As I said, White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot.\n",
      "Oh I love you White Castle! The most amazing place. Only in Vegas can you get a 6 pack of burgers and beer! Sweet combo! I'll be back very soon!\n",
      "So you're drunk on the Strip and you want that delicious but poor food choice. Yep White Castle fits the bill. The sliders are little bites of heaven which do a great job coating your alcohol laden belly. Being originally from Detroit there was a White Castle on every corner so it wasn't an urgent run to try them when they arrived on the Strip. Being drunk and at Harrah's seeing the White Castle was like a beacon calling us over. The place was packed as we weren't the only ones with the same brilliant idea. The cashiers do a pretty efficient job filling all the orders as quick as possible so expect to wait 15 minutes on a busy weekend night. 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a pop (dammit I'm from Michigan and it's POP not soda) will set you back $8.99 but the extra space it soaks up for more alcohol consumption is priceless. Thank you White Castle!\n",
      "So I finally came to see what the hype was. I have had these before on the East Coast and knew what to expect. It was nothing to get excited about but these are pretty good sliders. The staff is amazing about getting everyone through the line and the food comes out quick. So mad props to the employees and their good service. I give it three stars because it just isn't a big deal. Be sure to order double what you think you can eat. Otherwise you'll be hungry. I enjoy it but not a frequent stop for me.\n",
      "Well, well, well-- another burger joint in Vegas. And guess what? It's affordable, especially after an intense session at the slots or tables! Or if you had ''too much fun'' at the clubs. Location: This burger hot spot is located near the Linq, across from Mirage-- it's literally next to \"Margaritaville'' or whatever. But definitely easy to spot (look for the castle structure sign). Interior: This is a typical fast food joint. Need I say more? Food: The burgers were pretty small. Being a Hefty Hannah that I am (inside and out), 5 burgers & fries would probably fill me up. I kid you not, I could probably fit 2-3 burgers in the palm of my hand. Compared to Shake Shack & In n Out -- this place is.... different. If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were \"eh.\" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of \"OMG, I ate 10 burgers!\" Service: It was alright. Nothing to complain about. TLDR: This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person). Turn Ons: - Cheap - Melted cheese - Super small KAWAIIIII burgers - Sauces - Opens 24/7 (I think...). Turn Offs: - Fries & Chicken rings (ew)\n",
      "I was very skeptical to try this spot because of all the bad comments I got from my friends before coming here. But I liked the ones that you buy from the freezer so that was enough for me to give it a shot anyway. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't great either. Surprisingly there's always a line specially past midnight. I'll have to be drunk to eat here.\n",
      "White Castle is Whites Castle. Always sounds like a good idea when you have had a few. And it's good at first. Then come regret and gastric distress. But that's what you do. But when it's super busy as this location, and it takes forever and it filled with people even drunk than you. Probably way drunken than you it's just not worth it.\n",
      "I'm a native new yorker and this couldn't be better I gave missed this, onion rings look different but it all remains me of home . thank you\n",
      "Went here on a busy Saturday night and there was ONE PERSON taking orders and over ten people on the assembly line - extremely poor management of man power. There were workers goofing off or just blankly staring off into space. I felt bad for the guy taking orders. Food wise: sliders were OK, nothing special and definitely over hyped by the movie Harold and Kumar.\n",
      "After years of eating the frozen burgers from the grocery store, I finally got to try them in person in a real location. I'll be honest, these are not the best burgers I've ever had - nor are they best sliders either. But hey, they're tasty and they get the job done. They're pricey but that's common in Vegas, but I must say the sliders with cheese are delicious. Their chicken rings, yes \"RINGS\" are delicious as well. So if you find yourself nearby while walking the strip and need either a small snack or full meal, try it. It's not the best burger in town, but it's a tasty for what it is.\n",
      "The Las Vegas restaurant is in a tight location. It's a small place in which the restrooms are located next door in the casino. Although they seem to have a sufficient number of tables. Orders are placed at the counter and your number is called when the order is ready for pick up. At the time of my visit the order line moved slowly because only 1 of 3 registers were open. The order was filled quickly even before I reached my table. Being from Chicago what can you say about White Castle other than \"It's an Institution\". But in Las Vegas it becomes another choice in the growing Burger business. Glad they are here because fresh is better than frozen and I won't have to satisfy the crave when visiting Chicago. Buy them by the sack. One difference here is that they do not have onion rings. They have onion chips. These are basically rings that have been cut into pieces. Just as good as the rings. Just place several on the slider.\n",
      "Ok if you are DRUNK, HUNGOVER, OR GONNA BE. These rock. If not they are kinda grease pits that sit in your gut. My friends had issues with the onions I did not.\n",
      "My bf is from the east coast and was beyond excited when news broke of a White Castle coming to Vegas. Being from California my heart belongs to in n out. That being said, their sliders are pretty good for the price. The sliders are on a soft pillowy bun with grilled onions and pickles with the option of cheese. We received a text 3 days before the official opening date stating that White Castle was giving away free food. Within minutes we were out the door and made the 20 minute drive to the strip. When we got there, there was caution tape preventing us to enter the restaurant from the casino, but we were able to see the entire restaurant. We saw kitchen staff making sliders and contractors making finishing touches. We figured that they would give away all the sliders they were practicing to make for the grand opening. After being told that they were only giving them to casino employees we decided to hang out for 45 minutes hoping for the chance they would have extra for us. We even offer to pay for them. The patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free! The customer service was amazing. Curious casino patrons would peek into the White Castle and sure enough an employee would come over to answer questions and encourage them to come back in a few days when they officially open. They open Tue, Jan. 27th at 2pm!\n",
      "We came Sunday 5/28/17 at 4:30 pm on our way home. The fries were the best part of the meal but let me tell you, nothing special about the burgers. We have had White Castle in New York and my husband was excited to try it here in Vegas. We BOTH left (my husband and I) with FOOD POISONING and we BOTH ended up in urgent care on Memorial Day and still too sick to return to work today! Right now is my second attempt to eat since eating there Sunday. I will NEVER eat there again! I have been burping up those nasty onions for two days! Ughhh! I will stick to the regular White Castle on the east coast. Lesson learned.....\n",
      "This was my first White Castle experience. I had tried the frozen ones before and didn't care for them and was assured by many that I had to try the real thing. I was excited that White Castle had opened in Vegas since it was more likely that I would make it to Vegas than the east coast. Final the Vegas trip was booked and I was excited to try out White Castle. Flash forward to Sunday morning. The breakfast debate begins and me and my home skillet decide on White Castle. Since its Vegas it's open 24/7 so why not! White Castle is located on the strip in the Casino Royale. The store front is located on the strip and easy to find. As you walk in it feels like any fast food restaurant. Ordering was quick, easy and friendly. We ordered the 2 person combo with 10 sliders (5 with cheese, 5 original), a fry, an onion chip and two soda's for a little over $20. Our order was up pretty quick. They do require you show your receipt when you pick up your order. I'm sure this is a safety measure as I can imagine as day turns to night and the party animals are on the loose there has been previous burger burglaries. The moment has arrived the tiny little boxes of meat onions and bread is before me! I take my first bite and.....it's alright. I figure it's a east coast thing. I'll stick to my my west coast In n' Out. The restaurant itself was good, I can't blame them for my taste buds being born and raised on the west coast. Moral of the story.....try it, you might like it, even if I didn't!\n",
      "Nahhh dude, you must be outta your mind because this was not worth the west coast adventure...\n",
      "They are what they are - greasy little piles of goodness. The pickle and cardboard box adds the missing pieces that the frozen ones can not provide. If you grew up with them then you know what I'm talking about. For first timers they probably won't be to your liking and that's fine too. Cut down on the fat by removing the bottom bun. It soaks up the majority of the fat.\n",
      "Terrible food. Chicken sandwich was just a piece of fried chicken between two buns. Absolutely nothing else on it. Double burger was better but still unsatisfying. Garbage\n",
      "Go to the Mcdonald's just a few minutes away if you want a cheeseburger. The sliders were pretty gross but the mozzarella sticks and fries were great. This place is overhyped for the taste and quality.\n",
      "Many years ago, I visited a White Castle back east (once) so I knew what to expect, but we decided to give this place a try just because it's new to Vegas. Before I get to the food, I have to mention that the two cashiers were both visibly annoyed at the customers in front of us, and they treated the couple two spots ahead of us in a completely unacceptable manner, simply because they were new to the menu and unsure how to order, making an annoyed face and screaming \"NEXT\" to get to the customer behind them. I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier? As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh. About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location. Not recommended.\n",
      "I first had the honor of noshing on these edible miracles, while attending the U or MN (Twin Cities), beginning in 1969 (Sliders were 12¢/each, then). I had a \"dry spell\" (living W of the Mississippi River) until I visited NYC in 1976. Since then, none. Now, it's like a prayer has been answered in my favor, and I can once again re-live my college days, even though I am now 65 and can't down the 20 I used to put away at a single visit in the 1970s. I have a friend in Meadview AZ who's more \"addicted\" to them than I am, so if he has HIS way, I'm sure he'll be traveling the 218 round-trip miles every weekend, and crying when that's not possible. While I'm glad they have finally opened an outlet in the Las Vegas Valley, I only have one question regarding that: WHY didn't you open one here, in the 1970s?\n",
      "Like everyone else, I was super excited to try this place after watching the movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\". Sad to say that I didn't enjoy the food very much. Ordered each item from the menu and the only good thing was the little chicken sandwich. Services was good and fast though.\n",
      "Nothing to go out of your way for. The sliders honestly sucked. Cool that it was open late but not worth the wait. Onion fries had really no onion\n",
      "This is not much of a burger. The meat, if you can find it is so small, you can't taste it. Although I pulled it out and tried just the meat. It was flavorless. The buns are wet. Not moist...WET. Even though you watch them cook the burger, it presents like a frozen, microwaved something you by in the frozen section at the supermarket. Fries? Yes, they have fries. Again it's like they microwave them. That's just how it is presented. The fries, crinkle cut, are barely cooked, soggy, and served Luke warm. I know this place is popular on the east coast, but from what I can tell, I am not sure why.\n",
      "I only expected better because we have these in St. Louis. It took them forever to get our order prepared and then it was wrong...so disappointing. once they got it right it was good. However, the wait was way too long and I wanted it right the first time.\n",
      "I'm not sure why the bad reviews. I mean it's not the best burger I ever had,but it is pretty tasty. Doesn't taste anything like the microwaved version of the chain. For what it is it does the job. It's a little pricey but I would eat it again next time I'm in town.\n",
      "I was in live for an hour last night when finally got to cashier to make my order I got 2 regular no onion and no cheese and 10 jalapeño no cheese- none where jalapeño and all cheese - all burgers ended up in the trash - 1 AM you know I was hungry ! Lost my appetite when saw wrong order -I try to call the vegas number and no way to be transfer to manager no one picks up. Left 5 messages no one bother to call back !! No excuse to take bad order !! Hire none experienced young kids to work ! Bad bad and bad !\n",
      "I finally made it to White Castle! Located on the busy strip of Las Vegas, the only White Castle on the West Coast(ish). This small shop is located next to the Harrah's on the east side of a small casino. As you may already know, parking on the strip (if you are coming from off the strip) is a pain in the butt, but if you are coming just to have White Castle I would choose a hotel/casino near the Harrah's. The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Once you walk in there are a few tables including one really long table with seats on both sides of the table. The counter is in the back of the restaurant. The menu is pretty basic; there are a few combos that include the sliders, fries and a drink, sliders that are being sold by themselves and also options to order large amounts of sliders! We ordered a regular combo, but added a few more sliders to our order. They came out quick and hot... and they tasted just like I imagined a fresh White Castle Slider would taste like... my childhood nostalgia. I easily packed away like 7 sliders without blinking, but boy do you pay for it later. I have friends that have visited the Midwest and told me that White Castle was delicious, but gives you gnarly gas... and boy does it! You have been warned.\n",
      "I grew up on the west coast, so White Castle is a relatively new phenomenon for me. I've been here at least 3 times, and I have to say that it tastes the best after a long night out. This is located in the Casino Royale casino, in between Venetian and Harrah's. This past time we went, we tried 1 of almost every slider available. Here's my personal ranking from best to worst: Double cheese slider Original slider w/ egg and cheese Cheese slider Fish slider and veggie slider Chicken ring slider and chicken breast slider I hope that makes sense. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken sliders. The fries are a must here, especially when they're freshly fried. Also, don't forget to ask for all your sauces at the counter when you pick up your food! The food usually comes out pretty quickly, so don't be discouraged by long lines!\n",
      "OK, let's calm down here, people. It's just White Castle. Is this really something to get excited about? If you happen to be in the area and you want to try it for the first time, be my guest. I would skip the fries if I were you. The onion chips are a much better bet. Sorry, vegetarians, but there are no veggie sliders to be had here. Rise up and be heard! (Tip: they're made by Dr. Praeger's and they're available in fine grocery stores everywhere.) No matter what you eat or don't eat, you probably have dozens of better options that you could walk to from here. \"The Crave Is A Powerful Thing\"? Well, then I guess it doesn't matter what I tell you. Bon appétit.\n",
      "I seriously don't understand the hype. I went on an adventure to just to get here, and I was fairly disappointed. The line wrapped around and almost reached the dining tables. The wait just to order took about 30 minutes, and the wait for the food was about an additional 20. I ordered a bunch of cheese sliders and original sliders to bring back to the hotel for my group of friends. Needless to say, my first White Castle slider will probably be my last White Castle slider. There was nothing special about it, and I definitely was not impressed. The patty was incredibly thin and I don't remember it tasting much like anything. I will consider trying the one on the east coast, but I will not be returning to this location.\n",
      "Am I gonna wait 45min for 4 mini burgers and fries after the club..? Hell ya! So I'm not from the Midwest and I didn't grow up on these, but I gotta say, these small hamburgers are damn good. Every time I come into Vegas I always get them after I've been out. The line can get long so be prepared to wait. These little patties are like basically sliders with thin meat and chopped up onions, catchup and mustard and a pickle. They are pan fried so they do retain a little more fat and grease which is why they taste so good. I do love their fries cuz they are extra crispy.\n",
      "If not for the movie, I would have never tried this. I regret it. White castle is straight disgusting. Its expensive for what it is too. Don't waste your time... McDonald's is head and shoulders better. Hell, so is Burger King and that's saying a lot!\n",
      "Ahhhh a familiar taste! This is the only location in Vegas! I am glad they have one from where I from (St Louis) they have them everywhere! I have read some of the reviews and I must laugh at some, this place is not a five star burger place, they are called \"Belly bombers\" for a reason! They a quick snack food and great late late at night or early am, or beating a rough night before. I LOVE white castles and will continue to go back they are great and I am glad to have them in town!!!\n",
      "Zimmerman's is my local grocery store, and while I try my best to avoid going there (for various reasons) somehow, I end up there a few times a week. The reasons why Freshmart is inferior to other grocery stores: - They never ever have sales on anything. No flyers, they don't accept coupons, they are getting the most money from you possible - Their selection sucks. I have been there many times that they've had no ground beef. COME ON! Ground beef?! Really they just don't have enough of anything! - Their deli service is questionable. One of the workers scares me a little! I haven't seen him around recently though, so maybe they figured out he scares the customers - The cashiers are touch and go. There are two (I think they owners) who are really abrupt and unfriendly. Then there are two younger people who are super friendly and personable. If you have a choice, go to a younger cashier! - Cleanliness - not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but this place never seems fully clean... So, if you have an opportunity to get a drive to Metro, do it. The sales there will also be better priced than Freshmart, which makes it worth the journey. If you have to go to Freshmart, just be prepared to pay through the nose for your every day needs. .. and you'll likely see me there.\n",
      "I think this might be the unhappiest place on earth. It never seems to have what I need, has bad prices and the staff seem miserable.\n",
      "I have been a loyal customer of Freshmart for the last few years. I just noticed that they have filled the void created by the closure of European Quality Meats and Sausages. Freshmart now carries their full line of products. The only difference their meat counter is self service. You don't have to take a number and wait. As to their prices they have without question the cheapest prices in the area.\n",
      "This is my local grocery store, and it is arguably the worst grocery store in Toronto. Why? - Understocked: Half the time I go in there, they don't have standard items like 2L 1% milk or cottage cheese. - Expired goods: When they do have what I want most of the time the expiry date is 1 week away. It's very rare I get what I want with a reasonable expiry date. - Highly overpriced: Everything from soda to toilet paper is way more expensive than even Metro or Loblaws. I used to be a huge opponent of Loblaws opening a store near Kensington, but with this being our only option, coupled with the fact that 90% of the stores in the market are only open until 7-8 (and even earlier in the winter), the people in this area sorely need a reasonable grocery store open. If you happen to be unemployed, Kensington would be a great place to shop. But for people who work until 5-6 and then have an activity after such as going to the gym, shopping in Kensington is an impossibility. It's extremely frustrating.\n",
      "Sketchy looking place at a first glance and it is indeed sketchy. I have had money stolen from a cashier (Kalsi, a middle-aged woman with brown skin and is roughly 5' 5\".) working at Zimmerman's twice in the past year. The first time, I let it slide. The second time, I contacted management (Martin Zimmerman) and he simply ignored me. Just so that others do not get scammed the same way I do, I will describe how I had money stolen. I gave her a $20 and after she put the bill in the cash register, she claimed I only gave her $10. When I insisted otherwise, she got hostile and accused me of trying to take money. What she will tell you is that the manager will count the money and if there is surplus, she will contact you. An obvious workaround for her is to pocket $10 before the manager counts. If you are paying with cash, I suggest you have the cashier identify the cash amount you are giving her. Have her verbally affirm that she sees the amount you are giving and better yet, record it with video.\n",
      "Closest thing to a typical grocery store in Kensington. Not too big but they'll have most things you'd need. They never really have sales, but the prices aren't TOO bad. Obviously you'll want to get your produce somewhere else in the market. Open until 7pm. Obligatory Title Pun: ZIMMER down! Menu Readability: Oh, so not applicable. Need to mention: Minimum order of $10 to use your CC or debit. What this place teaches me about myself: I moved to a part of town with absolutely no grocery stores.\n",
      "Major props to Zimmerman's for being open on Christmas, NYE and Thanksgiving! I stumbled into Zimmerman's one Christmas while searching for baking trays. I had gone to Chinatown in the hopes that something that would be open would sell baking trays, but sadly my hopes were mercilessly dashed. Zimmerman's being open taped up the broken pieces of my heart! It's a normal grocery store and seems adequately stocked. The prices could definitely be lower: I was happy to pay for the premium of being able to buy things on Christmas afternoon. You can't use debit unless you purchase $10 worth of goods, but that's understandable at an establishment of this size. The owner is a friendly guy and runs an A-OK grocery store.\n",
      "This store hasn't changed in years! It's still the depressing and overpriced store that I remembered from my earlier years, but I stopped in to take a browse since it has been a long time that I visited. No wonder it has been a long time! The interior is a decent size with spacious aisles and some-what stocked shelves, but selection of brands is limited. The way the shelves are setup so far apart, makes the store seems a little bigger, definitely lots of room in the aisles. Location is convenient if you live in the neighbourhood to get some staples in the market that other stores doesn't offer. If you don't have time to go to one of the bigger grocery stores and don't mind paying the higher prices for convenience, then this store is for you. I'm really surprised that Zimmerman's has survived. I wonder for how much longer?\n",
      "I am laughing so hard right now after reading the Edie review where she mentions the staff are \"disabled\", I, personally, hadn't noticed, but I'll look more carefully next time, maybe that cute blond that just started working there has a hidden peg leg.... I think not. The only thing I really buy here on a regular basis is milk. Most other things you would need such as toiletries and cleaning supplies you are much better off buying in bulk at a wallmart, if that notion doesn't offend you, and buying your meat and veggies at smaller stores in kensington market.\n",
      "Sadly, my wife and I attended last night's wine and art exhibit. We arrived to see a roped off area in the hallway outside the Art Exhibit. A small walkway had been left for those smart enough not to have ponied up the $30 plus per person to be served 3 very un-tasty wines. A red, a Brut, and a Chardonnay. We have had much better free wine tastings at Trader Joe's and a couple of liquor outlets here in town. On top of that, these free tastings also had cheese, crackers or nuts and chips to nosh on whilst you were sampling those free wines. Last time, Trader's offered 5 different wines, and the liquor store offered 4. The wine tasting started at 5 pm, and the exhibit did not open till 7pm? Well, there was a long period of wine sipping on an empty stomach before being herded into the exhibit hall and being allowed to crowd around 3 separate paintings. My wife in vertically challenged, and did not want to have to push her way through a crowd of wined up aficionados, to get a glimpse of the image as it was being talked about. We walked away with a bitter taste in our mouths from the bad wine and the old style vegas treatment of people like cattle. Wallace Eastman\n",
      "The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small and in any other big city, $15 for a well presented, but small Monet exhibition might not be worth the time or expense. Yet after walking up and down the Strip for a couple hours and repeatedly reminding myself of why I'm not a Las Vegas type of guy, this Gallery was a welcome and peaceful respite. With the audio guide in my ear, I enjoyed the overwrought explanations and wandered back and forth as I actually tried to learn something. It was an enjoyable time, and I was actually sorry that I had to go back and brave the happy hordes again.\n",
      "A touch of true (not manufactured) French impressionist art in Las Vegas. This city keeps on pleasantly surprising me. The Monet exhibition is on view through January 6, 2013. This exhibition showcased 20 works by Monet and eight other works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro, and Eugene Louis Boudin. February 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series. The gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works. Although I have to mention that the audio provided quite a lot of useless information rather than descriptions of the art work and the artists. Strangely enough, in addition to the gorgeous art, I was drawn to the walls of the studio that were painted a stunning purple! The cost of a ticket here is around $16 for adults ($13 for locals) and children under 12 are free. Pretty reasonable for a priceless experience. It's nice to partake in these creative gems without taking an international flight. If only this were a little bit bigger....think the Art Institute of Chicago maybe? We did Smith Center...now for a large museum (that's not mob related) Vegas!\n",
      "2 stars for the Andy Warhol exhibit's value in my eyes. $13 for locals, and it took us about 10-15min to walk through the entire place, taking a little time to check out each piece of art and reading the commentary. Can't say this was my style of art, but if it was a different artist or set, I could probably push the venue up to a 3-4 star review. But since it's not, I have to go with the value in my eyes, which was pretty low. I came here for the company anyways! LOL\n",
      "Bellagio prides itself on being one of the best luxury casinos on the Vegas strip thus I promptly expected it's art gallery to be up to par. I came to Vegas for the 4th of July weekend and noticed that they just recently opened a Picasso exhibit titled Creatures and Creativity. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to visit. However, it was far too crowded. I came back to Vegas about a month later when it was far less crowded and came by the gallery. I like to think of myself as a modern art aficionado; I am especially fond of Rothko and color blocking which is very different from Picasso's style. However, this exhibit boasted 43 works and regardless of whatever modern art movement you prefer this exhibit will not fail to impress. This collection contained a series of works inspired by his wife Jacqueline. The whole exhibit will give you a deeper appreciation of Braques and his cubist movement. I can't recommend this gallery enough. Go to it to take a break from all the slot machines and general chaos found in Vegas. Enjoy.\n",
      "We went here with some friends for the Picasso exhibit and it was great. They have an interactive headset feature where as you walk around you can hear a short story and description of each of the beautiful paintings as you are in front of them. The staff could be a bit more \"customer service\" oriented but I guess standing around all day staring at the same paintings does get to you after a while. It does provide a great history of his personal life and his inspirations for each of his works of art.\n",
      "I went to art school so of course, I love art. I've been to many museums such as SF MOMA, NY MOMA, LACMA, MOCA, Chicago Art Institute, Musee D' Orsay, Louvre and more. I've been to BGFA in Bellagio a few times when they had Gaugin, Picasso and the latest, Andy Warhol. We got there at 7:30pm and they were closing at 8pm. We were told we only had 30 minutes - yeah, I figured that much. I also knew we would only need less than 30 minutes. This is a teeny tiny gallery so even if I stared at every single piece of art and read the notes about each piece, I wouldn't need 30 minutes! For $13 per local, this place isn't worth it - you're not getting your money's worth at all. You can see more art in other galleries in other cities for $15. We were done in 15-20 minutes. They also don't allow photography. I've taken pictures of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre without a problem...yup, MONA LISA...LOUVRE! Something's not right. The gallery feels so stuffy and humid...might not be the best environment to keep art in. However, the lack of culture and art in this city, I feel obliged to like this gallery since I have no choice.\n",
      "It is sort of a failsauce art museum. However the Bellagio itself is an incredible work of art.\n",
      "I like the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts, enough that I renewed my annual membership today. I don't go as often as I should but I can and will--well not if history is my guide. I know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact. The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price. The current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art. The quality, however, is excellent. Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection. I didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition. Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists. Again, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery. With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA. It is worth having.\n",
      "Great exhibition of Monet's work. it's a little small, but then again it is an exhibition gallery and not a museum. It's fair priced and the atmosphere is great. The staff is very friendly and seem well educated on the matter. Lastly, a complementary audio guide is given to you as you access the Gallery providing some information and a little background of art on display.\n",
      "I love museums and I have been wanting to go to this gallery for quite awhile. I finally got the opportunity to go on Saturday and I was kind of disappointed at the quantity of art for the price, which is $12 for locals and $15 for tourists. There were pieces on display from artists such as Clemente (one of my favorites),Lichtenstein, Degas, Renoir, and a few from Picasso among others. In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls. In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork. I feel like this was the Bellagio's attempt to add to it's ambiance of refinement by adding this gallery which ended up just feeling like a cheap novelty of a museum. I'd rather go to the Guggenheim next time i'm in New York and get more bang for my buck. But hey, i'm a thrifty girl who usually pays $5 on suggested admission prices so take from that what you will :)\n",
      "Love art in all forms.. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art currently has 43 pieces from Pablo Picasso till January 10, 2016. I was expecting more than a Picasso collection but that pretty much it. Two rooms storing a number of his paintings for $19. Definitely not worth it. I could of seen this or researched his paintings online. A definite must skip. Enjoy the gelato place next door.\n",
      "Before I start the review, I wanted to address the biggest complaint I read here: The size of the gallery and the number of artworks here. This in itself raises an interesting question. What is the \"value\" and \"worth\" of admission of an art exhibit to a person? Do 3 paintings justify the price? 30 paintings? Do the artists showcased play a factor? Granted, I took advantage of a \"Free Admission\" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars. It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the \"Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form\" exhibit. Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir. Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something. And it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year. The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room; an issue that I had at another (now closed) museum here. There are locals and student discounts. It comes with a free audio tour. So what is the price of viewing art worth to you? If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself? I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here. When the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back. And yes, I'd actually be fine in paying to do so.\n",
      "Las Vegas is not known for it's museums and other artistic endeavors. This is one of the few places where you can come to see really great art. I've been coming to this gallery for many years before I lived here. It was one of the few things I actually wanted to come to the Strip and do when I came to visit my sister who has lived here for 20 years. The Art - They try to do at least two shows a year. I've seen some great art while out here. Don't think you are coming to the Met or something. This is a small small small gallery, but you see some great works. Right now is a Warhol exhibit, which I found pretty interesting. Some have bashed the pieces shown, but I've seen several Warhol exhibits so it's nice to see a different side. I just love art, though, so I'm usually always happy to see anything. Cost - Tickets are $16 but what can you expect in Las Vegas? For locals you can get half price on Wednesday nights. I went ahead and bought a membership, which allows me to go as much as I want with a guest. I'll put it to good use too. I suppose I could give a four star but really it's just kinda ok. If you are use to bigger museums then you may be disappointed. I was also disappointed that they turned the gift shop into a store to buy over priced prints. I really like being able to buy something small to remind me of an exhibit that I've seen. Oh well, another reason why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars. If you love art then I'd say go. If you are only ok with art, maybe go ride a roller coaster or something along those lines. You might be disappointed.\n",
      "I have visited this museum 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years. Fortunately, my husband can occasionally get us in for free so that's when we go. Like this past weekend, for example. The current exhibit, which runs through January 2012, is \"A Sense of Place.\" But the sense I got was that they just threw some paintings together to try to fit a theme. I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up. It starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up. The last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a \"Sense of Place\" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot. I really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head. A few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars. But for now I will say, don't bother (unless you are seriously in love with art)... and let's wait til January to see what the next exhibit will be.\n",
      "Very disappointed! I was expecting more for the price. The museum is EXTREMELY small for the $20 ticket per person. It is only two rooms. Very, very small. Very disappointed. If you are not interested in the artist, then don't bother coming. They change themes every 6 months or so; just like other museums, but this one is extremely small. Not much variety... I mean, there is no room for variety I guess.\n",
      "Wanted to see the Farbege exhibit. Student and resident discount Smaller than most exhibit I've been to but it's always fun to see history. A bit of a walk from lobby but the hotel is beautifully done.\n",
      "I'm a bonafide art lover who lives in the art wasteland that is Las Vegas, so I'm super happy and grateful that the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art exists in our town. I support it every chance I get and I never miss an exhibition. The exhibitions change only a couple of times per year so make sure you call to find out what's currently on display. I love that a free audio tour is included with your admission. Make sure you pick it up because it's very informative. The gallery itself is super tiny. Even if you are expecting the small size, you'll still be disappointed. The exhibits only have a few pieces on display but it's better than nothing. The curator here is big on having a certain theme or artist on display for each exhibition. We've had Monet, Warhol and more general themes like Women Painters. Allow 30 minutes to an hour to view the exhibit. You won't need more time than that. The museum offers a local's discount certain days of the month. It changes so call ahead, but tickets are reduced in price from $13 to $8. The gallery has monthly wine discussions in the gallery too where you enjoy wine pairings and talk about the art for around $40 per ticket. Photography is NOT allowed in the gallery.\n",
      "The Gallery is a nice alternative to the stereotypical Vegas activities. I was here for the Warhol exhibit. For the size of the of the exhibit and the cost, I wouldn't recommend it unless you love the artist. General Admission, out of state , is $16. This is high considering you can go to MoMA in NYC for $25 or the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburg for $20 and see his work as well. You could walk through the show in 5 minutes if you didn't read the picture placards or listen to to hand held audio device that was included with admission.\n",
      "My husband and I went to see the Warhol Out West exhibit, as I am a big fan of Andy Warhol. While it is a small gallery, and a bit pricey for the size, I loved the pieces chosen to be part of this collection. They had his famous Campbell's soup cans, self-portraits, American Indians, snapshots, moving installations, and a few diamond dust pieces -- all-encompassing of this amazing artist's different works. I loved all 45 minutes of my audio tour as well. I recommend it to those who appreciate and love Andy Warhol and would enjoy a refreshing activity outside from typical Vegas madness.\n",
      "I have been there. I believe more than once. I was not in awe by this gallery. It was Ok. I thought it would be bigger and have more art, and flair. I guess not. I am glad it exists, I guess its good to have a touch of historical fine art in a casino, since the city of Las Vegas has very few fine art museums.\n",
      "Whether or not this is worth the price of admission depends a lot on the current exhibit and how big a fan you are of that art. When I visited, they were displaying works (mostly) by Monet which were loaned by the Boston Museum of Art. This is actually the second time I've seen this exhibit in Vegas, although they had different paintings each time. The first time, about 7 years ago, was the first time I had seen Monet's paintings in person and I was blown away. This time, although I've now seen his works in Seattle and in Paris, I was still pretty happy with the exhibit. The only disappointment was that they didn't have any of my favorite pieces. The space is large enough to feel like you aren't caught in a crowd, small enough that you can see everything in a reasonable amount of time, and the audio guide worked well. If you're up for a little culture with your vacation of sin, and the gallery is showing something you're interested in, it's definitely worth stopping by!\n",
      "Families are not welcome in this gallery - strollers are not permitted and they will not store them for you. Not worth the money, and if you read their website they don't even guarantee to be open during their publicized hours. Don't even bother going here!\n",
      "As a huge Warhol fan, I was pleasantly surprised at what this exhibit had to offer. Small but a well rounded display of all that is Andy Warhol. The polaroids being my favorite part. I also appreciated the free phone gadgets that explained in detail the background of each piece. Being an Art major and from an area that offers maybe a little too much culture (Washington, D.C.).. Little gems like this make me so happy. I missed the Monet exhibit but will be back for future displays. Oh, and the local discount was cool, too! If only they served wine and/or champagne. Didn't they get the memo that wine and art are a killer combo? :) **Please note: Absolutely NO photography is allowed. Andy Warhol never allowed photography even if it was taken without a flash. So BGFA respectively made sure to follow his wishes.\n",
      "Small but fabulous gallery. Favorites include Eugene Louis Boudin's \" Venice, Santa Maria della Salute from San Giorgio\" and David Hockney's \"Garrowby Hill\". A must-see if you're on the Strip!\n",
      "Went to the Warhol exhibit. Save your money and buy the coffee table book. For the price they are charging you should be able to get in to a real museum.\n",
      "First it should be said that this is an art gallery in a casino. While it may seem an odd note to begin with, it seems that many people have a few overblown expectations about it. With that out of the way, the gallery itself is a small, four-room affair, with a very silent feel to it. The exhibits are arranged in number order to correspond with the free audio tour wand, which has an explanation of a few of the things to look for at the piece. The gallery changes themes about twice a year, and is actually quite well-curated. Rather than being a giant art gallery, it has more of the feel of a small artist's gallery, and is themed as such. The only thing holding me back from a 5-star review is the price. It is simply too expensive for many people out there, and a lot of them will feel cheated for the money. At a stout $15 per person, it can seem a bit pricey, especially with places like the Met at NYC can be entered for a mere $5. I think that this gallery is to be relegated to being a locals gallery, since they can get a discount (even more for students), and it is one of a very small set of galleries in the Las Vegas area. This being a casino, each part must make money, and I guess the only way that the BGFA can do so is through exorbitant prices.\n",
      "Always consistent. I've been here several times for different exhibitions. Intimate, quaint and a nice alternative in Vegas.\n",
      "Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.\n",
      "OK, so when I was there they had Monets. i think that earns a three star rating all by itself. They did have a couple significant pieces, but in general i found the gallery a little lacking. I can't say why, I was just expecting a different level than I experienced. Everything aside it was an opportunity to be up-close with over a dozen Monets so I would probably have to do it again.\n",
      "This gallery is beautiful! As an art history major finding this hidden gem was just amazing. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Balagio. I was lucky to be in town for the Picasso installation, and we're talking before Picasso got into cubism Picasso, which I personally believe to be the best from him. They had beautiful pencil portraits of his and I just couldn't believe how remarkable they were. Such excellent quality. I also enjoyed that even though this gallery is small, there isn't a lot of people in it all at once so you can take your time with all the art and people won't stand in your way to see them.\n",
      "I am not the standard Vegas traveler. I don't ride a scooter holding a cigarette and oxygen tank. I don't wear an upside-down over-sized visor while clutching a yard-long margarita. I don't go to clubs in my shiny shirt. And I don't get my perv on at the topless pools. I have absolutely nothing against those activities, nor those who seek to participate in them. Honestly, I don't. People are free to seek out whatever kinds of carrying-on makes their trip an enjoyable one and there seems to be something of an agreement that those I previously described can be seen as among the most popular, they're just not my idea of a good time. No, when I'm in Vegas I'm there to eat. I do a little gambling. A little shopping, maybe. But the focus of my three-or-four-times-a-year sojourns in Sin City are focused on great food and wine. Las Vegas has positioned itself as a destination for the gustatorily inclined, amongst which I count myself and my small group of friends. So there you have it. But what to do in-between meals? What indeed? It's a puzzle, isn't it? Thank goodness, then, for the Bellagio Gallery of Fine art. And while not incredibly well curated, it does at least have interesting pieces on display whenever I visit. They usually let an exhibit run for 4-6 months or so, and though it's never anything TRULY exciting, it does at least offer a welcome oasis of high-culture in a desert of debasement. You'll never see anything as outside the mainstream as a Jason Rhoades installation there. I don't think any Richard Prince retrospectives are in danger of being hung, but I did see some nice O'Keefes, Marsden Hartleys, and an Ashille Gorky on my last visit. There have been Picassos, Cezannes, and Monets in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that. The space is a little cramped, which gets in the way of appreciating pieces at varying distances, and the flow of the space is a little odd, and maybe the paintings are grouped a little tightly sometimes... but I'm willing to forgive these little transgressions as grateful as I am to have something besides an 80-foot high mural of a showgirl's ass to gaze at while I'm waiting for mealtime to roll around. Not that... well... you get the idea. As long as you manage your expectations, the 17 bucks you will drop for admission is pretty good compared to what that same amount will buy you out on the casino floor. Go on, get some culture! It's good for ya! There will be plenty of time for scooters and 'ritas and showgirl-ass later in the day. Trust me, there always is.\n",
      "Totally worth it if you love art and need a bit of culture in your Vegas trip. The exhibit area is not large, so don't be expecting a big museum. We saw the Painting Women exhibit and it was very nice, lots of great paintings and some artists I had never seen before but will be looking into when I get home. I think it was about $20 a person, expensive but not for Las Vegas--everything's expensive here!\n",
      "My husband and I were not big fans of this gallery. We both walked out and said, \"That was it?\" We were expecting a lot more. We went there with high hopes for the American Modernism exhibit. Actually, we were really looking forward to it. See, my husband is an art professor at The University of Texas, so art is a big part of our lives, and we were really looking forward to the artists they advertised as included. The price was super expensive to enter. I paid less when I went to the Prado. This was no Prado, believe me. It consisted of two rooms and one video room where they were showing a relatively cool video on Georgia O'Keeffe. But other than that, I'd skip it. I felt like we paid $17 to watch a 20 minute video.\n",
      "I went to see the Warhol exhibit, they had a limited amount of pieces. I'm not sure if they were real or reproductions. Which puzzled me. I kept looking close and the numbers next to the name said 2 of 32, so I'm guessing they were special limited repos. I'm not an art expert or anything I just wanted to see Warhol's work in person.\n",
      "I apparently am not enough of an art lover to appreciate the enigmatic sparseness of this one room display on the human form....translation: ummm..where is the rest of the art in this place?Gift shop is as big as the gallery. It is a nice reprieve from the Blackjack table. So for that they get two.\n",
      "I was interested in coming here because they were exhibiting works by Picasso. I think Picasso's work is pretty cool. This a headset guided tour. I guess you can just walk around if you want, but I highly suggest experiencing this in they way they've set it up. There was plenty of information given in Picasso's artistic processes as well as details on his love and personal life. Be aware that there are no photos allowed to be taken. If you are an artist you will gain new knowledge on different techniques and I'm sure become inspired. For the art lover like me, you too will be pleased. I should note that this was an extremely short art exhibit so you may not be so happy with that. For $19.00 and being held inside the Bellagio I guess this was reasonably priced. At a larger museum this probably would have been an exhibit add on for around $10.00. Me and my husband got in for free using My Vegas points so you can try that too.\n",
      "I had gone to the Monet gallery and wanted to return when they got a new artist in, although it is small and doesn't take long to go through, I found it interesting and decently priced. When I had heard that Andy Warhol art was coming into the space I was excited to go check it out. I enjoyed seeing both galleries, but I would say I spent more time in Monet. It held my attention a little better and was all around just more interesting to me. I think everyone is different and some people might think vise versa of my opinion and I can see that, but I would definitely recommend going to check out the gallery no matter what art is being displayed. Its a great locals night out (dinner, gallery, drinks) and something nice for tourists to do too, to get away from all the gambling, smoking, and drinking (even if it is only for an hour or so). Hours: 10a-8p Prices: GA $16 Local $13\n",
      "The Picasso exhibit was a nice distraction from the Vegas craziness. We went early afternoon on a Thursday and there wasn't much of a crowd inside. We were able to enjoy the exhibit without feeling rushed and the audio guide helped a lot. The exhibit seemed a lot smaller than the advertised amount, only because some of the paintings were part of a series and it showed the same piece develop over time. They offered a discount for M life members and at $16, it was was a great break from the craps table.\n",
      "Went to see the Warhol Exhibit this weekend and I can't believe it was $16 for 15 minutes (or less) of Andy art. They give you a telephone remote thing so you can get more information on each piece if you like. The exhibit was super small. Only did it so I can say I've seen his original work but unless you're a crazy Warhol fan I'd say save your money.\n",
      "***************************** 1363 *************************** Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small gallery located right across the Bellagio Pool. $18 ticket but if you are M Life Platinum/Noir member like me, you got 2 free tickets :-) This time it was the Pablo Picasso private collection from his son. Picasso: Creatures and Creativity - On display July 3, 2015 - January 10, 2016. The exhibition features over 45 of Picasso's paintings, linocuts and lithographs spanning the 1930s - 1970s. These works showcase Picasso's extraordinary ability to capture the human form with his use of line, movement and color. Highlighting his ability to create portraits that vary from realism to the highly abstract, the exhibition reveals Picasso's evolution as an artist over a 40-year span. It was quite amazing to see the different from one to another right next to each other. A few things you are not allowed to do here, unlike other museum where you are allowed to take photos with no flash, not here. - Strollers are not permitted in the Gallery. - Food, drinks, videotaping and photography of any kind are not permitted in the Gallery. - Use of cellular devices is prohibited.\n",
      "Not worth the 15$ admission. I've been to galleries around the world and have a minor in art history and the Lichtenstien Warhol and friends show was the smallest collection of minor works I've ever been charged for. We were very disappointed.\n",
      "We spent about an hour walking through here to see Picasso's paintings, lithographs, and linocuts. It's a small exhibit, which really encourages you to just walk through and listen to each clip of the audio tour (which I typically never do in larger installations). I didn't know much about Picasso aside from his more popular paintings, so to learn about his lithographs/linocuts, was really intriguing. A linocut is like a giant stamp. Picasso would create entire series off of one linocut, which he would stamp once, then cut into and stamp again. Repeat. In one way, it's a bit heart-breaking to know that he just had the one linocut, vs having dozens of them to show the series..but that's kind of what makes it really beautiful.\n",
      "It's nice to see some genuine culture amidst the tacky bling of most of the trip. I saw an exhibit titled \"Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form\". The cost was $12 for locals and included an informative audio tour. It led you through 4 rooms filled with paintings, sketches, mixed media and photographs, including pieces by Picasso and Renior as well as more modern artists. True, the museum is modest, but I thoroughly enjoyed this display.\n",
      "I'm not an expert on fine art, but I can appreciate something beautiful, something that has survived for centuries, and anything with historical significance. So anytime there is an art gallery nearby, no matter what the exhibit, I do enjoy stopping in to take a look. My husband and I were passing some time on our last day in Vegas while waiting to leave for the airport. Figured the art gallery would be a nice, relaxing way to spend an hour or so. Entrance fee ($17) was relatively inexpensive, surprisingly, seeing that everything else we'd done in Vegas up to that point had been rather pricey. I can't remember the name of the exhibit we'd seen - it wasn't anything too famous like Andy Warhol (earlier this year) or Faberge (coming soon). But the paintings were mostly early 1900s it seemed. We were also given little handheld audio devices where we could listen to more information regarding maybe 20 of the paintings. The only issue I had with the gallery was that it was rather small. Maybe 3 or 4 rooms. We definitely went through it in well under an hour, and when we got out we were like, That's it?! Not that a gallery can't be small; it's just not what we were expecting. Art galleries are my go-to thing to do when I run out of other things to do. I would definitely go back again if there was an exhibit that sounded interesting.\n",
      "I really love this bit of culture driven by the finest absolutely priceless art hidden in the back of the Bellagio. Most never make the trek down the long hallways to get there. But, if you appreciate some of the world's finest art, along with an incredible adjective and adverb filled audio guide pulled from the largest thesaurus available, I'd really advise coming here. Once, we were lucky enough to take in an Andy Warhol exhibit. It was incredible! Pop art didn't exist before Andy's era. Wow! Another time, we saw a Alexander Calder exhibit. Did you know he invented the mobile? In other words, before Alexander Calder, nobody on the planet had conceived of creating hanging sculptures that move in the slightest breeze! These kinetic art forms now grace toddlers cribs, enormous atriums, airports, and wonderful spaces the world over! They even had his one true transitional work, where the mobile was hanging within a traditional picture frame. He then broke from the confines of a frame and centuries of art history and moved his art in to the open where it could rotate, move and be seen from all angles. Truly inspiring!\n",
      "The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art may not be comparable to galleries found in major metropolitan cities, but it's a much appreciated gallery that Las Vegas is fortunate to have. It offers visitors the opportunity to view artwork by renowned artists. Finding the gallery can be an adventure. Being a local who's somewhat familiar with the layout of the Bellagio, I've never seen the gallery before and had to ask for assistance on its whereabouts. The gallery is tucked in another wing in the Bellagio, away from the boisterous sounds and excitement of the casino. If you know/can find Cafe Gelato, it's within close proximity. Here's a rundown of the current ticket prices: General Admission: $16 *Nevada Resident: $13 Students, Teachers, and Military: $11 (High School student IDs only) Children 12 and under: Free *Nevada Resident prices are $8 on Wednesdays only from 5:00pm - 7:30pm. I came here on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $8 Nevada Resident price, which I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have paid the full amount to see an exhibit. Like some reviewers have mentioned, the gallery is very small, and you'll be in and out within an hour at max. There's a free guided tour device that makes me feel like I'm Zack Morris talking into a brick phone. It's complimentary, and I'd suggest grabbing one because the plaques don't have much details about the art. For art lovers, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art might be a good place to visit, but for someone who's only mildly interested, I might just skip it all together and view the art online instead.\n",
      "Just saw the Faberge' exhibit. The art and stories were fascinating. The exhibit hall is beautiful and the staff friendly. The docent was very knowledgeable. We were excited to see this because our daughter is leaving for Moscow for 16 months. The price is reasonable for locals and students.\n",
      "Skip this. I visited Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts while they were having the Mohammed Ali collection. 1. I was scammed out of an extra ticket cost. I have a Buy One Get One Free pass, but was charged me for two tickets anyways. Upon bringing this up, she wrote \"Returned 1\" on my receipt and said I'll be refunded. I had to call them later to get the refund. 2. The cost of entrance is $16 for hotel guests or AAA members. $18 otherwise 3. Use myVegas app 4000 credits to get a buy one get one free 4. The art gallery is 2 big rooms and even if you spend time looking and reading everything, you should be out in roughly 40 minutes. 5. When I went, they had a Mohammed Ali collection. Autographed items and replicas of things he used. It's cool, but it's not fine art. Maybe I'm just the type of guy that doesn't appreciate art, but it was NOT worth $18. Even at half the price, $9 is not worth it.\n",
      "The Faberge Revealed exhibit at the Bellagio Fine Art Gallery is not to be missed if you enjoy exquisite craftsmanship. The exhibit showcases over 200 artifacts from Karl Faberge and other jewelers from Russia. This traveling exhibit on loan from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is amazing and will be in Las Vegas until May, 2015. The exhibit features four Imperial Easter eggs. The eggs demonstrate the intricacy of the exceptional design and artistry. Also included are Faux, Faberge look alike objects that have been available over the years.\n",
      "This gallery was small and expensive. Sure, the quality of the collection was top notch, it is after all, in the Bellagio. If they lowered the price to $10, it would be a little bit more reasonable. My main gripe is that they won't let you take photos of the art work. not even without flash. The paintings were made before copyright laws, so I don't know what the big deal was. I doubt I'll come back unless if I could get in somehow with a discount.\n",
      "A nice place to take a breather from the fun and frivolity of Vegas. I've been here twice --- once for an exhibit of impressionists when the place first opened, then again for an Andy Warhol showing. It's a lovely little museum. In fact, it was Julia Roberts' workplace in the movie, \"Ocean's 11.\" The admission is reasonable. The place has a gift shop offering a lot of cool ways to introduce your kids to fine art. Definitely worth a visit. Find out more at: http://www.bellagio.com/amenities/gallery-of-fine-art.aspx\n",
      "We saw a very good show on the architecture and design of City Center. The docents were very helpful. One offered to get me a pencil and paper to take notes. The audio guide could be more informative, but it was fairly decent. The gallery is a good deal if you are a Nevada resident. They offer a special locals night on Wednesdays for $8 per person. It is a bit small, but consider that a plus if you wish to get in depth with the exhibits.\n",
      "This was my first visit to the Bellagio Fine art gallery. I heard they were showing some of Pablo Picasso's work. I was excited because I was looking for inspiration for my personal fine art photography projects. It cost $16 for locals and they offered free audio headphones (I declined the headphones). It took me all of 10 minutes to walk through the gallery! I felt very disappointed and cheated with the small amount of work they had on display. Even the Cosmopolitan hotel had more art to see inside of their hotel... And it was FREE! Not that money is a factor, but for $16 there were too many empty wall space in the gallery. It was still pretty cool to see a few of Picasso's paintings. Not many can say that... But I doubt I'd go back.\n",
      "$15 general admission to a small gallery. Select few good pieces but not really worth the price.\n",
      "On 9/20/17 we experienced the Bellagio Art Exhibit of Muhammad Ali. The public cost was $18 per adult and children 12 and under were free. We used the Las Vegas Power Pass, so this attraction was included. The exhibit included 2 smaller rooms displaying some pictures and stories about Ali. You can also receive a device which tells you stories while you progress through the exhibit. In addition to the pictures, there were a few displays containing artifacts of Ali. Most of which were reproductions. It took about 15 minutes to go through the exhibit, but we stopped listening to the recordings pretty quickly and just read the information and looked at the artifacts. Unless you are a die hard Ali fan who wpuld like to see reproductions and have some cash you want to waste, I would recommend skipping this exhibit and look at the photos I provided, they pretty much show what you would see. However, if your in the area and have the Power Pass or received free admission, then go for it.\n",
      "Last month I went to see the Claude Monet's Impression of Light exhibit. And I was so delighted to be there. The gallery is small and compact but right to the point. It was a very intimate experience. The audio tour was also very nicely done, not too much information but just enough for you to get a good understanding of the painting. I can't wait to see what the gallery has to offer next time I come back to Vegas\n",
      "Everyone knows that when it comes to all things Las Vegas, it ain't cheap. I can't find a single better example than the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. Yes, it might be fine, but there's no reason to pay a hefty fine to see some 25 or 30 pieces of art. It costs $15 for non locals and $10 for students. Yes, they do have works from Picasso and that fact alone saved this review from being demoted to a single star. Save your money and go to the Richard MacDonald gallery of art based on his sculptures of Cirque du Soliel. Ironically, there are more works here and they are insanely detailed and quite amazing. Oh, and this gallery is also free.\n",
      "I came in with a friend to check out the \"Warhol Out West\" tour. I'm not a huge Warhol enthusiast, but I really enjoy several artists that were inspired by his work. So we figured we would come and check out the original. Let me first say that the Bellagio cannot really control what the Warhol people choose to display. So I won't hold this against them. But I will say that the pieces chosen were odd. None of them said a whole lot about the artist. And that gets me to the other failing, there wasn't much to look at. There were three small rooms with relatively bare walls. At first I thought the ticket prices were decent, two of us got in for 24 dollars. However, after getting through the exhibit in just over fifteen minutes, I couldn't help but feel let down. More than ten dollars for a few minutes of glances, and nothing jumped out as inspiring or monumental. The audio tour included was dull, and rambled on a lot about things that weren't too important. And there were also an absorbant amount of security in the place, lingering over our shoulders the whole time wondering if we were taking pictures or not. I get that important art must be protected, but so many guards ruined the immersive experience one is supposed to have while at a gallery. With such an alluring figure as Warhol, I went in expecting to be entertained. I wasn't concerned about the ticket price. But after leaving feeling more than unfulfilled, I had to wonder if maybe it all should have been a bit cheaper. All this said, I'm glad the Bellagio is displaying art. And I welcome other exhibits, hopefully on the more interesting side.\n",
      "We came to see the Picasso exhibit. There weren't many works but it was beautiful, I highly recommend to get the audio tour (it's free). The gallery is not kid friendly nor stroller friendly. It's small and I don't think there was proper security. We got tickets from the MGM hotel special \"3 attractions for $57.\"\n",
      "Skip this. They just have two rooms worth of exhibits. About the size of two living rooms. So when you pay about $18, you would think they would put at least the best art in these two room, but not so at the BGFA. For example, I came here for the Picasso Creatures and Creativity. They had way better art at the Picasso Restaurant then at the BGFA. At least I had a fine dinner and got to experience several paintings rather than random sketches at the BGFA. No matter how much I tried to stay as long as I could to get my monies worth, I spent only about 15 minutes at the BGFA. And that was a stretch.\n",
      "As someone who has worked with many museums, I was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go! Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small. That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you: * pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much. * it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them. * the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.\n",
      "The largest collection of Monet art on display outside of Paris!!!! (at Bellagio through January 6, 2013) We just happened to stumble upon a poster advertising this Monet exhibit. How lucky was I since Claude Monet has been my favorite painter ever since I was first introduced to his work in 2nd grade!!! You bet I was freakin excited! (Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces). The gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display. We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that. I was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot). They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see. Some of my favorites from the gallery were: Grainstack (sunset) Meadow with Haystacks near Giverny Meadow with Poplars Antibes Seen from the Plateau Notre-Dame Charing Cross Bridge (overcast day) Entrance to the Village of Vetheuil in Winter There are a couple of security guards, as one would expect. But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum. A superb exhibit -- if you are you a Monet fan, you mustn't miss this! The orchid-colored gallery walls really set the mood and complemented the art. THANK YOU, BELLAGIO!! =)\n",
      "One of the few places in town you can view work from renowned artists and this place charges like its the Met. Maybe that's a bit much. But then again so is $19 for a two room exhibition no bigger than your local Starbucks. That's like paying $50 to go to Coachella to see ONE band play ONE song. It's bullshit, right? It is not worth the admission for most of the exhibitions they show. If you're a local, $10 on Wednesdays is a bit more reasonable... but discounts are only 5-8pm which doesn't really make much sense.\n",
      "Don't waste your money. They hype it up to be something large and worth seeing but it's not. The exhibits were small and not worth the high admission fee. I even used my student discount and still thought it wasn't worth it.\n",
      "I saw the monet exhibit. FACTS: Conveniently located center strip in the Bellagio. The Gallery has two rooms. One room had a class of 10 yrs old kids complete w/ an excitable teacher talking sht about art while waving hands and saying stuff like \"Look at those brush stokes!!! I want each of you to think of three questions about those brush strokes!!!!? \"Yo man, I just made some mad MONET up in that blackjack table\" is not real slang. The brush strokes are actually quite impressive. So are the dots. The audio tour is worth it. The music playing over the narration is ostentatious. Steve Wynn dyes his hair/whitens his teeth, and visits tanning salons. He also appears to favor \"luxury style\" decorating. Which is boring. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Steve_Wynn_Portrait.jpg I liked the exhibit and was glad to have it. Good use of purple. I wonder what kind of landscapes monet would paint if steve wynn sent him to vegas. Fatasses on electric-mobility-scooter/wheelchairs is my guess. They're everywhere. Quite the contrast visa v sienne blending into the sky with young woman in purple.\n",
      "very nice! We saw a very well put together exhibit with very famous and not as famous art. well worth it!!! There were families there but parents were carefully & respectfully educating the children on the att.\n",
      "The Bellagio's Gallery of Fine Arts is one of those visits that you need to make whether if you're local or a visitor. Reading the reviews on Yelp is very helpful before visiting BGFA. And if you're reading this now, you passed step one. BGFA looks like a fairly sized exhibit on the outside, but don't let that fool you. A couple of steps inside and you're wowed with the fact that BGFA is small. This was my thoughts the first time I've ever visited BGFA. Prices for the exhibit is about $15 (current exhibit is $16). There's local nights which is half price, which is big deal. Once you're in you're given an audio hand-held and can tour BGFA at your own pace. I've been here for the Monet Exhibit, which I thought was fantastic. I loved it and even paid the full price because I forgot locals get discounts. My most recent visit was Andy Warhol's exhibit and this time got in during Local's night. Regarding the Andy Warhol exhibit itself, it's really not for everyone. You have to be a fan of Warhol to love this exhibit. And even if you're a huge fan, you need to keep in mind that only a select pieces of his artwork is displayed here. In other words, your favorite pieces may or may not be on display. I once dated someone that was a huge fan so you can say I was forced to love some of his work. PS: When you exit, don't forget to stop by Jeff Mitchum's Gallery. His work is on display or you can review his books that showcase his art. Some comfortable seating too.\n",
      "I went here to view the Andy Warhol exhibit. The exhibit was short, just a few rooms. They had some of the most phenomenal pieces. There were styles that I had never seen before, and the explanation was quite detailed. I would simply not go here expecting an exhibit of the Art Institute of Chicago proportions. You may feel like you overpaid a bit, but you're in Vegas so the gauging shouldn't be a complete surprise.\n",
      "It's a small museum, but every time I've been here I've been impressed by how well organized the exhibit is. It is worth the money. As others have said, this is not an all day experience. But if you want to get some culture to balance out the debauchery of vegas, this is the place to do it.\n",
      "Warhol was unconventional, his art was pop, accessible over the top, warm, happy .... The Bellagio exhibit is cold, sterile, lofty... the exact opposite of Andy's philosophies. I think he would vomit. A major disappointment. Warhol's art is amazing and powerful... but the Bellagio exhibit is disjointed and odd. We just returned from the Andy Wahol: 'Warhol Out West' exhibition to open at Bellagio.\n",
      "(I have only been to one exhibit here, so until I see how other exhibits fare, 3 stars. Also, this is a piece I wrote for a magazine that never published it.) \"People either love Andy Warhol, or they hate him\" quipped Warhol Out West exhibit tour guide, Gina, \"And I think he loved that people felt that way about him.\" It's easy to see why people feel so strongly. In today's world of Instagram filters and Photoshop, people may look at his work and say, \"I can do that!\" or \"that's not art!\" But don't let the simple or mundane of Warhol's style fool you. He spoke about society through his work in a very tongue-in-cheek way. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art's showing of Warhol Out West, is currently displaying 59 pieces of his work on loan from The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Andy Warhol. From the famous soup cans, to screen tests, balloons to ballroom dancing instructions, the exhibit has a little bit of everything from Warhol's work. Also included in the collection are less famous works, such as his Polaroid pictures of celebrities, which have influenced the likes of celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, or Warhol's rendition of American Master Charles Schreyvogel's \"Breaking through the Line.\" Portraits of Geronimo, Annie Oakley and General Custer, along with others from the \"Cowboys and Indians\" collection, are on display. It is in this collection that Warhol's critique of society shines through. When the docent turned to the small crowd gathered around her, she asked \"So what do you think of Warhol's work?\" Two people on the tour had competing ideas about it. \"I just love how he could see beauty and form in the everyday piece and elevate it to high art\" and another observer, \"We're standing in a five-star resort, and paid money to look at balloons and soup cans. This was clearly one big joke to him and one big eff you to pretentious people in the art world. He turned his joke into a money-making deal for himself. Good for him.\" For those unfamiliar with Warhol's work, this exhibit is the perfect chance for you to pick a side - was Warhol serious about his art, or was he making a buck while simultaneously saying through his work, \"don't hate the artist; hate the art game?\" You decide. Audio tours are available all day and docent led tours, which are highly suggested, are offered every day at 2 p.m. Tours are free with admission. $16 general admission, $13 for Nevada residents, $11 for students with ID.\n",
      "We generally visit this gallery while in Las Vegas and this trip was not an exhibit. Make sure you receive an audio wand which will make your visit that much more enjoyable. The current exhibit, \"Town and Country: From Degas to Picasso\" was organized in conjunction with MOFA in Boston. I did not feel many of the works on display represented the featured artists, including van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, and Toulouse-Lautrec, best work though the informative panels accompanying each work of art and the recorded description (see audio wand) proved to be interesting.\n",
      "One of the best art exhibits I have ever seen was an O'Keeffe Stieglitz presentation here; it was so personal and detailed. Really an in depth gorgeous experience. This was a few years ago. This time it was an exhibit on the human form. Although it was much much smaller than the O'Keeffe exhibit it was nicely put together with notable pieces from Renoir, Picasso, Hockney all the way to a Cindy Sherman photograph. Good variety, but small. This is one of my favorite places to go in Vegas and will go every time I visit; LOVE IT! P.S. It is so f-ing LAME people complain about the price- morons! It costs $15 for a sandwich on the strip and 3 seconds to loose $15 gambling STFU!\n",
      "I hear that they also have other attractions in Vegas, like gaming. And shopping, and fabulous restaurants, and pools with plenty of sunshine. However, my primary reason for visiting Vegas is the art. I first attended the Impressionist show at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art about five years ago, and was duly impressed and surprised by the scholarship and selection of the work. As a former museum professional, it made sense that Vegas would have the money to pay for the crating, insurance, and exhibition of priceless works of art. Having worked at a major Modern art museum, it was also a pleasant surprise to use the audio tour to hear the level of scholarship that was available to the casual art viewer. I have seen every show at the gallery since the first show. My first stop in Vegas is this gallery, now that the Guggenheim branch at the Venetian is closed. I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature. There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint. One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble. The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated. I do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price. However, as an art history teacher, I have had to buy museum memberships in order to see large shows at major museums, not to mention the added costs of parking and transportation to reach destination cities. This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal. This gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum. These shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind. The book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding.\n",
      "I use to come here a lot, every Wednesday if 50% off for locals! The only problem is that this place looks in art... I know this is not LA or NY, I'm not asking for a real art gallery, but this is Bellagio!!! I'm expecting way more, or make it free ! Andy Warhol collection was disappointing, with only few of his work pieces...\n",
      "The works of Picasso are impressive and very profound. We arrived 10 minutes before their last tour. As soon as we walked we rushed to view all of his art because they were closing soon. Make sure you don't wear a coat to the gallery because it's humid. I had a pleasant night alongside my best friend, we enjoyed seeing a variety of his work and the metamorphosis his work went through, throughout the years. I find his work to stir many emotions and constant battle though surrealism and the steady depth in the color and canvas. I am the happiest girl on earth to see his work before they left to his family estate in Spain. For my first time viewing his work and standing to it so closely, I felt as if I was at his house, and Picasso opens the door to his villa and welcomes us delighted to show us his passion and inspiration. 43 years later he will forever be one of the greatest. I do have one small complain and that was the woman who worked inside the gallery of who gave us attitude thought the entire exhibition, she constantly displayed her negativity and couldn't stop staring. I hope next time she doesn't interrupt us, she was rude.\n",
      "Saw the Andy Warhol Wild West Exhibit here and it was so cool! Ive seen his other work at the MoMA in NYC and those were also rad. The work shown here, however, is probably not as popular to the public as those shown at MoMA. We were given an audio device that you hold up to your ear and it plays information regarding the artwork. It was nice to hear the history behind the art and really made me appreciate it more. My favorite were the polaroids that Andy Warhol took of celebrities and of himself - so perfectly imperfect. Very small gallery though. I love art so this was a nice treat for me and worth the $16 general admission.\n",
      "I appreciate art, but certainly not a sophisticate. Or rich. Wanted to come here because the exhibit was Women in Art, so brought my two young daughters. My family has visited several art museums across Europe, so I knew the girls would be interested. I knew the price before visiting. Kids are free and retired military was $11. What makes me give it a meh was the size of the exhibit. There were probably 30 paintings, 20 of which had audio (with an included audioguide). Hard to spend more than an hour there, which might be nice for the casual observer, but disappointing when you factor in the value. Normal admission is $16 - for comparison's sake, entry to the Louvre is 12 euro, about $16. There are two Georgia O' Keefe's in the gallery, and to me the most impressive pieces of the exhibit.\n",
      "I was very impressed by the Yousuf Karsh exhibit. Included with admission is a self guided audio tour. All you have to do is dial the number next to the picture into your handheld device and you can hear a short narration. The Icons of the 20th Century exhibit is on display until 9/5/16 so be sure to stop by. There's a small gift shop located adjacent to the ticket booth.\n",
      "Me personally I didn't like it all it taste weird to me and it smelled like a dead animal n my opinion I will not return to any because it's just not for my taste buds the staff was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and suggestive selling... The lines can be long but that's expected need more setting...it was pretty clean Overall I rated it 2 stars because of staff....\n",
      "I had only ever heard legends of White Castle burgers whether it was through the Harold and Kumar movies or the frozen versions at Albertsons. I was pretty excited to learn that White Castle was fairly new to Vegas so the hype was intense. The line is crazy and the menu is like nothing i've seen before. You basically order for the group or small orders for 1 person. Obviously we went for the 20 burger combo with fries and the chicken rings. Seeing how the burgers are made is mesmerizing. The kitchen is pretty open compared to other fast food restaurants where large machines cover the process. White Castle however lays everything out for you to admire and salivate while you order. They cover the grill with the chopped onions and then place the patties on top. It is definitely a sight to see. 20 minutes later, we got out food which was well worth the wait. Those little sliders are so delicious and fresh. You almost feel bad as you count how many you eat from the 20 burger combo. The onions are probably my favorite part. The fries are really nothing special and i would not order them again. The chicken rings are pretty good but are pretty basic tasting compared to Burger King's. I ate 6 sliders by the way...\n",
      "This iconic bigger chain popularized mini slider burgers. I found them fairly tasteless, skimpy, and unsatisfying. Going in I had very low expectations of the burgers but even then I was not satisfied with the product. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I will definitely not be going back.\n",
      "The atmosphere is very loud and crowded joint. The casino is next to the restaurant so you can hear people gambling and making noise. I instantly noticed this place was popular due to the large line, so I was intrigued to see what all the fuzz was about. Ordered items: Combo #2 which came with 4 cheese sliders, some fries and a drink. The burgers were nothing special. They were good, but I will definitely not go out of my way to get these burgers. I would say 4 sliders are equivalent to 1 full size burger. I was told this place is the east coasts in-N- out. In my opinion, it doesn't come close. The concept is interesting with the sliders, but the overall quality of the burger Isn't great. Overall, it was an interesting experience. The line was too long and the burgers were average. I would recommend you only try if the line are short and you're very hungry.\n",
      "WHITE CASTLE --- Not worth the wait-- I was so excited to have a white castle open in LV like so many east coasters and went today. What a disappointment!! First timers are going to wonder what all the fuss is about . The burgers were lacking flavor, not hot and you had to look for the onions - and as we all know that gives this little (but expensive) burger the flavor and steam needed to make that bun so special. Neither were there. The bun top actually made it a bit dry since there was NO ketchup and cold! As a local, I will buy the frozen ones and not make the trip to the strip for this $1.29 miss . At least when heated they possess the flavor we remember even adding your own ketchup and pickle\n",
      "Came here last week for lunch. Finally made my way here 11 years after the movie. I didn't have too much expectation coming here. Had the regular beef sliders, chicken sliders, and cheese fries. The beef I found was pretty thin, but the toppings and the fluffy bun def made it taste above average. The chicken lacked toppings and was a tad dry. The cheese fries are good, but you could probably make your own easily at home. Overall, it was a mediocre experience for me. At the end of the day, it's fast food. So if you just want something relatively quick and cheap, this could be one of your options.\n",
      "The only white castle burger I've ever had prior has been the microwaveable frozen kind. A last minute decision to eat something reasonably priced lead me here. So here's my verdict: Cheeseburger- 2.5 stars Jalapeño cheeseburger- 3.75 stars. The white cheese is a nice change of pace from American cheese, adds a slight kick and adds an extra oomph to the overall burger compared to the regular cheese. Fish burger- 3 stars Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average. Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food. 7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19. I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeño cheeseburger.\n",
      "Overpriced and halfassed I am a NJ native and have had white castle for over 15 years. This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it. First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles. I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome. Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said \" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it\". Second issue was the quality. The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up. Third issue was the fries. They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles. Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers. This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears. If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one.\n",
      "I have only been here twice at this location. We don't live far but both times we have gone there, food was very good :-) Fast service!\n",
      "I wish this place lived up to the hype. I mean Harold and kumar had a whole adventure trying to get to this place! Anyway, we came in at around 6pm on a Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a long line. We ordered sliders with the American cheese and jalapeño cheese, fries, chicken rings, onion chips, and a drink. We also got the brownie and cheesecake dipped in fudge for dessert. We wanted to try everything on the menu basically lol the food came out pretty fast. It really fell flat on the food. Everything was really bland. There's no seasoning whatsoever on anything. The sliders were kinda soggy. The onion chips had such a thick coating with no flavor. The best thing we had was probably the brownie for dessert lol it's cool to try if you're curious since it's quite famous. Just don't expect a lot so you won't get disappointed.\n",
      "So we were vacationing in Vegas and got super excited when we saw a White Castle on the strip, living in the West Coast we've never tried it and heard how amazing these burgers are so we wanted to see what the whole fuzz was about. Oh man we expected too much those burgers were so gross it tasted like something you can feed to a dog, after the first bite I wanted to puke. It even got us sick ugh I seriously don't think it's real meat I don't know the quality was horrible. McDonald burgers even taste better, better yet stick to In N Out , best burgers ever and taste fresh unlike here , NEVER AGAIN , SAVE YOUR MONEY PLZ\n",
      "If you never tried it, must experience it. Great little burgers that will fill you up. 10 should be enough for a person. Good place for late night in Vegas. Opens 24/7. Line isnt so long. Worth to try and wait for. Great for hangovers after the club.\n",
      "White Castle was in Las Vegas as a food truck during the Las Vegas Foodie Fest previous years and the line for it was un-fricken-believable. Reportedly, people waited long hours for the infamous tiny sliders. I didn't wait for it personally, but I did see the extreme amount of people in line as I was exploring other (and better) food options. And now it's here not as a mobile restaurant, but an actual restaurant, hidden away in the Casino Royale. To find it, you need to walk a little bit, so make time for that. I don't mind playing tourist in my own city every now and then, but lemme tell ya, for White Castle? Not worth it! The little sliders are, at best, just cute. The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones. About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID! I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it.\n",
      "For a super busy fast food joint on the strip they are getting it done. Waited less than 5 minutes for my food, they clean off the tables as soon as anyone stands up. Ask for the dusseldorf mustard or you won't get it.\n",
      "Hi Mike my friend darzell MC joy applied there he is just waiting for you guys to call him\n",
      "Growing up back east we would go to white castle and get the burgers by the dozen. Of course that was many years ago and you could get them for around 25 cents, that's really showing how long ago that was. So I was glad to see one open here on the strip. So I packed up the wife (who never had one) and off we went. After a short walk and a short line we ordered. Shocked by the prices, but everything costs more today. Told the wife how good these were while growing up. I guess all things change from what I remember. As soon as I pulled the burger from the package it seemed the burger was way thinner than I remembered and after the first bite I was disappointed on the taste. Guess this is off our list on coming back along with the \"shake shack\" also. How disappointed this was from the memories of my youth. Pay a little more and find one of the other burger places nearby so not to be disappointed.\n",
      "I have always wanted to try White Castle; I have only had the frozen burgers. Needless to say when I saw a White Castle on the strip in Las Vegas I was ecstatic. The line to order moved fast, the line to pick up food was super slow but who cares its White Castle. The burgers are small and delicious, the bread was warm and soft. It was the burger slider.\n",
      "Harold and Kumar sure make it seem like this is the place to be. For many years, I have been wanting to try this hoping that I would be blown away from the taste. Since they do not have this chain down south, where I stay, I had not been able to taste it. Until one day, I was driving by the vegas strip and noticed it tucked deep in the sidelines of the Casinos. After some tricky parking, and a long trek I was finally at the register ordering the cheese slider meal. At first glance, everything seemed good, heck it sure did make for a great instagram post, which is mandatory for me on all food I eat. After the first bite, I was left unimpressed. I would easily rank Fatburger and In and out above this chain and even Mcdonalds. It was definitely great to finally try it but would not go out of my way to do it again.\n",
      "When I was living in Vegas, they didn't have a White Castle yet. This one is fairly new. I wanna say maybe a year now? Anyways, if you're in Vegas, White Castle is a MUST if you're on the strip. Especially when you're drunk. Their burgers are like sliders, small but they're less than $2! They are delicious! They are located near Fat Tuesday and Harrah's hotel. If you aren't in any of the states that has a White Castle, Target sells frozen boxes of White Castle sliders. It won't be the same but it's close!\n",
      "Have been a fan of White Castle for years! Started when I was a child getting their burgers frozen from the supermarket. At that time I never knew it was a restaurant. Then the popularity from Harold & Kumar happened making want to always try a White Castle restaurant. I finally had my chance this summer in Las Vegas! I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique. I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite! Would go back again next time I visit Vegas!\n",
      "This is a good place to come with friends. I was told to try these sliders by Chicago transplants in Las Vegas. I like the burgers, but, I am an In N' Out/ PDQ fan. The sliders are different, however, I have had tastier sliders in Phoenix and Oakland. They serve beer, so it's a nice break to the strip bars or ending the night with friends.\n",
      "This place was pretty good! Had never eaten there beforem the staff was efficent in how they made and delivered their food.\n",
      "OK, let's be honest here...if you like White Castle you like White Castle. There is no in-between. I grew up in the midwest, so I happen to love them! So, I can't help it... It is a true guilty pleasure. They are simply little steamed cheeseburgers of joy. Soft, fluffy and delicious! I always just get the cheeseburger sliders. The line here in Vegas can move slow if there are a crowd of people, but the burgers are as good as any White Castle in Chicago. If you crave...you crave...and this location delivers!\n",
      "I wanted to try this place because I heard from people that it was a good fast food joint. To start off, their location is quite terrible. Unless you are walking on the strip, it takes quite an effort to get to the restaurant since you have to go through people and traffic, park at a casino, then walk down the strip to eat here. When it comes to waiting, the time you wait in line to order is a lot longer than the time to get your food. My friend and I ordered #9, 3 cake on a stick, chicken rings, and onion chips. Literally, right after we ordered it took about 30 seconds for us to get all of our food. The quality of the food is disappointing and it might be because of how busy they are. The sliders weren't anything great and their fries are not crispy at all. Their chicken rings didn't have much flavor in them either. However, their onion chips and cheesecake on a stick were amazing. Their service is a lot better than I assumed. The worker who took my order was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone looks like they're trying their best to work as quickly as possible to meet every customer's needs. To be honest, White Castle is okay but it just wasn't for me. The food isn't worth the wait like people think it'd be.\n",
      "When the frozen burgers are better than the restaurant burgers, you have a big problem. Just. No. I'm sure the Midwest locations might be slightly better.\n",
      "Ever since I went to White Castle when I visited back east as a teenager I've always wanted to go back because I really enjoyed theirs food. Circumstances be as they may I've never been back east but low and behold they're here in Vegas which is way closer to California. Many people have ranted and raved about shake shack and after trying their much over hyped food my money is and will always be on White Castle. Better service and Better food. It's the way I remember it so many years ago.\n",
      "When I have been in the past it was always amazing but this time it sucked. They were not hot they were just warm and me and my friend did not feel well after eating there\n",
      "White castle is like bubba gump, famous from a movie. The only difference that white castle was in existence before the movie came out. We went to Vegas and slave girl has never been to white castle yet, so for love, I went to another bad place to eat. The service was actually good. The lady at the counter was super friendly and very pleasant. Ordering was easy and fast. Good job. We ordered a 10 pack burger with 6 pc chicken ring and loaded fries. Now on with the food. White castle burgers are cheap but small. The burger patty was thinner than a sausage patty but flavorful. However, the flavor was not the typical burger flavor and I wasn't a fan of that taste. The chicken ring was nuggets smashed with a hole in the middle. Dry and nasty. Our friend ordered this onion thing but it was also dry with almost no trace of onion. The only thing that was decent was the loaded fries. I think we just liked bacon. All and all, you gotta wonder why eating White Castle in Vegas when we were surrounded with some of the best restaurants in the country. Slave girl said never again, lol.\n",
      "We went here just because of the Harold and Kumar movie. Not worth the hype. The service was okay, but for the price definitely go somewhere else.\n",
      "Smaller menu and way overpriced compared to other white castles. If this was regular priced i would give it 3 or 4 stars because it is in par with most on the east coast but for almost $20 a person, no big red, and a really long line. I can only give it 2 stars but would doubt i would be back.\n",
      "The food was good as expected. However, the service was horrible. Shanon was there to give us our food but when we asked for sauces she was very disrespectful. We ordered a combo for 4 but she did not provide enough sauces for us. Also her side comments were very unfriendly when I pointed at the sauces she threatened that she would \"slap my hand\". I would say she is unfit for that position and she should just stay at the back of the house away from customers with that kind of attitude.\n",
      "Okay, don't expect any good quality food here. The White Castle sliders in the frozen section in most grocery stores tastes almost EXACTLY like the sliders you will get here, except here, it's freshly cooked and not soggy! You basically come here just cuz you can say you went to White Castle (without going to the East Coast). The perfect snack after a day of drinking lol!\n",
      "I had to give them a 4 stars for not putting mustard and catchup on the burgers, but it was clean, the staff was really friendly, and the wait wasn't terrible.\n",
      "I won't rate based on long lines and wait times. You obviously see how long the line is and should be able to judge that that wait will be lengthy. You get in line of your own free will, if you don't want to wait then go elsewhere. I also will not rate based on comparisons to other fast food empires (in-n-out, shake shack, McDonald's, etc). What I am basing my rating in is the food. Let me be completely clear here...if you have ever had the frozen, microwaveable grocery store White Castle sliders then be advised that it is EXACTLY the same as what you will get here. Kudos (I guess) to whoever produces the frozen versions available at the grocery stores because they have 100% matched the taste, consistency, texture and quality of the famous White Castle slider. I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff at the market so I certainly would not ever walk in to another White Castle brick & mortar restaurant location. Sorry but there are WAY too many quality options in town to even consider wasting my time, money, or tastebuds on White Castle.\n",
      "So our 1st time @ a real White Castle. ..not at the frozen isle....not bad bout the same tho....they had beer on tap a plus ! Hmm just not that exciting.....very pricey but it is Las Vegas. ...sure I'd go back if I was real hungry. ..\n",
      "So worth it. Probably not for everyone's taste though. (4 of the 5 of us loved it. One whined cause onions. *rolls eyes* kids.) My only problem with it is the location. Here I was hoping it would be in like Luxor or maybe even Excalibur (far better placement). As a non-smoker with severe asthma, I was coughing my lungs out to get to it through the casino, and continued to cough while I tried to eat. Next time I'll send someone in to buy, and we'll leave after. -_-\n",
      "Update: apparently they are supposed to be soggy, so if you like soggy buns then this is the place for you.\n",
      "Food 10/10 we bought a box of frozen White Castle cheese burger and loved it. The real store is way better Ambience 6/10 it's on the Main Street of LV, not great but understandable Service 7/10 We cannot wait to come back again\n",
      "I had high hopes for this place. First off they had my order wrong the lady working the cash register was rude and the food was terrible. The french fries were the only thing that I liked. The burgers were just plain gross. For my first ever visit I had a terrible experience I won't be coming back to this place ever.\n",
      "A White Castle on the west side of the country! Being from California, I'm surprised they have invade this state yet. Tried the Las Vegas location on a short trip recently. It's a bit tough to get to. I parked at the Venetian and took the long walk all the way to the strip to get to the restaurant. It's not necessarily big but there should be enough tables to accommodate who's in line. If you've had White Castle before, I always say its good if its late night eats or if you're pretty drunk, or both. Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great. In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side. A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax. Not really cheap. You actually might still be hungry after that. I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck.\n",
      "The line moved pretty fast. I was in and out with my food within an hour and half. The food was amazing!! Totally worth the wait! Yes the prices were higher as if you were to go back to the mid west. However you have to take into count that. Mid west is cheaper. This is Las Vegas. And also it's the strip everything on the strip is priced higher. So can't complain. Def worth waiting in line for!!\n",
      "Being from the Midwest I've had plenty of experience with White Castles so I was excited when one was opening here in Vegas. The first time I went there was good. I know it's on the Strip and I expected it to be packed so that wasn't a problem. I went here a second time and this is why I won't ever be back. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I finally ordered a dozen burgers to go. I don't care for onions so I ordered those burgers without them and the lady repeated that. I waited several more minutes for them to come out--my mistake was not checking them in the restaurant. I drove all the way home only to find out these burgers had been completely caked in onions. After scraping off a massive amount of onions, reheating the burgers and having my meal I decided to call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake. I was surprised when no one answered. I tried a few more times. Nothing. The next day I tried calling and still nothing. So I left a voicemail with my contact information. I waited a few days and received no type of reply back. At this point I gave up. If they can't even reply to a customer then they don't deserve my business. White Castle can be good but this location has a big ego being the only one in Vegas. If you do encounter a problem you will have to personally go in and inquire about it. No one cares enough to call back. Just a forewarning.\n",
      "I am from the Chicagoland area so I have been eagerly awaiting a WC to come to my area. Only gave a-ok due to two things... 1) The fries were almost hot but considering there was a line to order and pick up, can't figure out why the fries would not be cooked properly and served hot. 2) Parking..... Good luck if you don't know the area, OR park at Venetian and walk down to the Strip. The burgers were awesome! Didn't like that you could only order burgers in a combo fashion. Prices are high!! But I suppose that is to be expected on the Strip. Hate to say it, and I prefer In-n-Out..........\n",
      "It was exactly as how I expected it to be. Sliders were just like the frozen ones I buy at the grocery store. People hype up this place too much and I blame Harold and Kumar for that. Food here is just like the food at the White Castle in Chicago. Beef patties are thin, just like the frozen ones. Slider is small, exact size like the frozen one. Service here is ok, just like how it is at with any other fast food chain. They do however, have other options to choose from other than cheese sliders and the original sliders. Line is long but moves quickly and food comes out quickly. Just like any other fast food joint. Don't come here and expect it to be a 4 star restaurant. It's just another 3 star fast food place.\n",
      "I would give this place a MINUS one star if was possibly. Just another tourist trap on vegas strip. Over priced junk food. Meat that tastes like wet carboard, bland fries, NOTHING special about this place. If this is one of the best burger restaurant chains in the east coast, and people like this crap, i would call them: \"IGNORANTS\" Another McDonald's dollar menu contestan that lose the battle......(and that's sad !!)\n",
      "What kind of ghetto operation is this? Big sign saying open 24/7, but when I get off at 5am they are closed from 5 to 8am. What a joke. I am thoroughly pissed. You are false advertising. F-/&$k you White Castle!!!!!\n",
      "Meh. It tastes like the ones you buy in the frozen aisle and is nothing special. Harold and Kumar what were you thinking... oh right...\n",
      "This is nice as a quick little snack. If there isn't a line, it's nice to pick up just a couple little sliders. This last visit we tried to make it a meal, and ordered one of the big combo meals, but it's just too much fast food for me. I guess I just much prefer a real burger with all of the vegetables.\n",
      "after years and years of making microwavable white castle burgers, my drunken self brought my drunken group here after too many Fat Tuesdays! i ordered 4 of the cheeseburgers and my god these are heavenly! the right amount of grease from the grill, nice amount of onions, a slab of cheese, a toasty bun to soak up the flavors, the pickles however i was not a fan of and actually was not aware that they were on the burgers but it was not a big downer to the burgers! one of my friends ordered the chicken rings and these were basically like chicken nuggets but better! it isn't the cheapest but also not THAT expensive, i think my four burgers came to about $8? i would love to stop by again for a snack or quick bite next time in Vegas!\n",
      "More hype than anything. I've had my share of burgers including WC in NYC and they did not bring their A-game to LV. Long lines, greasy burgers, no seating, and wafer thin patties for a premium price. Also, if you've had WC on the Easy Coast, you'll be disappointed to find that they only sell the regular or cheese burgers and you can't buy them individually. Only in meals. I was pretty hungry the day I went, and didn't even eat all of my burgers. And it wasn't because I was full. Nuff said.\n",
      "Overhyped! I don't get why people are so crazy about this place Had this three times over my last Vegas trip but only because it was close to the palazzo and conveniently open 24hours so we could grab some grub after the club. It was okay the first time because I was drunk but the second night I was sober and it's really just mediocre. Everyone else devoured the sliders but I was far too sober to be enjoying them. Tastes like something I could've heated up from my freezer. Pack of 10 costs about $11 and $3 extra if you want to add cheese But there's really nothing special or note worthy about the food. It's just convenient and cheap considering it's Vegas Might come back but only if I have mad drunchies next time I'm in Vegas\n",
      "Ok ok ...so you know how I was major hating on White Castle in my first review...well, I'll give it 3 stars this time around! Came here on Fat Tuesday after some drinks at The Linq. Ordered the 10 mini burgs with cheese, large fries, cheesecake, and cheese sticks. It was cool. I mean, for $20 or so, it was cool. Burgers were hot, fresh, bite sized. Cheesecake was REALLY small for being a cheesecake (on a stick!). I think the plus was the funny cashiers and the 10% OFF FOR LOCALS!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I am from the East and have eaten white castles for a long time. I love them and couldn't wait for them to get here I went the opening day. i was not happy with the price. They should be ashamed for charging people so much. I brought them the first day and will not come back. $8.99 for 4-cheeseburgers, fires, and soda are you people crazy. My 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .I paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers. That was my usual order after the club in Chicago and Minneapolis. It cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time I had them in Minneapolis. I have not lived here that long so I have recently had white castles. Just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference. That is just pure greed!!! if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason I would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again. It is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break. This is why I am only giving one star and I hope others follow suit.\n",
      "Didn't wait in line but their sliders are blah. Honestly they have so much hype surrounding this place which is good for them but their sliders could use some magic touch to it. Maybe I gotta eat this shit stoned but yo it is not worth waiting in line. Another overhyped east coast - mid-west chain that thinks they can fuck with the west coast powerhouse In-N-Out. Unfortunately they got KTFO...\n",
      "I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from \"Harold and Kumar\"). There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub. Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A. But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again: \"Cheese Sliders\": These sliders vary slightly from the \"Original\" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these). \"Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken\": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the \"Cheese Slider\" that I had. \"Western BBQ Grilled Chicken\": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day. \"Fish Sliders\": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form. \"Loaded Fries\": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day. \"Brownie on a Stick\": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this. \"Cheesecake on a Stick\": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...) \"Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider\": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured.\n",
      "Juste bon pour se caller Point positif : pas cher du tout\n",
      "It's possible that I'm just an easy sell when it comes to nostalgic food items, but I've always enjoyed their sliders ever since I knew how to use a microwave, so despite the fact that they're greasy and incredibly junky, I still love em! They taste exactly like the ones you find at the frozen section of your local grocery store/7-11 (after they've been defrosted/heated, of course).... even though they're supposed to be *somewhat* more fresh when prepared right away. Really, it's not any different, so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas, unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings, fries, etc. If you're planning a visit anyway, the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you, but I always felt awkward biting into an onion \"ring\". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York, and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu. The mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons, so if you and I share that intense disgust for it, stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh! I'm not an active environmentalist, but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter, so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate, and typical wrappers would've squashed them.\n",
      "Ate at the new White Castle today because there has been so much buzz around Vegas. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The food is better than McDonalds but I've had better sliders at BJ's. Compared to In-n-Out or Five Guys, this place is waaaay down on the list of best burger joints. All you east-coasters that rave about White Castle - maybe you need to eat at a west-coast joint...\n",
      "Good burgers. Burgers taste a little better than the frozen packs I buy at the store. The fries are good. I will be back.\n",
      "White Castles are my favorite. They started in Wichita but Kansas has no White Castles. Go figure. Las Vegas White Castle opened in January. Order the family pack with 10 or 20. Fries or onion petals atr a must. Cheesecake on a stick is great\n",
      "I was surprised to find that this East Coast chain had found its way to the Las Vegas Strip. So I figured, let's find out what Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about. At first I wasn't that impressed. BUT, for some strange reason, I kept finding myself coming back every night to soak up the day and night of drinking. That smell of grilled onions had such an aroma that I couldn't stay away. I know it isn't the highest quality or best burger, but it got the job done. I found myself ordering the 4 burger meal. They even sell a \"Sack\" or case of burgers (up to 100) AND they serve beer here. Great Combo. I will be back WC. Oh yes, I will be back.\n",
      "Well, my experience at White Castle Las Vegas was consistent with a lot of others: just short of bad. We stopped by midday and ordered one of the slider meals, adding mozzarella sticks to it. In the long wait for our food, I noticed that every person working behind the counter looked miserable. Everyone. The food that comes out of this kitchen (despite its fast food quality) does not equate to the product sold elsewhere. Add to this the fact that prices are marked up to \"Strip value.\" Come to the Casino Royale to grab a few cheap beers at the bar adjacent to this place, but don't feel bad if you decide to skip White Castle.\n",
      "Rumors raved about White Castle and their arrival here in Vegas. I gave into the flock and went to try it out. I hate myself for not checking yelp first. I have no clue why anyone would waste a moment on this food chain. The line was incredibly long, they required three guards to monitor. Three. I expected a drunken brawl to pop up with this level of security. I ordered a 10 slider pack, 2 fries, 1 onion chips, and 2 drinks for $26. There were no seats so we had to snatch a table at the Subway nearby. The wait was long but the word \"crave\" was scattered all over the walls so I thought that is had to be worth the wait. Welp, I was wrong. I wasn't surprised by the size of the slider, they are meant to be tiny and cute, but I've seen cheese slices thicker than these meat patties. And overall it was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. Crinkle cut fries should have that extra crunch but these were limp and bland as well. Everyone knows to salt the fries straight out of the fryer, except these guys. I sampled a chicken ring from a friend. It's cute but nothing special. My friend did find a little bone in one of his rings. At least we know it's real chicken. The only star of the whole meal were the onion chips. I loved the assembly line but I was disappointed that all of that hard work for food that tasted microwaved. Oh, and did I mention that this morning I woke up to the sound of my boyfriend hurling his heart out? Keep in mind that we were sober all night. Definitely not worth the trip.\n",
      "I don't know what the heck Harold and Kumar were on when they got white castle but boy do I wish I had some of that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgiiS1fjoUY So growing up, I've had White Castle burgers from the frozen aisles and I loved it. However, after watching Harold and Kumar, I've always wanted to try White Castle. Luckily, they finally opened one up in Vegas in Casino Royale and I just had to give it a try. Just walking in, there isn't much separating white castle from every other fast food joint. I ordered 4 cheese burger sliders with some fries for around $8. Boy, did this place suck. Honestly, minus the cool boxes the sliders are in, the cheese burgers here taste the same as the burgers I microwave. Same goes for the fries. Just salty empty carbs... Overall, this place disappointed me. Next time, I'll just buyer the microwaveable ones and just eat those or I can go to the millions of better burger joints in the area.\n",
      "I guess I'm like the other hundreds of customers, that ignored the two stars and came to check out White Castle for myself. I have been wanting to try this place for years, so glad when I finally see it in Vegas. Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it. The fries were mediocre, but probably taste better with toppings. Overall this is a great late night munchies spot and I am sure to return.\n",
      "I don't know what to think other than I am getting old. You either love this place or hate it. Yet I'm both. I love it while eating it but hate it while I burp up onions all afternoon. I like White Castle's frozen burgers back home but I love the fresh burgers on the Strip. The pickle is an extra special surprise that is not on the frozen burgers. This may have been the last time I enjoy these burgers. I've loved them all my life but the onion burps are just too much! (It's really bad when you know your own breath stinks!)\n",
      "White Castle Burgers has finally decided to bring their iconic sliders to the West Coast! And Las Vegas is a great place to test the waters. Hopefully with the successes and buzz the Las Vegas store is gettin. There will be more stores opening soon! In the meantime, the one in LV on the strip across from the Mirage Casino resort will do, eventhough they charge an arm n a leg for a tiny burger! I remember it used to only cost 25 cents a slider in the NYC area.\n",
      "After hearing about White Castle for ages, I finally found myself near one in Vegas so my wife and I decided to give it a try. My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations. Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties. I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs) We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out \"Animal Style\" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side). The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted. Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the \"six dollar burger\" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single \"$.99 cent menu\" burger elsewhere. All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place! I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat.\n",
      "I had White Castle once before in when I was visiting Chicago and I didn't get it then. When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth. I am still firmly in the I don't get it column. There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water. The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something. Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much). I was underwhelmed by the sliders. The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider. The thing is mostly bread. Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in. We walked from the Venetian. Again, I just don't get the cult following. I'd rather spend a bit more and have something more substantial and a whole lot more flavorful!!\n",
      "First off, this place is white castle and is definitely not in the same leagues as bachi or even in n out for that matter. Essentially the competitors to this restaurant are establishments like mcdonalds and wendys but I would much rather eat there than here. 1. OVERPRICED! you get the 6 slider meal and i think it comes out to $12? WTF go to glaziers and get the 6 cheese for $4 guys. 2. It tastes exactly like the kinds you buy frozen. There literally was no difference at all in terms of taste. 3. Don't plan to go to hot yoga after because you will get bad gas. seriously... big mistake Overall: It's really overpriced and the taste is comparable to the ones you can buy frozen but I will say that they do not taste all that bad.\n",
      "\"It taste so good when it hits the lips!\" This is a Midwestern girls dream come true to the Las Vegas desert. The line wasn't too long. Came here at midnight on a Saturday after a concert. It's consistent taste to any other east coast location I have ever eaten at. Glad they made their way out here. It really seems to be a good location too. I will probably be back at some point. Good things come in small packages.\n",
      "I've watched the movie White Castle and they make White Castle taste like the best burgers ever, what a deception...yeah I know it's a movie, they marketed it very very well. The burgers were eh, wouldn't recommend, there are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas. The only good thing is that it's cheap...\n",
      "Shaylene gives amazing customer service and I didn't have a single problem even on their busiest days\n",
      "The movie \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better.\n",
      "While in town visiting Vegas, I had to stop by to taste a fresh White Castle slider. When you go to their site it will list numerous of locations near me, but that is because they sell the frozen sliders. There are no White Castle locations near me so I had to try one. As soon as I got there, there was plenty of seats and no line. It was in the afternoon when I got there. I was surprised to see they had beer there. That's cool! Beer and sliders. Great! I ordered my food and it came out quickly. Woohoo! I'm glad I came at the time I did since the place got busy as I was leaving. I went with the cheese sliders and fries. The sliders were warm and tasty. They were so good. The bread was soft and the patty was tasty. I wasn't expecting crinkle fries for the fries. They were ok. This is a place you should try at least one.\n",
      "This is essentially microwave food. I got chicken rings and fries, my husband got sliders. Everything tasted like it came from a box. Actually...I may have had frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets that were better than what I had at White Castle. I see why Harold and Kumar went after getting stoned--you would have to be under the influence of something to enjoy your meal. Plus, everything was really pricy. We paid $17 for microwave food. Never again!\n",
      "I grew up treasuring White Castle in Detroit in lines before Tiger games... Ooh...the thought of those sliders!!! But this location is not your typical White Castle-- it is \"on fleek\" lol. Clean and shiny, interestingly located in a casino but reached from the street. We grabbed a sack with cheese-- fries and drinks. Sliders very good.. Better beverage selection would be a plus. Customer service... Let's just say we think no one there wants to be there. At least they didn't last night. Overall, a worthy stop for the White Castle experience. Would rate Detroit #1, Vegas #2 and New York (Brooklyn #3)\n",
      "The movie was awesome, unfortunately can't say the same for the actual restaurant. I went to this specific White Castle during a Vegas weekend. I was expecting delicious small burger sliders with a side of fries for the amount of money I paid. It was horrible. And I don't blame any staff, this iPad to do with the quality of the burger. They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to \"put mustard on this review\" (and I wish I woulda put some On that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers. Good luck White Castle! Hope you get better, being this is our first west coast franchise. Ps: don't let the movie fool you!\n",
      "No wonder this place was featured in Harold and Kumar. You would need to be drunk or stoned to enjoy White Castle. I was so excited to try this because relatives on the east coast love White Castle. Plus Harold and Kumar made this place seem like some sort of burger godsend. What a load of crap. Crappy bread, patties, and fries. At least they did the job and the fries weren't too salty. But this is mediocre. In-N-Out is better.\n",
      "Stumbled upon this place while walking the Strip and I just had to try it just because. I only ordered a Cheddar Fries and 1 Burger. I am glad that's all I ordered because it did not taste good at all. First off, the service is cap. They didn't really care about you. The cheddar fries was nothing exciting, it had stale fries. The burger is just nasty! It's soggy with no flavor. Maybe if you are drunk and hungry you can eat here but other than that, I would pass.\n",
      "It's White Castle.. It's late night munchies.Grab a bag or box of burgers get a milkshake. The power is bulk burgers, you are supposed to buy a bunch of them. Not as good as a $10 burger? Yeah no kidding, Its a buck. I personally hold the pickle on the cheeseburger. The staff is great, and the lineup seems long but it does move along at a fair clip. Now open one in LA guys...\n",
      "The hype with this one was strong. What with the constant talk on local news stations, blogs, websites how could you not feel the pressure as a lover of food in Las Vegas? We were not immune to the build-up and thus had to see what we were missing all these years. We visited on a Saturday, early evening/late afternoon timeframe. The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the \"bread and butter\" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype. Guess it's just one of those things that you either get or you don't. And I don't.\n",
      "Leave it to Las Vegas to ruin a Midwest gem. I was looking forward to White Castle being here but it is definitely not the same. I expected there to be a wait so I won't complain about the 1 hour and a half that I stood in line but I will complain that the line is like General admission for the club. I don't think they thought thoroughly about having a line outside on a busy strip sidewalk. Also I wasn't that far back in the line so I thought once I got into the building I would be minutes from ordering. Okay so the food; when I received my burgers they were lukewarm after coming fresh off of a grill! I also ordered chicken rings and they didn't have honey mustard! Dont even get me started on the employees! They need to bring some people from the MIDWEST to train these people. For those who have not had White Castle before this is not what all of us Midwest folks were excited about! It wasn't nearly the experience from back home! I agree with those that said you can go to the frozen section for what they are serving up here. Also they need to figure out how to get one off of the strip and with a drive-thru and breakfast. I will not be returning to this location.\n",
      "Moved from the Midwest to Southern CA so this White Castles on the strip is the closest to me. Tastes good just like it does back home.\n",
      "This was our family's Christmas Day Lunch/Dinner (depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner). Seeing as my wife and I both love White Castle and there is not one no where near where we stay, this one was GREAT.\n",
      "Finally, I finally went to the restaurant that Harold and Kumar having to go through numerous of obstacles to just eat there. But luckily I didn't need to go through the Obstacles Harold and Kumar needs to go through lol. But I did get there at 3 am and the there's still like a 20 mins wait pretty impressive in my Opinion. Well I think the white castle slider was alrite, nothing special and crazy about it their fish white castle was pretty good I have to say. But honestly, I rather have a Mcdonald burger or an In N out burger than the White Castle with the fact that their price are pretty similar.\n",
      "Nasty!!! Our first experience here was when they first opened...its was good! Food was good, customer service was good. This time its completely different. Burns gross fries, horrible nasty \"customer\" service, sent the fries back to only get back-talk from one of the employees!! Who does that!!! I'm guessing poor management is to blame? I'm not sure. The only thing good was the sliders!\n",
      "Came here for the first time with my husband to see what all the hype was about. It was disgusting. I took 1 bite and was done. My husband forced himself to finish 2 sliders. We had stomachs afterwards. They tasted not fresh and maybe even frozen. Buns were soggy and meat slices are super thin. I got cheese fries and they were ok, nothing special. Only good thing we experienced was great customer service from the cashier. I wish I would've caught her name, but she was the only good thing that came off that place. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n",
      "Burgers were good first time eating here heard a lot about it wanted to try it out taste was good on the sliders fries were alright will be bringing my girl and the kids\n",
      "Yes I know. One minute I can go from a gourmet Gordon Ramsay BurGR to straight ghetto White Castle belly bombers in an instant, haha! What can I say! Well I can say, \"If you didn't grow up with White Castle, then you'll probably NEVER understand the sensation of biting into one of these heavenly sliders!\" Just keep in mind, they're NO comparison to a normal burger like In-n-Out. So believe me, I'm McLovin' all the negative reviews. Yes they're cute tiny little burgers and can be eaten in four bites. But that soft steamy bun with a little bit of chopped onions, pickles, and melted cheese (or without) are just the best! Not as healthy as a four start chain Habit Burger, or as beefy as Five Guys, but more of an \"if I had a fast food burger choice\" of a burger chain; I'd choose the Dub C! I mean, they made a movie out of it! Plus I grew up with them in St. Louis, so it's a personal choice! Located in the Casino Royale, and the only location in the west coast; It's conveniently sitting between Fat Tuesday and Walgreens. And thank goodness for being 24/7, as it's a great pre- or post-party snack! Regarding service, it's fast food, not fine dining. Luckily I had no issues with service, but what do you expect? Just order and scarf them down!\n",
      "I think I was more excited about the fact that I got to finally try White Castle than I was about the actual food. My girls and I checked it out after a night of club hopping--and this food is perfect for that sort of situation. I HATE onions, but was so tired I ended up eating them anyway. The burgers weren't horrible, but they weren't amazing either. I know that folks say they're like Krystal's burgers, but I liked them better...although I couldn't tell you the last time I had anything from Krystal's. All in all, the restaurant wasn't great, but being able to experience it during an awesome Vegas vacay made it worthwhile.\n",
      "My husband has always loved White Castle so of course once he found out there was one a block away from where we were staying (the Venetian) we had to stop in and grab a bite to eat! Thank god this place is 24 hours because the best time to eat it is when you're good and drunk and that is usually late but then again it's Vegas we are talking about! Lol when are you not good and drunk? Anyways!!!!! Awesome drunk food for sure! And it's nice that it's cheap too!\n",
      "I've been buying White Castle slider burgers from the frozen section at Walmart for years and always wanted to try the real thing. I finally had the chance this past weekend while in Vegas and it was awesome. Everything I'd hoped it would be. My wife and I ordered 20 beef sliders, 2 small chicken rings, and 2 fries. It ended up being too much food but was still worth every penny I paid. Will definitely return on my next trip.\n",
      "They've lied to us people.... i don't know how they were able to make a movie about it.\n",
      "It is over hyped. I've heard about how amazing this place was but it's actually ok. This place isn't bad, just did not even reach anywhere near my expectations.\n",
      "OK I was born and raised in New Jersey where there is white castle all over the place I remember when he first got here to Las Vegas and me and my nanny and son went here for the first time Yes it's the exact same but it is much larger and caters to a lot of tables and there is a beer offering and it's pretty cool how they fill the cups The only thing that is a complaint is the fact that it's three times the cost as a normal white castle visit. This white castle did in fact run out of hamburgers when it opened on The strip I remember the day that it happened and it made headlines It's kind of like a classy white castles if there such a thing\n",
      "OK, White Castle virgin.. I know, I know, but truth. Listen Vegas is an experience and so is White Castle apparently. Silly me, Saturday night on the strip, but friends were here from NYC and they insisted. Wait outside in a line of people walking past asking \"What are you in line for?\" Had to resist answering \"Hookers and Blow.\" Then wait in a line inside, and folks they are SERIOUS about that line, to include security guards to direct traffic. Our troop goes in deep and orders a suitcase of burgers (a flippin suitcase of burgers) 2 onion rings (more like onion chunks, better than rings) and 1 fry. I have no idea what I am in for, but I am ready, I mean it is food, burgers and fries, hello.. Yes lord! This is a tasty burger! I don't care for pickles, so I toss em, but the burger itself is damn good.. About 4 bites (watching my table mates who apparently never eat in public is where I glean this information) and that burger is no more. I will be back, someday.. It is on the strip, I avoid the strip for too many reasons to list. However, White Castle is a good lure, so it might be sooner rather than later. TIP: Order more than you think you will eat, you don't want to get back in that line!\n",
      "Loads of interesting options. They have great combos, all sliders. If you are in a group better get their Castle packs which are great. The place is crowded, so ensure you have time to wait in line. Quick service though. Pretty organized. Best part: they make their sliders fresher in front of you. They are NOT reheated when you order.\n",
      "OMG! My favorite vacation spot meets my favorite burger! The sliders were delicious along with the iconic fries. I recommend everyone go here while on the strip\n",
      "It's been a few years since we had White Castle so when we found out they were opening a location in Vegas we wanted to visit. I was little disappointed about the location. It is connected to Casino Royale and there is not much seating here. The restaurant was dirty and they didnt have any staff cleaning up the tables. The line was long but it did move fast. The burgers didnt taste good as I remembered. Maybe because it's been a few years but I was happy to get my White Castle fix.\n",
      "This place is good! short lines and fast service. I ordered about 30 burgers and they came out fast, i ordered them for the drive home and my group ate them all before we can get half way home. Defiantly worth visiting here.\n",
      "The grossest thing I've ever consumed. I would've been better off getting the frozen ones from the freezer section. I will never eat this place again. And after we complained they didn't even seem to care nor bother to help fix the situation. Save your money, go somewhere else!!\n",
      "We don't have White Castle in California, so this was a must go for my husband. We loved the mini burgers! Preferred the original one patty more than the double. Bought extra to have in our condo for munchies and they reheated well in the microwave. Total yummers!\n",
      "I really enjoy the simplicity of these little sliders. The onion chips are my favorite side. The fries are average, but I'm not really a potato person in general. The frozen cheesecake on a stick is worth the trip alone. I admit that when I first tried this place it took a while to grow on me, but now I really crave these simple little burgers. I try to stop in every couple of weeks for a quick bite. I avoid the weekend tourist crowds and always stop there for weekday lunch. My parking experience has improved since I discovered the back entrance. The only bad thing about this place is getting in and out of the parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault so I won't ding them for that. I also get a kick out of the people walking out with two suitcases full of these things. Like they're buying enough to feed a whole plane.\n",
      "It tastes like the frozen burgers i used to buy at the grocery stores. They do come in cute boxes though, and if you get a combo, its decently priced. Not too bad, but nothing to rave about. It's inside the Harrah's hotel.\n",
      "This isn't the best of anything by far but it's better fast food than the typical chains and their 24/7! And if your fan of the movie(Harold & Kumar) then you must try this place once cause those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store are fake and don't give White Castle anyway justice. I ordered a combo. *Sliders with cheese - Without the cheese they slider would suck so the cheese is good and def a must. *Fries - Crinkle cut and very lacking. Easy pass next time. *Onion Fries - Your combo will be much better if you substitute for these. I like these a lot better. I would probably recommend on skipping on combos and getting a sack. Because 4 sliders aren't really enough. Anyways White Castle isn't anything special but it is appealing at 4-5 AM, if you don't want Hash House or Earls. The service is like any fast food joint. I asked for ranch and the lady said she had to go to back and get some. I waited 5 minutes and she didn't move at all. She had the easiest job of handing out sauces and she couldn't even do that smh.\n",
      "I stopped at White Castle around 4 A.M. since it was near my hotel and open 24/7. I ordered 3 classic sliders while my friends ordered the original slider combo. The line was long and took me 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my food. When I got my food, I was disappointed. In no way did that resemble a burger slider. The bottom bun was so soggy that it stuck to the packaging. The burger patty was probably 3 millimeters thick. It came with one pickle and grilled onions. The fries were soggy as well and tasted like plastic. The fries tasted like they were frozen and reheated in a microwave. To top it off, the food was not worth the money. It costs almost $10 for a slider combo (drink, fries, 3 slider). I paid $1.30 for each slider that you could finish in 2 bites. The best part of the meal was the drink. The food here closely resembles the frozen, microwaved lunch you get in elemenatry school. One star because it is open 24/7.\n",
      "White Castle? My Wife and I were so excited to try this place and it was a major let-down. First off the food- ok the sliders are good, not great, and definitely nothing to rave about. The fries and mozzarella sticks are phenominal. Why the 3 stars??? Because the price, I know its the strip but for four slides, two small fries, two small drinks, and an order of mozzarella sticks, $27!!!???? You gotta be kidding me!? All in all i wont be back anytime soon. Thanks for nothing Harold and Kumar. P.S. note to management wipe down the tables and pick up trash once in awhile. Never too busy to keep up routine cleaning...\n",
      "OK, fact not the best burger in the world. Fact not the best slider in the world. However it is a regional thing. People flock to In-N-Out burger as soon as they land in Vegas not because it's the the best burger but because they grew up with in-n-out and the want the nostalgic feeling from their childhood. Just like many of us go to Chic-Fil-A every time we go to California! Service was friendly, dinning area was clean and the food was hot. If you have never had W/C give it a try you may just like it. If you want a GREAT Burger try the Burger Bar.\n",
      "I've always wanted to try White Castle, even before the movie came out and now that I've tried it...it's nothing special. I would rather have In and Out or eat at McD. The burgers lacked any flavor but at least the buns were good. I should've just went to Shake Shack against my better judgement. The best part of the meal was the chicken ring sandwich. Too bad 2 meals of chicken ring sandwiches and two sliders costed 25 bucks. Never again.\n",
      "Well Saturday night is over and what a better way to finish it than stop in for a few white castles, a Coke and some chili cheese fries\n",
      "My wife had bragged about White Castle for a long time about how good their sliders were and how you could eat a whole sack of them. When we got to White Castle my wife immediately ordered 20 for the two of us. After trying one slider I was so disappointed the burger was so bland and nasty. My wife was equally as disappointed and we both opted to throw them away rather than suffer through trying to eat them... Extremely disappointed and sad for my wife who thought she was going to enjoy a childhood favorite... I had better burger at McDonalds.\n",
      "This was my first trip ever to White Castle. I ordered 2 original sliders, 1 with cheese, and a side of fries. I have to say, I'm a big fan of the fluffy bread and onions. Fries were decent too, and not greasy. I usually just order hamburgers, but I must admit these sliders are much better with some cheese. White Castle is def a good snack as you walk along the Blvd. looking for trouble. Best to go during weird hours because that line can be Disneyland-long.\n",
      "I was excited to find a White Castle in Vegas mostly being from the east coast living in the west coast. The sliders were delicious and the staff were friendly. Although white castles don't have the best dinning ambiance the steamed, soft, melt in your mouth sliders is where it's at. I recommend you have the order to go to take back to your hotel as seating here is limited and kind of in a busy casino area.\n",
      "Ok so for those of us who have never ever had a White Castle from an actual \"White Castles\" I was so freaking stoked about my visit to this holy grail. I truly believe I had the exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box. As I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come true. The line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh. I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food. All in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can. So say what you want about this place I am just so happy that after all these years I Finally Made it to WHITE CASTLES!!!! Thank you for opening one up in Vegas. Oh and the staff was super nice too!!! ***OOPS I PUT THIS PLACE IS DRESSY BUT I MEANT CASULE*** I hope we all could figure that out! LOL\n",
      "1st time I had white castle sliders... woo-hoo! very delicious! cheap, yummy and fast on the strip! i like their fries - which are not salty, and chicken rings ! open up in canada, will ya!?\n",
      "They list this place as a fast food restaurant but more like a SLOW food Restraunt! The manager should be taken out back and beaten! 4th of July holiday and they have one person working a register and a line out the door! Heaven for bid the manager throws a few more employees on registers to speed up the process or hops on one himself! Worst run business! If u see a line go somewhere else like I did after waiting 30 minutes and not moving as it will be a two hour wait just to order!The debate of $15/hour makes me laugh when I see how a business like this is run! Can't wait till the day they replace workers with computers so we can place our own orders and not have to wait an hour in line at a Slow food Restraunt!\n",
      "I didn't expect much being that they only had sliders. But it was surprisingly good. The grilled onions make it worth it. Definitely enjoyed our dinner date on the strip!!!!\n",
      "Jalapeño double and onion chips/loaded fries are just so good, not anything like the frozen cheeseburgers quality. Get some Dusseldorf mustard and zesty sauce on the side.\n",
      "Food wasn't that good. I spend about $50 trying different things on the menu but it just wasn't worth it. Flavorless. Employees were friendly though, so that's a plus. Harold and Kumar should have gone elsewhere!\n",
      "It's White Castle. It's its own entity. It's not a hamburger as West Coasters (myself included) think of when you hear the word 'Hamburger'. Once you get into the idea that you're eating something completely different, you're on the road to success. I fell in love with these little onion-y meat and bun nuggets in Kentucky. I suppose if you hate onions, you'll hate this. The onions are cooked and the patties and buns are stacked on top steaming everything with that onion-y goodness. These were every bit as good as the ones I've had in Kentucky. Pro Tip: Get a side of onion chips, and order by the sack.\n",
      "I've been craving White Castle ever since Harold and kumar came out. I was elated when I heard they were coming to the west coast and was not disappointed. I'm surprised the location is so small so I can only imagine how quickly it fills up. I got the 2 double slider combo and was blown away. So meaty and cheesy, with the onions and pickle to cut through. No condiments necessary.\n",
      "I love White Castle so I was excited one was out my way!! But the parking is horrific because it's located on the strip!!! Sooo wish they would add another location with a drive thru in another area of vegas!\n",
      "My husband and I had never been to White Castle before so we decided to give them a try out of curiosity. We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad. We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly. I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the \"correct\" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled. I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks. I came, I tasted, too over-hyped.\n",
      "I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world. Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings? Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.\n",
      "Service was quick. Sliders are bomb. It's White Castle. Need I say more. Go there. Stuff your face. Drink a beer.\n",
      "Service was good. The cleanliness was a bit lacking as staff was not clearing tables very quickly. This would be 1 start if they didn't sell beer... The sliders are okay at best; I am unsure of where all of the hype comes from. If fast food burgers are your goal, I would pick In-N-Out before going to White Castle. If you compared it to any sort of restaurant style burger, you would remove White Castle from your memory, never to be thought of again. Don't want to make the journey to WC? The frozen versions from the Super Market are just as good as at WC.\n",
      "Located inside Casino Royal. Hubby and I had the late night munchies after a bit of a shopping. The line was kind of long, about a 15-20 minute wait then an additional 10 min wait. This was my second time eating White Castle. Their sliders were delicious. We ate a lot of them on the ride home. They are small and perfect, I don't get the same guilt trip I do when I eat other burgers. I tried the chicken sliders for the first time, it's not my cup of tea, I just don't think that chicken should be a burger, I also tried their bacon cheese fries, oh my.\n",
      "In a word, yuuuuuummmmmm!!!! So glad to find a White Castle out west! We walked from the New York New York casino up the vegas strip just to have some of these sliders and they were definitely worth it!!!!! Staff was friendly, kept the area clean which made our experience even better.\n",
      "I like the fish sliders the best. The chicken sliders are the fries kind of dry. The cheese burgers are good I can do with out the fries...\n",
      "To be fair, I've only had the frozen Costco version of these baby burgers and was only introduced to the chain by watching \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.\" Yup! My husband has never had WC before so we decided to give it a go. Located at the Best Western Casino Royale, it'll hit you in the face if you're walking down the strip towards Venetian. There are security guards standing at the doors and inside to monitor the lines. We came in at 10ish and were in and out in less than an hour. Guess everyone was still sleeping. By the time we left, the line was out the door!!! About the food: -Original Slider- plain as can be. Onions, beef patty -Cheeseburger Slider- comes with a pickle, onion and cheese. I liked this one best. Had the best flavor because of the pickle. -Chicken Ring Slider- two chicken rings with cheese. I wouldn't order it again and now understand why it needs the cheese. Without it.. Kinda dry. Fries- crinkle cut. Standard! The boo is a fan of the cheeseburgers goodness. My beef (hehe) is that I'm not a fan of the soggy buns. Sorry! I understand it's that way because of the onions soaking the flavor into them but... I like my buns firm ;)\n",
      "Well, I finally made it to a White Castle. It is what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more. And that's basically how a 24-hour food joint on the strip should be. Be noted that I came here right after having a Filet Mignon at Mon Ami Gabi, so I really came in here with lower expectations. I like cheeseburgers so I went with their Castle Combo No. 2 which had 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink (http://bit.ly/1d7fHzH). I can describe these little cheeseburgers in two words: Salt Bombs! These little suckers were pretty damn salty. I think after every bite I just keep going for my soda to soak it all up. Despite the saltiness, the cheeseburgers weren't that bad! But it might be because I had some alcohol beforehand. And definitely better than getting them frozen ones at the supermarket. For just under $10, the combo was decent. Luckily when I arrived to White Castle at around 10:30pm, there wasn't a line to order. So my experience was pretty quick as it should be. But when I walked by at around midnight, the place was super packed so I was glad that I just had beat the late night munchie rush. Amazing! Despite the novelty, I don't know if I'd come back to White Castle again. If I want a burger on the Strip late at night, there are plenty of other options at around the same price range.\n",
      "I honestly don't really see the hype about this place either. Ate here about two or three times during EDC week, because it was right next to our hotel, opened late (maybe even 24 hours?) and is cheap. The burgers are okay, cute and little but not really flavorful. Bland I might add. Fries are okay too. The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that. The employees are rude and the food doesn't really come out as fast as you would think for a fast food joint. . . Oh Harold & Kumar, you guys definitely got my hopes up. I can see how one may find this place delicious if under the influence of marijuana.\n",
      "Simply put - their burgers/sliders suck. I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia. I stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line. Great service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane. I've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri? Anyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1/18th of a pound of weird gray \"beef\" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day. I guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste. Also ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice. I would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper.\n",
      "I'd like to start this review with a question. On an average day how many sliders does this place serve? Pretty curios about that. Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars. PROS Same White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them here They serve beer which is pretty cool Dining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash CONS Location.. Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to Size.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through. Some employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls. Please expand into the local area!\n",
      "When I heard about White Castle coming to Vegas, I honestly got excited about it. I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!) Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store. The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast. It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one.\n",
      "It's located in castle royals, a junky little hotel...kind of gross & concerned me to it there. Food was ok, but not good enough to go out of my way to go again.\n",
      "This place is unexpectedly good!!! For a Southern California girl who has only ever eaten these things frozen I went in with pretty low expectations. But wow! They were warm and fresh and just good! The onion fries were also a nice surprise. I forgot to order the chocolate dipped cheesecake which was a bummer. Next time!! If you have never been here, I recommend ordering a few extra burgers. They go down easy, I ate three of them no problem! Perfect snack after a day of drinking! Down side is the line is long but that seems to be a Vegas thing anywhere you go! I will be back.\n",
      "This small square burgers are a joke. This mini burgers aren't clean and made me and my family go toilet three times. The tables aren't clean. It is way overprice and it's not even funny. It's over hype. Don't come here. My stomach still hurts from this shit these mass production tiny burgers are. Please don't come here. The kumer movie is fake. That's why I came here. It's tastes horrible. Other customers are saying it's a joke. This place is not clean.\n",
      "It was good enough now it isnt in n out but in n out has about a 30-45 min wait if you are walking the strip and looking for a burger that is quick and easy and good than white castle it is and ive tried the fancy burger places and they are about the same and longer wait at those places glad to see a white castle\n",
      "It's fast food people. Nothing over the top or special just a perfect snack when you have the munchies and wanna eat 10-15 sliders in one sitting and feel bad about yourself after breaking your diet lmao For me it's a throwback from when I was a kid eating those little burgers on the tailgate of my mom's station wagon at the drive in movies in Indiana. I moved to California and was excited to hear they opened a location in vegas because I wanted to taste a memory. 100% the same since I was 5 y.o. everything taste exactly the way I remembered. 10 soft little burgers and we'll done crinkle cut fries :) I felt guilty after eating it just like I would any other fast food binge eating session hahaha I see bad reviews. Don't overthink it people. It's only fast food. Enjoy responsibly\n",
      "Ok, I'm from Southern California, so I never really got the whole White Castle craze, since it was never in California to begin with. A recent trip to Las Vegas with my Chicago born girlfriend certainly changed it around for me. First, it's not the in and out type burger most will want. It's a small steamed burger, and it tastes great. Small sliders that are bite sized is what White Castle is all about. Quick service and overall great place in my mind. Yes, the prices were high, but drive 1200 more miles if you want the closer one, and you'll pay the higher than normal prices for them there. It's Vegas, get over it, most of everything in Vegas is overpriced. Great times and good food.\n",
      "I used to eat these when I was a teen, so I was super hyped when they opened here in LV...I went down to the strip (no parking) I ordered 10 sliders $16.00 they were 49 cents each 20 years ago???? they were so greasy I almost could not digest 2 of them. Know I know why my mother used to say when I was a kid that every time she ate them she got the runs....\n",
      "Had to come check this place out, I'd never had a fresh White Castle burger and I was not disappointed. I got the 4 cheeseburgers with fries and a drink, it tasted fresh and was nice and hot. The onions were a tasty addition and even though I could only finish three of the burgers and half the fries, it was really tasty! Would definitely go back.\n",
      "What can I say? It's White (mo fawkin) Castles!! Only complaint is we need some in California. I've been writing them for 30 years BEGGING!\n",
      "The food was ok. All the workers looked like they hated being here. All looked unhappy. The cashier seemed nice. Slow as molasses. I cashier for about 50 people in line. What a mess this place is\n",
      "Perfect east coast addition to the strip. Sliders were just like I remembered. Service was quick and easy.\n",
      "Have been wanting to try this place after seeing it in the movie years ago. finally one here in Vegas but we were not fans.\n",
      "Yay! White Castle west of the Rockies!!!!! Well located and easy to get in/out. Inside of the Casino Royale - next to Walgreens. Menu as you have memorized. Advice: Go in the daytime, buy a sack and put the leftovers in your room fridge for a late night snack. Oh so good. You'll thank me at 3am after a night at Omnia..... Special shout out to the Saturday morning staff (9am - 7/30/16) Super friendly and fast service. Kudos!!\n",
      "Sadly didn't live up to the hype. I've had frozen White Castle in the past. And who can resist coming here after watching Harold and Kumar go to White Castle :-) Anyway it wasn't bad but left me thinking.. \"Hey McDonald's is better.\" Burgers - Good, expected them to come out hotter though since I could see them making it in front of my face. Seems that they just serve the ones that have been sitting a bit though. GIVE ME THE FRESH ONES! Fries - Mediocre. Chicken Ring Burger - Nah, just cheese on 2 chicken ring. Fish Burger - Okay but no condiments.. just cheese on a piece of fried fish.\n",
      "This was my first time in a White Castle. I took the long line as a good sign. The music, videos playing, conversations, and sights made the long wait in line not so bad. Once we got our orders, we were able to find a seat, surprisingly. Burgers were cooked well. Chicken rings were crunchy.\n",
      "Ever since I was a kid listening to the Beastie Boys rap about White Castle, I have always wanted to go there. Living in So Cal, we don't have the opportunity. Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle. No traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going. Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location. The customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious. The burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING. I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed. I will definitely, be back when in Vegas again! Love White Castle.\n",
      "Authentic and typical White Castle...Except it's on the Las Vegas Strip. -Typical White Castle food, either you like it or you don't. -Prices are a bit steep, but it's a high rent location. -This location serves Beer! -Good central location on the Strip. -Friendly employees. -Restaurant was clean. If you want a White castle hamburger and not frozen from a supermarket...this is your only option on the west coast.\n",
      "I really had no desire to try White Castle. After seeing all the horrendous pictures of the barely edible-looking food, I was pretty sure I would never go, I was wrong. Out of sheer morbid curiosity, we arrived at White Castle a few weeks ago and saw no line and figured it was as good a time to try as any. We shared some sliders with cheese and chicken rings along with some fries. Prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected for the strip. I was surprised that the food wasn't as awful as I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily good, either. I favored the chicken rings to the sliders, which as people have noted are steamed and therefore have a mushy texture that I didn't enjoy. The fries were forgettable, so I'd avoid those. Their drink and ice machines weren't working and people were bottle necking fighting for the one side that was actually functioning. All in all, I guess I'm glad I gave them a try, but it looks like one and done for me.\n",
      "I was not wowed at all. We just wanted to try it. Had sliders and fries. Meat is thin. Buns are good but greasy. Too much butter. Fries are soft. Super crowded and seating is limited. I don't know what I was expecting but I left unsatisfied.\n",
      "Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!?!? A White Castle on the West Coast of America?! So to my surprise, I spot this gem and we decide to stop in and make it a White Castle kind of night. For a whopping $27-we got 10 cheese sliders, 2 cheese fries, and 2 drinks. Well worth it. So yum! Yeah, it's crap fast food but we couldn't pass it up. Girl at the front was super nice. It didn't seem like anyone hated their job. There was a constant line, so obviously business is well. Place was clean-they kept wiping up and such. Overall, I'll stop in again next time I'm in Vegas and if they are still there.\n",
      "I wish we had these in Canada!! Can't say too much other than the sliders are heavenly and hit the spot EVERYTIME! The bun is soft and a bit sweet. Meat is never dry. Ok I'm drooling... Time for another road trip.\n",
      "This Minnesota boy is now happy. Las vegas finally gets with the program and White Castle learns a lesson in economics (you go where your rabid fans are). yes it's a square, little hamburger. Yes, it was copied by some Schmuck named Krystal from the south who claims he had the idea when visiting St Louis World fair.. Some people pay premium dollar to say they have an iPhone, some people pay a price to eat a small, square burger that has its onions and buns steamed with the burger... This one serves beer... Bonus Points!!\n",
      "Looked good when Harold and Kumar ate it in the movie. Thought we gave it a try since it opened here. Much more costly than other states i heard as it's suppose to be a quarter each. We got 4 cheeseburger sliders with a drink and fries and it was $8.99. The sliders were pretty gross. I think some frozen sliders even taste better. The bread were soggy on the bottom as if my bun was accidentally dropped in water. What makes it worse is its not water but the bun soaked up the fat juice from the meat (which some may like but a soggy bun, no thank you). The meat looked old and not fresh at all. One picture that a fellow yelper posted says it all. Service was ok. Some were super nice while some looked as if they just crawled out of bed or have a bad hangover. Definitely a one time visit for me. Never again.\n",
      "White Castle in Vegas ? Whaaaat ? oh yeh, these were amazing little burgers. I've had these when I was in Ohio a few years ago and haven't seen a real location out on this coast except in Vegas. Give them a try.\n",
      "Alright, I've had White Castle once before this. I still don't get what the hype is about. I waited in line on grand opening night for a little less than two hours, met one new person (while waiting in line with) to be honest I was mostly excited to see the employees because as the they were leaving/entering all were excited. I payed a little less than $20 tax included for 4 sliders (okay), 2 sodas, 1 chicken ring box thing(mediocre), and a tiny cheesecake on a stick. The cashier that helped me was great! They didn't seemed overwhelmed at all despite the line going out and around the corner of the street. What's the 5 stars for? Because I'd go back for those tiny cheesecake sticks.\n",
      "This is the very 1st White Castle to have opened in the West Coast! It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state. The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section. I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast. After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film \"Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle\" was released in 2004. Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle. When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment. When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast. I had to give them a try! This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and \"people-watch\" the folks walking on the strip. As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle. Small portions & very greasy. You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry! What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer. It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night. In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's. It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain. It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip.\n",
      "Yes we went again. My first review was lower only because the Las Vegas prices are higher than what I'm used to in the Detroit area. Food was fine. This time we looked past the prices and just fixated on the food. The burgers were as good as any WC anywhere but the fries weren't exactly fresh. So while I could knock them for the fries, it's a White Castle and it was a WC experience The line wasn't long, the wait for the food was alright and the burgers were as good as any. They don't serve win mustard and ketchup but when you have such a massive operation as the LV location you make allowances. Kudos for a great \"dinner\". Work on those fries and we'll be back monthly because.....it's White Castle baby!\n",
      "I'm a Canadian on a burger mission so obviously I had to try White Castle. It's not as bad as everybody says it is!! The burger meat is weirdly thin and I question what kind of meat was used, but combined with the fried onion topping it's a pretty tasty burger! The fries sucked though. They were just bland. The old man working the cash was extremely nice. After we told him we're from Canada and it was our first time at WC he gave us a rundown of how they make their burgers and pointed to each station behind him as he explained the cooking process to us. He won a place in my heart that day. My only negative comment (other than the fries) was I thought it was going to be cheaper?? Maybe I got Vegas pricing...\n",
      "Greasy-gross-burped up that nasty onion taste the rest of the night. This place is not for me. Buns were good. I'm changing my review the responder is correct there are other items to try :) It's still fun to say u went there like Harold and Kumar lol\n",
      "I think I will stick with the frozen ones. The prices are overpriced and almost twice as much as the frozen ones that taste almost the same.\n",
      "Save yourself a handful of dollars, time, and driving-on-the-strip-ness and just buy a box of frozen ones at your local grocer. They'll taste better than the ones here and you won't have to deal with a casino full of smoke and other aggravations. Expensive, long line, nowhere to sit and eat in the place itself, even at odd hours of the morning. Enjoy sitting in the dark food court away from the place itself. The fries were pretty bad, too, somehow stale even with as busy as it was.\n",
      "Wow! I had always wanted to try these burgers since watching Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle a number of years ago. They did not disappoint. These sliders are so different than any Burger I have had before. The service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long. Can't wait to go back for more.\n",
      "I don't know what happened, but I recall drinking heavily and then waking up the next morning with a big box of white castle burgers. Now I have never had white castle but I saw these little guys off of the Harold and Kumar movie so I knew I'd like to try them some day. I didn't know that I would have them off of a drunken stupor, and I'm glad I did, because hung over me was very appreciative of these little guys. I would like to try to eat here again in passing, without any alcoholic influence, so who knows maybe one day I will!\n",
      "One of the trifecta of burger establishments and on my list it is number 3. The location jams this eatery between to other stores and makes it hard to find if not for the giant castle on the front. This is definitely a drunk food choice. Nothing better than downing as much as you can late at night when most other places are closed. A great place to experience. But maybe only experience once.\n",
      "Came here after some cocktails in the club. While it hit the spot, it took forever to order I will say this - it tasted better than the one I went to in New York City - but I think it is official - there is no reason for White Castle to be as popular as it is, except that perhaps people who love it do not know S*** about food lol.\n",
      "My experience here was not how I envisioned it. I envisioned my experience at White Castle the same as Harold and Kumar, enjoying endless sliders in absolute joy, basically having the best meal of my young life. Unfortunately that does not hold true and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more. The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied. I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy. The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried. They taste just like onion rings and are not anything too special at all. I wouldn't mind coming back to White Castle if it somehow it magically ended up in the Bay Area, but if I'm in Vegas again, I would definitely waste my money on something actually worth spending on.\n",
      "Thankful the 'belly bombers' are now on Vegas. I was raised on White Castle ;) nothing beats those grilled onions! I usually order a dozen with cheese and a dozen without. Recently tried the fudge dipped brownie!\n",
      "White Castle! I grew up in the midwest and used to eat this sliders all the time! Since I heard they opened up in Vegas, I was determined to come here again. Same great taste as I remembered, but the prices in Vegas were a lot higher. Inflation right? Ordered some sliders at night and a crave case to go! It's amazing you either love white castle or hate it. I love it!i\n",
      "First time eating at White Castle. We've all seen the movie....so I was stoked to finally check this off the bucket list. I was, unfortunately, disappointed. My issue lies not with the staff or cleanliness of the restaurant....even the prices were not bad. It's the food! The sliders taste EXACTLY like the frozen ones sold in your local grocer's freezer. If I did the Pepsi challenge with a frozen slider and one from the restaurant....I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Skip it.\n",
      "White Castle is okay. I ordered the two chicken burgers meal and my friend ordered the two cheeseburgers meal. I also got ranch and honey mustard as a side and that was a good call on my part as the chicken burgers were kind of dry. The cheeseburgers tasted just like the frozen ones. The fries were okay. Basically, everything was just okay. Cheap late night drunk food. But I would go to Earls any day over White Castle.\n",
      "White Castle finally came to the west coast, but it's certainly not the best on our coast. Everyone is curious about White Castle and what they have to offer. All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right? Well... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast. It definitely is worth the experience, but not much more than that to me.\n",
      "It has been about 20 years since going after Cubs games. Now they are in LasVegas on the strip. So walked over during lunch ordered a number 1 4 original sliders fries and a med drink. Yep it was delicious.\n",
      "Yummie drunk folks food! I got a 4 pc cheeseburger combo and added a slider. It was served fresh and hot! I really enjoyed my meal here with a tingly refreshing cherry coke. It was pretty busy but the line moved quickly!\n",
      "Don't know what the big deal is. Meat in the burger thin and small. Tastes ok for me. Given the hype when it was opened expected something better.\n",
      "Pretty alright place they have! Very confusing location. Got two crave cases & some chicken rings (or something idk they had chicken onion ring shaped patties) I thought I'd have to wait hours in line. When I walked it I was immediately helped. In & out within 4 minutes! The staff seemed a little rushed but I give them credit. It got way busy after I left. The chicken sandwiches I got were so good. I am certainly going back for more very soon! Thank you White Castle. You guys did a good job!\n",
      "The worst burger place I've ever been to. All the burgers have NO sauce. The cashier, Savana, a SUPERVISOR by the way, almost bit my nose off when I ordered. Ronesha, the girl who calls the orders, looked like she drunk a bottle of vinegar. No smile, no thank you, no enjoy your meal, nothing, only bitchy face. I have to say that the security and the cleaning people were SUPERfriendly. In other words, a big NO NO.\n",
      "The smallest Burger I ever have. It looks cute, but taste was below average, but it only cost 1.29, what can I complain, pay what u get.\n",
      "D. Freakin'. Licious. Best drunk food ever. My husband and I stayed at the Venetian and we ate here 3-4 times (we weren't drunk each time lol) during our 2 night 3 day stay. I'm not proud to admit that. Only qualm is that the line one time was ridiculously long and they only had one register. But what made up for it was the customer service. John, the cashier, was super nice. FYI they do offer military discounts.\n",
      "First time eating legit White Castle burgers and it didn't disappoint. Them sliders can be filling (I had 4 of them and i was full)...best part is, they are open 24/7!!! Now that's convenient!! So your missing out if you haven't had White Castle.\n",
      "I believe White Castle is slightly over-rated based on the movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.\" Although I do have to say it's a lot better than McDonalds. The food is cheap and the service is quick. The staff at this White Castle had a great attitude and we're very friendly. This was my first experience at White Castle. I ordered a breakfast slider which was egg and cheese and your choice of meat. Although I did enjoy my meal it didn't live up to my expectation. Everyone should try White Castle at least once in my opinion. So if you happen to pass it I do recommend stopping for at least one of their sliders. It's worth the experience.\n",
      "My review in one word... YUCK! I was so excited to try these little sliders, so my husband, our friend and I decided to go and we ordered their 20 slider combo. My husband is a picky eater so we ordered 15 with everything and 5 without onions or pickles. After waiting like 15 minutes for our order of course all 20 sliders had onions and pickles, so we had to order 5 more. Like I said... Yuck!! We were hungry as hello so I ended up eating 5, our friend 7 and my husband 4, we threw the rest away!! :( I guess these are popular in the East Coast because they don't have In-n-Out!!\n",
      "White Castle in Vegas on the strip next to Harrah's ok it's an ok place I'm not a big fan of White Castle but when you're hungry it tastes better lol. it's a small area but they are pretty fast. not much places to sit down especially when crowded. Prices are pretty high too but what do you expect for Las Vegas and on the Strip where they raise prices up. I think once to experience was good enough for me I'll stick to Lobster Me or D'Amores Pizza in PH or Secret Pizza in Cosmo for a fast lunch.\n",
      "This place is more hype than anything. I got one of each of the burgers and they were all disappointing. Same as the microwaveable crap you buy at the grocery store minus the long ass line. Save your money and time, go to a grocery store, or skip it entirely and get yourself a habit burger, hell, even McDonald's taste better than these tiny crap burgers. Two stars because I did like the loaded fries. PS I was not drunk, had I been, I'd probably think they were the best damn burgers in town.\n",
      "I was super excited to see a White Castle in Las Vegas. Food was hot and made exactly how I ordered. *I wish you had the sack of fries like other locations have. They had enough employees to handle the crowd of customers.\n",
      "Well well well i realize its opening day and it went pretty well for a 2 1/2 hour wait in line and 33 mins to get our food.... All was hood except the smokers who didnt care and at the very end of what could have been at least 4 stars... Riley at the door was belligerent to me when i came back in to get my daughter who was waiting on the food.... Too bad with the prices SO high, the novelty is a 80 cent burger they are 1.59 with cheese. Really guys? You wont make enough? This is a great way to run off your locals, trust me, youll regret it!\n",
      "Great experience!! The burgers were DELICIOUS! The customer service was fantastic and the staff was extremely friendly! I will definitely be back!! So excited that this restaurant finally moved to the west coast!\n",
      "The service was pretty quick. We ordered the 20 pack with 2 fries. The bottom buns were soggy----otherwise, the burgers were pretty good. Would come again if in the area.\n",
      "Grew up in Chicago and always loved sliders! This is more of a white castle \"light\" location meaning, they have a limited menu. However, for me the double cheeseburgers were awesome! They nailed it! Onion chips (think cut up rings) were very good as well. Negatives were the smaller menu (would love some jalapeno burgers), location is not the best, gets a bit crowded/long lines, over priced for sure, and the fries, meh, still not very good. Still, living in Phoenix now, I am thrilled I can get great sliders without having to fly back to Chi-town - I would definitely hit this place every time I was in town.\n"

      "had never been... not worth the walk! it was a fun experience since it's one of those places made famous by the movies, but not something I could imagine ever craving.\n",
      "Went today around 3:30 and was only in line for about 30 min. The employees were so nice, and didn't seem stressed at all considering the craziness they've gone through these past few days. They taste just like NY, brings back a lot of memories. The only downfall is the price, they range from $1.10-$1.50 each. NY is like half the price.\n",
      "Typical franchise location that created a ton of hype only to disappoint with frozen disgusting meat and a dirty and extremely crowded dining room. The meat was just more like a thinly slice of roast beef that lacks flavor.\n",
      "After walking up and down the Strip twice I was craving some White Castle almost as much as Roldy and Kumar! From the outside it looked like a tiny standalone but actually the location is inside the Casino Royale. Got the #7 Castle Pack, which was 10 sliders, two regular fries and two drinks. Service was good as they got my order out quickly in spite of the place being packed but for my first time eating White Castle burgers at a White Castle I was rather disappointed. These certainly did not hit the spot! I know sliders don't have much meat but these were practically meatless! And the onions could've tasted a whole lot better. The Fries were meh too as they were a bit soggy. Not gonna lie, I enjoyed the microwave White Castle burgers you get from the grocery better...\n",
      "Being from the East Coast and now living on the Left Coast, there are some foods I just can't get. This being one of them. Prices seemed a big higher than usual, probably the Vegas tax The service was quick and the food just as I remembered. First time I've seen one of those fill up beer from the bottom machines, pretty interesting. I'm good with White Castle for at least another year!\n",
      "Just like the ones in Michigan. Steamed onions, patties and buns. Must get the ketchup mustard mix.\n",
      "Kids liked their White Castle experience taste just like the frozen ones. Try adding the new jalapeño cheese really good especially on the fish burgers. Long lines but employees are very friendly and efficient.\n",
      "White Castle on the west coast? HELL YES... My Harold and Kumar dreams have come true! Located across from The Mirage, between Casino Royale and The Venetian. Now expectations wise don't be amazed. Yeah it's good. Pay $1.39 for a 2 bite burger isn't exactly the bang for buck but it's unique and it has a history..and a movie after it! Make sure you get cheese. My east coast fam flamed me for ordering a crave case (30) pack of original.. so don't make the same mistake. Quite frankly it adds up to $15 or so bucks to get decently satisfied if you're a moderate eater. It'll hold up in Vegas fine. Quick service, surprisingly nice workers and decent burgers. So go get wasted or high or both , have an epic journey throughout the Vegas strip, stop by here and earn your H&K moment.\n",
      "It's... fine. I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but this has been a questionable item on my bucket list since the first Harold and Kumar movie. Being a west coast girl, this was adventurous fast food cuisine for me. Turns out the hamburgers taste pretty much exactly like the microwaved versions you buy in the grocery store. The chicken rings taste a bit like breaded shoe leather, definitely don't bother ordering those. There can be a a significant wait to get your order, and the dining area is suffused with a quiet, desperate sadness, so if there are no available tables, go get (a lot) of drinks elsewhere and try again later.\n",
      "Thank you White Castle for coming to the WEST COAST.... As soon as they opened in Las Vegas, I was there that week. Can you bring one to CALI please, if not will travel for food.\n",
      "TBH I only wanted to try this place out because of Harold & Kumar. Lol Since they opened this location in Vegas, I decided to try this place out. Location: This place is located on the strip near the Palazzo Hotel and right next to Walgreens. It's right across the street from The Mirage and Treasure Island. Parking: You're gonna have to park at a nearby hotel and walk over if you aren't already staying at them because it is located directly on the strip. Menu: Pretty straight forward. Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?! Lol You can also buy meal packages, sets of 30, 100 lol Boyfriend and I opted for 10 cheese sliders and 5 original to compare and we heard they were small. ** TIP- You will not like these sliders if you do not like onions. I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. Lol I had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes. This place would definitely be great drunk food lol but it's not amazing but it's not bad either! I just can't see myself craving it all the time. Check this place out at least once so you can say you tried it!\n",
      "After all those days of feasting on frozen white castle burgers... I finally tried it for real... and the disappointment was real... My friend and I were ambition as hell and ordered the 30-pack of cheeseburgers.... after our lunch which was no more than 2 hours prior. That was about 2250 calories for each of us... (A package of 2 frozen ones is like 300 calories). We took our first bites and continued to much due to excitement... but the flavor sunk in. Wait, scratch that, what flavor? Compared to their frozen counterparts, these lacked salt, umami, msg, etc etc. Not satisfying at all... we left defeated.\n",
      "I dont get it....sorry. Tasteless little nuggets of some kinda meat, and fries that are no better than Del Taco. Service was friendly and quick and she asked if I were a local (which I am) so she gave me a little discount. Not sure what the appeal is but I'd pass on by next time. Even in a drunken hunger this place didn't satisfy.\n",
      "It's just okay. Neither good nor bad. I wasn't expecting much coming here but it was worth a try. Lines can be long but once you order the food it comes out pretty fast. The sliders were nothing to rave about... Super simple- patty, pickles (gross) & onions. My favorite thing here were probably the onion chips. (Similar to onion rings but smaller pieces) Their chicken rings reminds me of Burger King's chicken fries. I'd honestly need at least 3 or 4 sliders to fill up. The menu only shows the combo prices. Sliders are $1.59 each. If you want something different than your usual fast food joint then this place may be it. I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here. MEHHH.\n",
      "Great first time and I'm digging the sliders so hard. I've wanted to try White Castle for a while but I'm unsure of where one is in my area. Finally got my chance to and I don't regret it. The prices of the sliders were delightful and affordable. Quality isn't top notch but I feel like it's more enjoyable than a McDonald's burger. And it simply melts in your mouth, it was great, I didn't know that a slider could run like gold down your throat. I was also really big on the free onion ring slices that came with the sliders. That was amazing! I didn't even ask for that and there they were! I think that's a thing? Am I wrong? Or did the server just love me that much? I'd like to think it's both. Yeah probably both. While I loved the flavor of what I ate, White Castle is definitely more of a late night snack than a stomach bloating meal. For me at least. But I loved it none the less.\n",
      "Good burgers for a reasonable price... Eat here to save money while on the strip!\n",
      "Okay, so this place is more like 3.75 stars but whatever. I'm gonna give them a four despite hearing all of Yelp scorning me on my check-in ( :P ). Hey, we don't have a White Castle in Arizona and I have wanted to try an actual White Castle forever. Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up. Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven. It could also be because I was under-dressed for the surprisingly cold Vegas weather but the warmth of a cheese slider was bliss. I loved every dang bite and I don't care what y'all say. We ordered a 10-slider, fries, onion rings, and two drinks combo. We got five regular hamburgers and five cheeseburgers just to see the difference. I was trying to tell Mike W. that cheese makes everything better but he didn't listen and I ended up having to choke down some plain burgers while he enjoyed my delicious cheeseburgers. The fries were meh but those onion rings were pretty legit. All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick cheap bite when I'm on The Strip. Is it the best burger ever? Haha, of course not. This is a fast food place, obvi. But I definitely wouldn't say no to going over to White Castle for a quick bite!\n",
      "There isn't a White Castle in the DC metro area, so I definitely had to visit when I was in Vegas. The sliders didn't look appetizing but tasted decent. This is definitely an establishment to visit after having a long night at the bars. Next time, I'll take advantage of the close proximity of In N Out instead. At least they have top quality burgers for a better price.\n",
      "White Castle!!!! I was so excited to see that a White Castle had opened up in Vegas. I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar. I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle. I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay. It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status. I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before. It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale. We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away. The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly. Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get. We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices. Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside. We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food. The people working there are really nice and good natured. They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality. I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers. It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas. Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon. Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good. Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns. I got full after eating about 4 of them. The first one I ate, I thought was really good. The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly. I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles. I thoroughly enjoyed my first one. By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less. If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like. They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better. The onion chips were really good. I would definately recommend that if you like onions. The breading is crunchy and thick. We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club. Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard. I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations. If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot. It is open 24 hours anyways. I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient.\n",
      "Been wanting to try this place since everyone keeps talking about it. Came on the day of Christmas and it was packed but we managed to get a table and came before the rush. Ordered the fish slider, chicken slider, and the regular beef slider. The sliders were good but the portion were so tiny compared to photos..I enjoyed it but it was gone before I knew it..took like 3 bites and it's gone. I wish the patty was slightly bigger, it was quite thin I almost missed it. The fish slider was delicious and super soft. The chicken slider was probably best out of all 3 for me. Please increase your portion!\n",
      "They are considered a east coast institution but they tasted like McDonalds Cheeseburgers to me. I think its the combination of pickles and onions and thin meat on a soft bun. Would I try again, why not but I wouldn't expect outstanding at all. Onion strips were okay. Staff was polite and kind and had me on my way with combo #2 in no time (4 cheeseburgers, onions or fries plus drink). Place is located on the east wall of the Casino Royale which I think they took some space from a Denny's that use to be there or might still be there. Security is there to keep people from cutting a very long line. My experience was walking in and was asked by a guard if I just got there, I said yes and then he asked me to get in line but there was no long line, I asked him which line? He then said oh, another guard just said go ahead sir. Line was actually 5 deep at the time and not out the door to the strip like some mentioned.\n",
      "Charlton & the gang go to White Castle! Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty! Las Vegas is known for housing popular \"guilty pleasure\" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino. This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier). Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done. I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle. I am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine. CC out!\n",
      "I've been to Krystal burger several times, so was excited to finally be able to compare them to White Castle (never having the opportunity to try White Castle except for frozen version). I think it hits the spot if you're drunk. And the buns are more fluffy than their frozen counterparts when fresh. So overall it's worth a go to see what Harold and Kumar were all about. Like it or hate it, it's cool that it exists on the west coast now.\n",
      "So to start off I'm not a burger fanatic i rarely eat them and if I do its a couple of bites from my son or BF. What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol. We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink. The chicken sliders were good it reminded me burger kinds chicken fries. The other stuff we ordered on the side was onion chips theyre like onion rings but turned into bite size pieces of goodness. We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy. Above all I would come bk the lines are long but once you order your food comes out pretty fast. They have an assembly line going on in front of you so you can see what theyre doing to your food. The best part is it's open 24 hours 7 days a week. The location is in between Venetian and Harrahs inside the Casino Royale. Oh yeah they also serve beer for all you beer lovers :-)\n",
      "First time ever at a White Castle. Had to see what all the hype was about. Quick fast food. Tasty little sliders especially after a night of Vegas drinking.\n",
      "Harold & Kumar does not justify White Castle. the hype is ridiculous. Or Vegas White Castle is not as tasteful as expected. What an unfortunate turn of events. At least we gave it a shot. if you want what I encountered at White Castle then head to your nearest grocery store & purchase the frozen pack. That's all.\n",
      "It's OK. Nothing special. But I would get the novelty of this place because it was on the movie \"Harold and Kumar\" Lol. Burgers are $1.99 and 4 pack combos are around $7.99 not bad. For a quick late night snack it's definitely a good place to go if nothing is open.\n",
      "I'd say this is a good experience for those who've heard the legend of White Castle (much like how East Coasters need to try In N Out, us West Coasters need to try White Castle) and only have tasted the retail supermarket frozen freezer version of these mini silders. I was actually fairly excited at the prospect of trying the White Castle Burger. They sell them individually and they're over $1 each. If you look at the special \"dollar menu\" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho. It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star). So, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago. Beyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet/Swanson's frozen dinner \"Salisbury steak\" or sliced meatloaf. It's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size. The french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions. I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases. Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside). I rate this * * * three stars, \"A OKAY\" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my \"must go to\" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars. This location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel.\n",
      "The food is addicting. The little burgers are cute and perfect for the little ones and as for my son awesome for all his food challenges. Every time we are in Vegas we have to stop by white castle. . Decent price . The only down fall is the parking area is not accessible. The other down fall is there is never a place to sit so the kids wait for a place to open to save seats while we order.\n",
      "Waited in line for about an hour and a half but it was worth it. We ordered 20 burgers added cheese to half of them and it came with 2 Fries. Also added a 6 pc chicken rings and soda and total came out to $37! The fries were nothing special and I won't get them again and the chicken rings were alright. Nothing special either. Burgers of course were delicious and we took half of them home and warmed the rest up for dinner. Only complaint is the prices!! They should be charging the same that they do at all there east coast locations not jacking the price up cause it's on the strip. Hope they get the jalapeño burgers soon cause those are the best! I also like to say it cracks me up how people Compare this to in n out!!! There is no comparison what so ever so stop comparing. There's actually not a single fast food or burger joint U can compare to White Castle.\n",
      "do not eat if your diet lately has been healthy. your stomach gonna hurt real bad. other then that classic drunk food. mini burgers fries and a cherry coke.\n",
      "Wanted to try this place since forever, there wasn't much of a line and the orders came out quick, my daughter is a chicken nugget queen so we got lucky and ordered the chicken rings which were small so you gotta order the 9 piece. We tried both the cheese sliders and original, I think without cheese they have a better flavor. Love it!\n",
      "Had to try it! I was more about the experience than the food I think! paper thin burgers with 5 holes in the middle. Great Mustard Fries were good Very long line, Friday nigh about 40 minutes in line and no lots of seating.\n",
      "OMG! There is a White Castle now in Vegas!?!? Why?? Guess it's for the dudes that did not score... I grew up in the East Coast surrounded by White Castle's. Basically it's a gross hamburger that ONLY tastes great when it is between 2 AM and 5 AM and you meet ALL THREE of the following conditions: 1. Your are drunk, and 2. You are very hungry, and 3. You did not score at the club. My friends and I would come to White Castle in HIGH SCHOOL after a night of cruising, boozing (fyi: drinking age was 18 back East--16 if you looked older and cool), schmoozing, and losing. At 2 AM all night long the place is filled with dudes that have no squeeze box--otherwise they would not be here--you have loser spelled all over you when you step foot in the door. But after a few White Castles at 25 cents each, 30 cents with cheese it was, and some greasy ass fries--you don't worry about it till the next morning when you wake up alone with Hamburger breath. Not a place for children, not for the sober, not for anyone looking for a quality hamburger, not a place you take a significant other or any woman unless you want to get dumped fast. I still have vivid memories of the those days back at WC. If I could only go back in time, I would not have needed to make as many trips there with the boys.\n",
      "Been eating white castle since I lived in chitown, they're a little pricy, but there def worth the wait.....HEY its Vegas so expect to pay more...\n",
      "Next time you see the line and ask yourself \"is it worth it?\" ANSWER- NO!!!!! Great food.. Terrible service. I get that it's a Friday night and you are understaff but to treat your customers with disrespect and roll your eyes when you serve them their food is just degrading. It's not that hard to make 20 sliders for someone. Especially after you already made 20+ for someone who ordered after. \"Here's your order (as she slaps the bag on the counter)\" -staff Just rude. Ps. 40 min after we orders Been there, done that, never going to do it (in vegas) again.\n",
      "Not sure how you managed to screw up a Chicago institution... but you did. I have been going to white castle since I was little in Chicago. Cheap, hot, tasty little meat treats. The highlight was the warm juicy onions against that little crunch of pickle. The location in vegas has just missed the boat. They were tastless, over salted and soggy. I was so ticked I went to the manager and said these are not white castles. He asked me where I was from, told him, he laughed and said me too, then he went back there and made me some himself. Those tasted right. Ultimatly I think it is the fact that you have non-chicagoans trying to make vintage Chicago food. It would be like having a blind guy pick your wardrobe... he can get close because someone told him about the colors but never dead on because having never experiance them, he doesn't really know what the colors are. (No that's not a dig on blind people). Same deal here...\n",
      "Honetly I came here at 3 in the morning (its a 24 hour location) and the line was ridiculous. Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting. It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad. On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.\n",
      "Great place for a late night snack after a party hardy night on the Strip. Space is a bit cramped but food is up to par. Service was fairly quick, got our \"Sack\" of 10 sliders within 10 minutes.\n",
      "I finally got my white castle burgers and the wait was worth. Would have given 5 starts but the fries were not good. So So good. Wish I would have gotten 6 instead of 4.\n",
      "DEAR Las Vegas, White Castle is the bomb. YES you need to be drunk. YES you want to get them \"extra steamed\". And ask management... Where is the dusseldorf and big red?????? What is a slider? A SMALL DAMN BURGER! PS. White castle is the 1st ever burger shop. It has been around since 1921. PPS. If the only reason you are coming here is because of Harold and Kumar, GO HOME. That's like only enjoying Friends in Low Places at a Garth Brook concert.\n",
      "Heard the menu selection in Chicago is bigger and offers Jalepeno burger. Burgers are not very much different from the Frozen White Castle in your local stores.\n",
      "We parked at Venetian and walked over. Found out there was a White Castle in Vegas and had to go. We stopped by after a show at the Mandalay at around 1am. Great place to go for a late late night snack....if you're wasted. This is totally drunk food. Don't come here if you're sober. The meat was thin and flavorless. It resembled Spam. Service was super quick though. Fries were the best part of the meal. I would love to try White Castle again...but not in Vegas.\n",
      "Oh White Castle! Even though I never watched the Harold and Kumar movie before, I have heard about the sliders from White Castle and I couldn't wait to try one. Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift! When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip. I can't say I won't ever be back, but probably not in the near future.\n",
      "I've only heard of the wonders that are White Castle sliders. As a CA native, WC is a thing of movies and the frozen aisle at Walmart, but I needed to try the real thing. The line was short on a Sunday at 11am and my double cheese slider was ready in less than 5 minutes. IT WAS ALL I EVER HOPED AND DREAMED OF. The onion content is a bit heavier than I'd have chosen, but I'll know that for next time. Hot, moist, delicious, and satisfying. Why aren't these available closer to home?\n",
      "Yay. First time trying and I was not disappointed. SIMPLE Cheeseburgers & Cheap! Extra grilled onions Liked the open kitchen layout. Super Clean! Friendly staff.\n",
      "Are you in Las Vegas in the north part of the strip, drunk, hungry, wandering around, already took off your heels and have flat/slippers/or just nastily barefoot? White Castle is there for you! I mean, it is what it is! If you think chicken nuggets are unnaturally shaped, get on some chicken RINGS! I cannot differentiate between regular White Castle burgers from the brick & mortar and the frozen ones. It's like they might as well have a bunch of microwaves to warm up the frozen mutant meat--no one is going to notice or care. Chicken Rings, wtf? Yes.\n",
      "It was husbands pick. Heard about the lines on opening day so I was worried that it might be crowded but alas it was not at all and I can see why. It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip. You can see and hear slots in the dining room. I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then. I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference. UM, no. They were pretty awful. Patty is thin as paper with no flavor. Bread is soft and soggy. Price was also a lot for the quality you get. $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip. Even my husband was not crazy about them either. It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back. I just don't get the fascination? Give me In and Out Burger anyday. Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King. They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem. The whole thing was so bland. Would be good for kids.\n",
      "Food is whack....don't know what Harold and Kumar were craving...don't this crap here...In-N-Out rules here...\n",
      "I love how all of these east coast classics are making their way to Las Vegas! I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination. White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes. We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes. Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird. Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like! Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special. Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste. After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu. Oh yeah, White Castle is open 24/7 to satisfy your after party munchies.\n",
      "So who was the wise guy that thought a whopping two registers was going to cut it? There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward. O T H E R W I S E... Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders? Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there - portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all. I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try. We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know. I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place. RIP stomach.\n",
      "This was just freaking gros in my opinion, a couple of my friends liked it, for me the smell alone was enough for me to hurl. But as a foodie groupie such as myself lol, i don't let smell detour me its unfair. First off this place is constantly packed, fast service though. Price is a tad below average which is a small plus seeing its located on the strip. You might notice that the place is a dump in the inside, understandbly so many people. As for the burgers/sliders they were tiny and light and also tasteless nothing to write about but an after taste that stays in your mouth tasting like old onion. I went to use their toilets after waiting in line for 5 minutes, just as disgusting , it looks like the burgers rushed out of people's systems in a hurry. Save some gambling money eat somewhere better, this place is for the those in desperation to eat cheap.\n",
      "The food was okay. The burgers were a little thin for me and needed some flavor-- I would get them with cheese, next time. But, I would give whom I think is the manager (we were there around 12 noon on June 1, 2015) the extra star for his skills, he was working hard along side his workers, kept his cool with his employees, and I don't know how he does it, but he even ran up to the front to call a customer back to ask if they needed condiments because he noticed that his employee forgot to ask them if they needed some.\n",
      "Stopped off for these little tasty treats on the way to checking into our hotel. They were melt in your mouth delicious! Better eaten fresh and not cold. It's a definite must stop in whenever in vegas\n",
      "Ugh... I'm being generous with that third star... but whatever. I grew up on microwaved White Castles... and my first time having them in person... they're honestly not bad. Better than the microwave version, but not by much. That pickle they put on there is just right for the flavor. They're nothing special though. What gets me is that they're pretty pricey for what they are... I wouldn't seek them out again, but, if I was walking the strip and had the munchies while walking by, I'd certainly grab em.\n",
      "Tastes just like the Midwest classic! Lots of seating and it's open all night! Definitely will hit the spot!\n",
      "Thank heavens this has finally landed upon the Las Vegas strip (at least until it happens to finally be bestowed upon California) is all I can say! Well ok maybe not everything.....I will admit at first it was a bit difficult to find (was across the street pretty much from Mirage and tucked inside the craziness that is the Harrah's portion of the strip), but once I did it brought me back to the days of my youth in Minnesota and damned if nostalgia didn't make this meal taste that much better..Oh yeah and I'm talking about the REAL White Castle and not the supermarket abomination! So I just kept it simple and got a bag of sliders with cheese (no condiments needed at that's a bold statement from this guy). It was just as I remembered from the taste to the smile at the end. They are small in nature, but I don't feel like a fatty if I pound out 5 of them! I did like the fact they are put in paper containers now and the pickle in the middle gives it that perfect hint of umph when partnered with the tender meat and gooey cheese..Just thinking of the slider salivates the mouth indeed! I did take notice that the line does get a bit lengthy, but doesn't that tell you your taste in food is better than most? I thought the staff managed to kill the line pretty fast so for me waiting wasn't a complaint at all. I also found that they treat you with respect if you give it back so my experience was just as I remembered it. All in all, I will be back again and this time I just might bust for the 100 slider snack pack..Signed, sealed, and delivered their mine!\n",
      "I gave into the hype. I just had to, even though reviews weren't great. Well, shocker, White Castle wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Burgers are basic but just really taste like bread. Fries were plain jane. No ranch dressing available to dip any of this in to make it better! Now I can say I've been to White Castle, an I definitely don't have to go again!\n",
      "Being a California guy I've always wanted to try White Castle (yes cause of Harold and Kumar) these burgers are crap, nothing special about them, fries were barely decent\n",
      "I Love White Castle burgers I waited 45 min because they just open in Vegas and I had 6 of them and they brought back memories back from my New York days.\n",
      "Three stars here because I love White Castle but not at the prices that exist at this location. I grew up in Ohio so White Castle was always around. It was a very cheap and fast way. Here in Vegas however, prices are doubled which quickly makes this place not worth going to. I love White Castle but not $10+ much.\n",
      "Must be a nostalgia thing. The wife always wanted to try one as she had family who loved these. Neither one of us can figure what the draw is. Not real burger tasting or anything to make it stand out. If you just want to say you had one then give it a go, at least it's not real pricey.\n",
      "Hell yes! That's all I said when I Jumped in line, growing up with a New Yorker in the house you learn a thing or two about the east, one thing I leave was WC! Growing up he always said the freezer boxes weren't the same.. I didn't understand till my first time in his hometown, the greatest experience ever! Came to Vegas for my Bday and relieved a Childhood memory of a deprived west coast child, bitter sweet coming without pops but I know he's looking down smiling because I ordered the same way he used to! The service was Great! The line was Short the fries fell short on taste but that's expected they aren't known for the fries not bad but not amazing.. The employees were great! Very involved! Over all a great experience this will be a go to spot for me every time I come to Vegas!\n",
      "White Castle in NY is the best. When I visit that place is a must eat, a few times during visit we buy by the case. Well I live in henderson for 8 years. They were in silverton casino for the food truck fair. I waited in line for over an hour. They were worth waiting for. Cost 1.00 each. Today I went to the strip to get some. Very disappointed. The burgers were over cooked, no ketchup , no salt and the roll was like it was sitting unwrapped for hours. Dry and firm.Like a hamburger roll gets when left in sun. In NY you are able to watch them make them. Seems like they are not making them the same way. Corporate needs to bring out someone to train them and I don't mean a manager. There was a lady in NY that was there for over 20 years. Food could be good but the chef has to cook it good.......\n",
      "WOW! So disappointing. Perhaps I was all about that Harold and Kumar hype but really...? Why did they travel far af to get these soggy ass sliders? Don't expect anything fabulous at White Castle. Pretty disappointing. It was rather expensive for 4 sliders & fries. The bun was really airy, could have been a good or bad thing depending on how you like dem buns. The patty was a sliver. Pretty sad. The meal itself served its purpose of helping me hold my alcohol for the night soooo... 2 stars.\n",
      "So, once I found out they opened a White Castle in Vegas, I knew I had to try it on my upcoming trip. On our last night there, we took the Deuce down to Casino Royale (between Harrah's and the Venetian) to see what all the hype was all about. I had heard the lines could get crazy, but luckily it was only minimally busy (Tuesday night) and the wait was short. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the hamburger. :( My sister-in-law tried the Chicken Ring burger and liked it, so I may consider trying that next time... I'm glad I tried it, but not sure if I would go again.\n",
      "First off, it's definitely not worth the 2 + hour wait. Wait like a month or so to go when the hype is over. My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't. After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering. I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was. Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad.\n",
      "2 stars cause the guy cleaning tables was quick and very friendly. Otherwise... This doesn't really taste like white castles from back home. Way soggy.\n",
      "Eh...not impressed and not worth the hype. Very little meat (almost paper thin), fries were dry, and more like ore ida frozen fries. Just really not impressed.\n",
      "Late night munchies! Line was long and the security guards act like they're PD.... it's a white castle for God's sake... ! Oh yeah...get ready for some mean gas! Fart game food. Most definitely a good time to play the fart game after eating at this place. Are the sliders on the east coast soggy because this place had the soggiest of the soggy. Not a big fan. The microwave white castle burgers were way better and didn't give me the farts.\n",
      "I hated it ! I'm from Chicago and I was excited about the idea more than the food. Onion chips WTF n was cold had to send back . Save the calories !! :-(\n",
      "I'm from New York where we could get these any time. When I moved here 15 years ago, I called corporate and inquired about opening a franchise out here. No go, All stores are corporate owned. Bought the boxed frozen White Castle's from Smiths for years. Finally was so excited they opened a store out here. Finally made time to go and check it out. Really? The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible! And in NY they never had pickles on them, where did that come from? In NY we jokingly called them belly bombs, out here they truly are! My stomach hurt for 2 days after eating this crap. I am truly disappointed here and will NEVER go back to this store. The boxed ones at Smiths are WAY better and closer to the real thing you get in NY.\n",
      "My boyfriend & I have been waiting since our last Vegas trip for this to open! Finally, a White Castle for us to try that is not frozen! We ordered: #7 - 10 original sliders (add cheese), 2 regular soft drinks, 2 regular French fries (one of them = cheese fries). It sounds like a lot, but for 2 really hungry people, it is a cake to finish because the sliders are small. Each slider comes with onions & pickles (I did not realize this until I took my first bite -__-) The food is good & it is a perfect drunk meal for when you are finished clubbing because it open 24/7! Fudge-dipped Cheesecake - Nothing extraordinary. Customer service could have been better. Several of us were looking at the menu & deciding & the cashiers kept on asking if we were ready. Also, considering how much food my boyfriend & I ordered, they only gave us 3 ketchups... My boyfriend went back to ask for more & the workers gave him 2, then I went back to ask for more & I got 3. Pretty shady!\n",
      "Was just as I remembered growing join the Midwest, but the bread was soggy and the prices were a lot hugger. In Michigan, the current price is $4.99 for the number one. Here it's $7.99. I know it's located on the strip, but I was sooooo looking forward to coming here for an affordable meal. Also, the employees could at least smile! A smile goes a very long way! Making someone feel welcomed will keep them going back. With that and the prices I won't be in a rush to come back before I leave Vegas.\n",
      "Having lived primarily on the west coast, I have never had the opportunity to go to a White Castle. So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range. So I think I'll just check this off my list of places to try and move along.\n",
      "I once waited an hour for a seventh course meal and it was still faster than this. Only reason I even attempted to wait this long is because I made myself believe that the bun was made of Egyptian papyrus scrolls and the meat was made of brontosaurus....\n",
      "I preferred not to give any star at all! Taste nasty. the burger was wet,soft and it's like worst burger I ever had. Burger King's burger is way better than this shit. I don't know this place is so popular.\n",
      "Not worth it. Go to in n out. Or any other burger joint if possible. The service was good but the food wasn't. Very bland, the pickle was the best part.\n",
      "At least, I can chalk this one off the list! What were Harold and Kumar thinking?!? I was just expecting GREATNESS! The sliders were made with a thin soft bun with a small hamburger patty. I'm kind of a lettuce, tomato, and pickle on my burger gal so I found them to be plain for my taste, but not bad. The fries were good. I'd only go back if a friend wanted to go.\n",
      "If I can give this place 0 starts I would !!!! It's the worst place I ever had in my life . I rather eat Burger King . The hype is honestly not worth it !!\n",
      "My first time ever trying White Castle was waaay back in high school straight from the frozen section. I finally got the real thing in Chicago and it was pretty damn good especially for the price. So how's this White Castle in Vegas? Nothing special sadly. There was just something missing. Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking. Where is the caramelized onion flavor white castle is known for? I thought an establishment that sold out within hours of its grand opening would present something better than cafeteria food.\n",
      "It's nice that we have a White Castle, but the price is too high for the quality of the experience. The onion crisps are very nice, though.\n",
      "I was tired and exhausted from two nights of clubbing. I spent Sunday afternoon in bed and sleeping on and off. I refused to leave the room. Then came my amazing friend with a bag full of White Castle goodies and a Serendipity float. I have the best friends in the world. I've never had White Castle before but holy moly it was PHENOMENAL. Maybe it's because I have a thing for tiny foods, but the grilled onions in these babies really make these sliders what they are. I wish I can say something about the wait or price, but I will do an update on this review when I can.\n",
      "Good luck finding a White Castle stand-alone restaurant anywhere in California or the West Coast. This White Castle is the closest one I know where I live, but I wouldn't make the drive solely for WC. If I'm going to Vegas, I'm gambling, going to different buffets, and having my fun while I'm out here! I've came here on two separate visits to enjoy WC burgers. Cooked fresh in front of me instead of buying the WC burgers in my local supermarket freezer or convenience store. I'd imagine this WC gets a ton of foot traffic and their employees getting paid well doing what they do. Do they deserve $15/hr? Hell no! Because of what I said, there will often be long lines which doesn't bother me much. The food is well worth the wait, and if you love their food wouldn't you mind waiting a little longer? They also don't serve burgers, nope. Veggie sliders, fish sliders, etc are also on their menu. I don't come here for anything but their burgers. I mean aren't they known for their burgers? I don't mind variety and options, but In N Out has done so well just serving burgers!\n",
      "This was on my list of food places I had to try when I visited Vegas. I've always been a fan of the frozen ones. I grew up eating those. When I finally visited on 12/17/16, I was sooooo disappointed. I came pretty late at night and there was a line of people. The line went by fast and I ordered the original slider, cheese slider, chicken ring slider, and the onion chips. Total came to under $20 I recall which is not bad. Food came out fast and I was ready to dig in. The sliders were about the same size as the frozen ones but it seemed a bit smaller, maybe that's just me. But as others have pointed out, these taste just like the store bought ones. Depending on you, this could be a good thing? Maybe you like the consistency? But like others, I was just expecting so much more!! I blame the hype surrounding White Castle. This place is too hyped up and I'm not sure how others could give it 3+ stars. Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna eat my frozen White Castle sliders. But don't bother going to the actual restaurant. You'll be disappointed! Onion chips are good tho...?? I guess\n",
      "Four words. Over priced and over hyped. Thumps down. I know your known for small burgers, but seriously guys 5 french fries for $3 dollars is ridiculous. ****Beware!! Patron here only if you are heavily intoxicated. (You will not enjoy these sober.)\n",
      "I've always wanted to try White Castle burgers made fresh from their actual restaurant. My experience with them to this point had been buying their frozen burgers they sell across the country in most grocery stores (which I really enjoy). I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip). Burgers were okay, fries were okayish, and prices were average. White Castle ended up being a luke warm purgatory like experience.\n",
      "I had biznass nearby, so I figured I might as well finally try to come here. Although it was a decent fast food option, I'm definitely glad I didn't make this place a destination on its own. $9 for a combo meal is overpriced IMO, but hey, it's on the strip, so I'm guessing the prices are a little inflated. I usually avoid this area like the plague, so I doubt I'll come again any time soon.\n",
      "I lived in Indiana for 9 years. I learned to appreciate White Castle from the locals. I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion. Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards, that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy. Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future. Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions. Yes, I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless. I'm glad I made the effort to seek out this White Castle experience. Service: 5 Star Service from a very busy crew.\n",
      "Been drinking and playing all day and night...quick you need food stat! White castle is that quick food you just may need. Get the grease to line your stomach and cure that hangover. While white castle isn't the best food in Vegas, it is cheap, quick and gets the job done. Good fast food and would visit this place again. The staff took my order, got my food and got me out the door, can't really ask for more.\n",
      "White Castle was on my list 'to try' when I was in Vegas. Though I was never a fan of the frozen White Castle sandwich I still wanted to try this one. The line was super long when we got there, and waited at least 30mins in line. We ordered two of the Cheese Sliders Combo, which came with 3 cheese sliders, fries and a drink. I wasnt really expecting too much thinking it will taste exactly like the frozen ones, but I thought they were pretty good! I wouldnt say that im obsess with it tho, lol. I would still recommend it if you're in Vegas just to say that you've tried it. Lol.\n",
      "1star is being generous !!!! Disgusting burger ... I got the 4 burger meal 3 of the 4 burgers did not have a pickle and the onions were not fresh the fries were not hot ---- yuk !! tables dirty - floors sticky - health dept needs to do an inspection\n",
      "I had high expectations for the famous White Castle this place was nothing great the soda even sucked burgers were freezer burned and the buns were so soggy the onions were disastrous this place is an abomination get your shit together White Castle you've failed us. NO STARS IF THERE WAS AN OPTION!!!! ITS NOT EVEN REAL MEAT ITS GREY COLORED WITH HOLES\n",
      "I really didn't think the sliders were that good here. It seems all hype and its so busy since it's usually on the East Coast and this is the closest location to me (I'm from CA). I don't know if it's worth coming here and looking for this if you're on the strip like we did... The sliders and chicken rings tasted microwaveable and the French fries tasted old and weren't crunchy. My friend also said it tasted just like the ones you can get at the store. The sliders are so small too and they only have a thin piece of meat, cheese, onions and a pickle--not what I was expecting. #2-- 4 cheese sliders, a small fry and a soft drink were not worth $9.27. Good thing I split it with a friend and we got more food after! I'm sorry White Castle... I'm not sure if I'll be back. :(\n",
      "Late night snacks? Definitely. I think ti was $4 for a double slider and loaded fries. Can't go wrong with either!\n",
      "Finally decided to try the White Castle on the strip. There sure is a lot of people standing around doing nothing on shift. There's about 20 employees behind the counter together yet maybe only five or so are actually working. No wonder the line is out the door, not because their busy but because they have employees standing around aimlessly chit chatting instead of working. Hmmmm a lot of unhappy customers in line.\n",
      "Finally people on the west coast get a White Castle Restaurant! For the tourists, it would be easiest to park at The Venetian and then walk south on the strip. I really liked the Cheeseburger sliders. The way its cooked makes it a little soft, but i really liked it. It's different from all the other fast food places here. The fries are nothing special (just not my thing) but they did have the bonus of reminding me of my childhood. My suggestion would be to get the loaded fries. Can't wait to go back and try more! I loved that they had Mell Yello!\n",
      "Got a crave case. Majority of the burgers were luke warm or half cold and thrown together sloppily. Time of day was around 3:30am and it wasn't crazy busy. Spent almost $50 and could have done way better with $15 at dell taco. The best part of this experience was the smoke drenched casino attached and the jameson filled Irish coffee you can get while waiting 30min to get inside. If you want White Castle go to the frozen food section at your local grocery store.\n",
      "My first time ever!! And it did not disappoint! We grabbed one of the large packs which included 20 sliders. They are small since they are sliders but they are yummy! Flavorful cheesy meaty goodness that melts in your mouth!\n",
      "White Castle. I'm from the east coast, so I've had WC before, and I was pretty excited they were opening on the strip. I found myself on the strip at 5:45 am, less than 16 hours after the grand opening and judging by the line I figured this may be my only shot to ever eat here. Even at 6 am it was pretty packed. I only ordered 2 sliders and onion chips and waited for my food. And waited for my food. And... See, the issue is, there's always going to be some yahoos getting a crave case or a crave crate (100) that is going to hold up the line. I also saw people getting their food before me that ordered after me, and my order was quite small. Pros: It tastes exactly like the White Castle you have grown to love. Cons: The price is a bit higher than your typical standalone WC. The wait is always going to be outrageous. The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Like, worse than Waffle House. If you've got the time, and you want some White Castle, have at it. I'm not sure I'll be back. Three *** - Only because I knew what I was getting into.\n",
      "White Castle is located inside Casino Royale. I wish it was sectioned off better. You can really smell the smoke when you are eating. It was nice to finally try White Castle, since there are none near me. The burgers are pretty small. I liked how the burger bun was really soft. We also ordered the fries, which are crinkle cut. Overall, there are a few tables inside for customers to enjoy their food. Its a good place to grab a quick snack.\n",
      "I ordered one of the combinations and let me start by saying that it was like the food was mush in small buns nasty. the sad part was I really excited to try their food!\n",
      "Our group bought the 30 pack for about 8 ppl and it was so damn delicious! Ate a couple before pre gaming and then ate the rest when we came back. I prefer it with cheese. Minus one star cuz the fries sucked.\n",
      "It was worth the experience to see what all the hype was about. 5 stars for service and burgers....1 star for the prices, although being on the strip I expected to pay more, It was a little much. The frozen ones from the grocery store are just as good:)\n",
      "Wow, this is the worst thing I have ever had. This is not a hamburger I'm not quite sure what this is but it's terrible. I would rather eat a jack in the box and that's not saying much. I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is good.\n",
      "We thought we would be waiting in line forever but they were quick and efficient! And they taste so damn good!! So glad there's a White Castle on the West Side! :)\n",
      "cool for us west coast people. came here late night 2 am and maybe 4am. place was pretty clean. food came out fast. no complaints here. minor issue of someone passed out and some goofballs trying to take pictures of the dude koed. yeah-burgers -onion rings ok-fries no-chicken rings fast, quick, easy done! the food is w.e but hey now ive been to white castle. me and harold we did it\n",
      "My friends and strangers alike were telling me, urging me, don't get my hopes up for White Castle. It's not worth it. But for me, it was worth it every one bit. I ordered one of every type of burger. The double burger with jalapeno cheese was my favorite--so melty, so soft, so delicious and perfect. I literally could have finished it in a bite. Burgers were not greasy one bit. We tried the onion chips as a side since they seemed to be the most unique. I could have done without them, but they were a nice accompaniment. I love watching the employees make the little burgers. So efficient and coordinated. It's gross looking at the raw little patties (I mean, who knows what's in that meat despite them emphasizing it's 100% beef) but still, it was delicious. I can imagine myself finishing an order of 30 burgers if I could... White Castle isn't In-n-out, my forever favorite, but every time I'm in Vegas, I'll be making a stop here.\n",
      "UGH!! Service is great but these burgers suck! Theyre over prices and taste like ass... I dont know what the hype is all about. You can catch me at IN N Out or even nasty McDonalds before eating one of these again! 3 stars is LITERALLY ONLY for the customer service\n",
      "Not impressed at all! Was looking forward to this Whitecastle as I had eaten the sliders from the frozen food aisle in the grocery store when I was a teenager. I guess it would be different if I grew up with them and it was nostalgic, but I didn't and they're just gross and $1.59 per slider with cheese... Ridiculous! Excellent customer service, though...nice people!\n",
      "Very good as I remember them growing up in Bronx N.Y . Have not had one in years. They need to put one in every state. These burgers are good when you have a lot of kids with you.\n",
      "That was probably the most disgusting burger I have ever had. I could only eat the fries. lol\n",
      "One word: overrated! This place is not even in the same ballpark as some of the great burger joints! Came here with high expectations due to: 1) Everyone ranting and raving about how great the burgers are 2) It's renowned reputation in the East Coast 3) they made a movie about how amazing it is! Always wanted to try it after watching Harold and Kumar so naturally when I had a chance to dig into a pack of these \"amazing burgers\" during my last trip to Vegas, how could I not??? Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers! My husband and I didn't get through our pack of burgers and ended up throwing them away knowing we weren't going to eat them later. Huge disappointment! :(\n",
      "The verdict is in......it's a 'Naah' for me. I had been wanting to check this place out after seeing it on a cooking channel about fast food burgers. My little itty bitty teenie weenie, did I mention teenie weenie, oh yea I did, super micro thin patty was a sight to behold if I could find the darn thing! I have never experienced a meat slider so tiny before. The flavor was very meh and it was just very lack luster. The onion finger thingy's were good, they tasted like a crispy onion ring. The fries were the average crinkle frozen fries so party there. Overall, I didn't like it enough to eat there again. On to the next spot!\n",
      "I finally got a chance to try out this place. I tried a little bit of everything. My favorite was the onion chips, but I'm a big fan of deep fried, battered onions. I liked the fish burger, but I wish they put sauce on it. The chicken breast burger was just OK but also needed some sauce & seasoning. Last, I got the cheeseburger. It was OK and had too much filler in it that it didn't taste like hamburger meat. Also, it was pretty bland. I liked the soft buns on everything, but it's not enough to bring me back. For tiny sandwiches, it ended being pretty pricey. Service was good.\n",
      "There are only two reasons to go here. And if you're here for any other reasons, then this place is nothing more than a 2 star. 1. You've seen harold and Kumar and they somehow brainwashed you to believe that this is the best burger ever. 2. You're fucked up and can't make any real logical decisions. All of my stars go to Harold and Kumar. The burger gets none. I am never coming back\n",
      "Mmmm White Castle...brings me back to my college days every time I visit one! I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little. This location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception. My favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks! They had a full staff working and the food comes out surprisingly fast for the amount of customers they're serving. Like all their locations, this one is 24/7 so you can get your fix anytime!\n",
      "It is late night, hangover food. The sliders are squishy in texture. The fries are fast food fries. It isn't bad, but it won't make your tastebuds sing either. It's a cheap meal when you are hungry and broke on the strip.\n",
      "The three stars is mainly for the employees working here, they are super nice. This is my first time trying White Castle and I really wanted to see what the hype was all about, but I was so disappointed. The beef patty is so thin you are basically eating steamed buns with pickles and cheese. The onion fries I got tasted how I expected it to taste, basically cut up onion rings. Glad I finally got to try this after so many years, but basically one and done for me.\n",
      "It's an experience not to be repeated. The burgers are slider size which is fine but they have no taste, ours weren't even warm and why would you want to stand in line for that?\n",
      "First time trying White Castle out and it was what I expected. These little cheap burgers definitely hit the spot. I wasn't expecting the soggy/steamy taste but it was surprisingly good. The area seems a bit sketch and the casino nearby looks a bit run down, but the food was good so I can't complain. I also don't see much crinkle fries around and this place had them! I ended going back the next day to get more of those delicious square burgers. Will definitely come back whenever I'm in Vegas again.\n",
      "honestly, for the trouble we went through to get here, I would not do it again. nothing special about these lil ass burgers. cheeseburgers from McDonald's are way better. trust me.\n",
      "Every time I see this place, I think about Harold & Kumar go to White Castle. Although I've seen and passed by this place every year for the past several years, I finally decided to come in and try the place in February. I actually walked from The Excalibur here and walked back. In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure. I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal. The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in. I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more. Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out. If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home. The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better. As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders. I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer. The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol.\n",
      "Came here for an early lunch. I think it was 10:30 am when we got here. This White Castle is located on the strip near Venetian hotel and casino. Hubby wanted to come here. I was not impressed but super hungry. I got a number 2 which consisted of 4 small White Castle cheeseburgers with crinkle cut fries and a drink. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries. I had a raspberry iced tea. The burgers were filled with cheese and pickles. I don't like pickles in our burgers. I think this place gets too much hype. Place had refill Coke soda station like the old school fountains. Descent place to eat. The guy at the register was super nice. The guy calls your number when your food is ready. You basically dump your own trash. There is plenty of seating. At least I got to try this place once.\n",
      "I don't know what to say about White Castle sliders... Realistically speaking, there shouldn't be any reason why a slider from White Castle should be appealing: (1) cheap, soft, over processed rolls which are reminiscent of what you can expect from the buffet at Pondegrossa, (2) over-cooked, greasy patty cut in a ridiculous, bite-sized 2x2 inch square, (3) a diced and sliced mixture of onions and pickles that are better suited for a hot dog or a stupid, McDonald's hamburger... ...And yet, they're surprisingly good. They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible. And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor. I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while. After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere. As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc. Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider. Who knows? It might get really weird.\n",
      "This place was the worst! They hype up this place too much. DO NOT GO IN THERE WITH EXPECTATIONS!!! The burgers look fake and ridiculously tiny. Sad to say but McDonalds is better! Never again\n",
      "We were so excited to try this place and we highly disappointed. Unfortunately, $60 worth of food went into the garbage. What a waste!\n",
      "I went here for my first time and the food was great. Shaylene was very friendly and patient when my party didn't know what we wanted. She even recommended some items to us.\n",
      "Las Vegas White Castle is NOTHING like an ORIGINAL White Castle. VERY rude staff. Las Vegas White Castle is nothing like the original White Castle we use to eat from, back in Michigan. The food does not taste the same like the White Castles in Midwest.. They don't even offer their best burgers in a the Las Vegas location.\n",
      "I really don't have much to say. I've grown up eating these and when I found out there was one in Vegas, I was stoked. I'll be sure to make my way to Vegas a little more often now.\n",
      "Currently drunk, hungover or nearly out of money should be the only reason to stop here. It does the job of filling you up for a low price. Nothing special except for the people watching.\n",
      "I remember as a kid having White Castle from the frozen food section of the grocery store and I was not too impressed with them back then. So when we saw they had a location to try on the strip I was interested in trying them. Well the taste is no better then what you would get from the grocery store, so might as well stick with that if they are the same plus you don't have to wait in long lines like you do at this place. On the bright side they are pretty inexpensive compared to the other food choices offered on the strip.\n",
      "The food is fabulous, just what I remembered. Strip prices sure, a meal with 2 burgers fries and drink is 7.99. The restaurant it self is small I was expecting a larger place with their fan following but the service was very fast for as busy as they were and we will definitely go back to get our White Castle fix!\n",
      "I was amped up to come here mainly because of the movie and also I've only ever had the frozen burgers. I was also curious what else White Castle had to offer other than the obvious. I had chicken rings which were basically like chicken nuggets with a hole in the middle. The burgers tasted pretty close to the flavor I've experienced with the frozen kind. I don't know if that speaks to White Castle's ability to freeze and recreate in the microwave or what. It's okay. Wouldn't make the trip to this part of the strip specifically for White Castle but wouldn't object if I was part of a group who all wanted to eat there.\n",
      "Great customer service nice location right in the casino. We forgot to ask for cheese and they gave us some on the side for free. Cheese is big deal for me and they were so accommodating. If u have a big appetite and looking to sober up go to another food place or order like 10 burgers. I ate like four burgers and was still hungry.\n",
      "I was actually expecting something... more exciting. My friends and I ordered the sliders. They tasted pretty okay. The soft texture of the bun, the thin patty, and the diced onions, reminded me of the little hamburgers in the Happy Meals from McDonalds. The presentation is cool and all, with the little boxes, but other than that, there's really nothing special about them. And the way that it's so hard to find somewhere to sit and how messy the area is.. it just kills the appeal some more for me.\n",
      "Was expecting sooooo much but was soooo underwhelmed. I couldn't even get ketchup or mustard on my burger! Come on man! So disappointed. Better off getting the frozen ones! Oh and it's like triple the price from back home!\n",
      "The place looks okay, but nothing that's too appetizing that I would like yo come back here. My husband and I tried chicken, beef, and fish sliders. And all three of them didn't live up to the flavor, didn't like the food at all.\n",
      "Lov love love this I wished we had this on OAHU, HI!\n",
      "I just want to point out how thin these \"hamburger patties\" are. This place was full of mediocracy. 12 buck on 4 sliders and cheese bacon fries and we are leaving less than dissatisfied. 2 stars because the fries were good but save your self some time and walk a little bit down the strip to a joint called in-n-out! So sad, because we were excited to try something from the east coast!!! Maybe it's just this place, I will give White Castle another try while in NY. But never here again\n",
      "When I found out they were opening a white castle here I was pretty excited. I had only ever had the ones in the freezer section, which a friend told me was not \"real White Castle.\" Spoiler alert: they were basically identical. I didn't come here looking for some amazing burgers but I was looking for something worth all the hype. $6 for 4 little sliders seems pretty pricey. These things taste just like McDonald's double cheeseburgers except they are about a third of the size and the same price. Luckily there was no line when I came. The extra star is basically just because the employees were nice.\n",
      "I feel silly reviewing the actual burger - surely it's something you've had before and can't we all just agree Krystal has vastly superior cheap sliders ? The burger itself isn't anything special and clearly it has to be a nostalgic thing for you to actually enjoy eating them (how brainwashed are you Midwestern people?). That being said my pregnant self wanted a slider for a snack at 10 AM and this place delivered. There was no wait at 10:00 AM (surprise surprise) and the food was cheap (for the strip) and came out very quickly (maybe 3 mintues?). The place was clean, not overly crowded and a nice fast snack option for when you're roaming the strip.\n",
      "This is the WORST WORST WORST PLACE. It is over hyped. Watching Harold and Kumar made me think this place was going to be awesome, BUT NO. This place is horrible. I have the food, the fries were not even great. And the meat...is that even meat? It comes with pickles and onions. If you have ever been to inn n out you would know that it's not comparable at all. I don't know why everyone loves it. I absolutely despise it. The wait is about 10-15 minutes and its definitely not even worth a second of it. The only thing I enjoyed was my soda...\n",
      "If you're looking for garbage, this is the place to go. Came here in the AM expecting some decent, if not lower quality food to fill my drunken hungry state. The quality and taste of this food is absolutely appalling. This establishment needs to shut itself down for the betterment of he public. The only reasonably enjoyable portion of my meal was the soda that came from the soda machine.\n",
      "The 2 stars are exactly what it means. I have experienced better. Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry. Im trying to understand how east coast peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product. I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went. Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter. So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change. I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders. Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing. In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

      "Absolute trash. I've heard so many stories from my friends on why I must try out White Castle burgers so sure enough I went. It was about 1 AM and I was starving so I dropped by to get some burgers. Given that I was starving and have heard such great things about this place I was very excited. Little did I know this place is literally the worst burger joint I have ever gone too. Their burgers look like they are frozen and then simply just microwaved. I would NEVER come back here again and would advise that everyone stay away.\n",
      "First timer to white Castle and definitely NOT the last! Attached to Harrah's casino.\n",
      "A typical White Castle but very well maintained & the staff were timely as well as friendly. Fresh sliders to go were on point & delicious.\n",
      "This place conveniently next to The Venetian comes in CLUTCH when it's past 2am and most of the major/good foodie spots along the Strip are closed and you just really need something to EAT. While the wait is a bit long and it's not the most high quality fast food, it gets the job done (and the hangovers cured, let's be real).\n",
      "My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today. We wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Neither one of us was impressed. I had to choke, literally choke down my sliders, then was nauseous the rest of the evening. Buns, were soggy, meat tasted old. Fries were of the frozen variety, not evenly cooked or seasoned. We paid roughly $10 for the #2 and shared it.. let's just say I can get a steak and lobster for that price in town and not be sick or disappointed. We can say we've scratched it off of our bucket list, but will not be back.\n",
      "These burgers are (in a musical tone) teerribbllle! Wow I thought in and out burgers were bad, I could not even finish my food here. I took it out to the bums outside and even they wernt real happy about the offer. This Food really sucks.... wtf..\n",
      "White Castle of the East on the Vegas of the West! I've been to a White Castle before in the Bronx of NYC wile on tour being that is the only other time I've actually had their food you so know that we are going here especially late night after a few drinks! Being from California we don't have White Castles anywhere around so we go to In In Out and it's always just magically delicious and what we crave! The burgers here were soggy but I think it's because they steam them overall I'm not a fan of soggy buns I wasn't impressed enough by the burgers to ever really want to visit one of their locations again. The onion chips were decently good though and went well with their BBQ sauce and made your burger taste a bit better if you added one to it. The other thing I thought was funky was how they had chicken rings and onion chips either way I don't find my self craving anything from here like they advertise. The line moves fairly quick though well at least for us it did as well as our food came out quickly too! They sell beer here too so that's definitely awesome if your in it for a burger and beer! Well what I will say is if you have never visited a White Castle and your next to one after you've had a few drinks pay them a visit because you might like it more than I did.\n",
      "I'm confused. Why would you choose this place over all other places in Vegas? It's terrible. I had to try it because of the movie and I'm from the west coast so this was my chance but it was a lesson learned. Never coming back. Flavorless. Worst fries ever. Mystery meat? Why is the line so long? Welcome to stinktown.\n",
      "Fries were good, but the burgers were just any old burger slapped together but just made mini.\n",
      "Oh how I love these little sliders. These sliders take me back to my youth and they are amazing. It is Las Veags, and it is a bit pricey, but for any true sliders fan; they know these are the best little burgers. The flavor is amazing and the softness of the bread is excellent. I love how they cook the sliders over a bed of steamed onions. Nothing has changed here since I first had one as a little kid. If you did not grow up on these sliders than you missed out. I love White Castle. Finally the west coast is catching up.\n",
      "For over 30 years I've been hearing about White Castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location. Fast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive. Now, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie. The slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.\n",
      "What's all the hype???? I will never understand. Upon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area. The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean, if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times. I wasn't impressed, once was enough for me.\n",
      "This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest. So, the GOOD: - Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest - They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all) - The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning - The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line The BAD: - The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes. Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles. - The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns. But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good. - The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly. - The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely. - It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research). SUMMARY: Go here. It's good. So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome. PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day. Always consume with ketchup. HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated: White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets. For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you. Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders. Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.\n",
      "I felt like I had to try it since it's so well known, talked about, and movie about it. I never make it to the east coast and now that there is one in Vegas, I had to try it. So far I've only had the frozen ones which are just \"ok\". Well unfortunately it tasted the same as frozen. Guess that says how good of a job they did with the frozen burgers, but also about how \"meh\" the burger is. I'd imagine the prices are a lot higher at the Vegas location than ones on the east coast, at least I hope so for there sake. They had combos with 2 or 3 sliders and the things are so tiny I wouldn't be surprised if people easily take down 10. I got a single, a double, then split some onion rings (although they werent rings, what? they qere quarters) and chicken rings (which actually were rings). There is way better food on the strip, especially for burgers, but if you go here, I suggest just trying it for a drunking snack, not for a real meal.\n",
      "So when I heard this famous east coast fast food burger joint was coming to Vegas, I was really hyped! But when we got there it was met with disappointment! The burgers tasted exactly like they came out of the frozen food section. I mean if that's how it's suppose to taste, that's fine but I was disappointed. It was nice to finally eat at this world famous joint but wasn't impressed. The chicken rings and onion chips were pretty good and that's why it's an average (3 star) rating. The wait was nonexistent. We walked right in and ordered (we went in on a Wednesday around 11am). We found it easiest to get there by parking at the Venetian and walking towards the strip and hanging a left.\n",
      "Even with people ordering Craver Crates of 100+ White Castle sliders in front of me, my order came out fully cooked in less than 15 minutes. That's amazing for a Grand Opening first day. White Castle is now open on the Las Vegas Strip, across from The Mirage and inside of the Casino Royale. They serve beer via those cool stadium bottom up cups. The sliders are small, so be sure to order more than a few at a time. Their drink stations easily accommodated all of the people on opening day, so they should be good to go from now on. I like their fudge covered cheesecake bite on a stick for dessert.\n",
      "I was not expecting a lot from White Castle, as they do not advertise any gluten -free options. I was overly impressed. The manager at the location took the time to explain how they grill their burgers and said that they could make their sliders with no buns. They even cleaned the grill before they made them and kept them separate from all of the other burgers. The taste of the burger was amazing for fast food. They were a little pricey, but the flavor of the food made up for the price. I would definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a quick and delicious night night snack!\n",
      "Most people that eat here know what White Castle belly bombers are. Or the very similar Crystal burgers. They aren't gourmet burgers by any means, but these little squares are addicting! Like little sliders that everyone should try. And this is probably the only one, anywhere, that serves beer too!\n",
      "Being a self proclaimed burger expert I had been waiting to come here for ages. Last time I came to Vegas I didn't find out there was a white castle here till I had left. This time however I made a point to come here. Now I've been eating quality burgers my whole life and yes I can be a little critical at times. However when I came to white castle in Vegas I was in a very vulnerable position. I was extremely hungover, even a big Mac would have made me happier than anyone could imagine. So I naturally got in line and asked what I should order since it was my first time at white castle. I got a very vague response that the beef was good and that the chicken was good as well. With this information I order 4 beef sliders, 2 chicken sliders, fries and a drink for a total of around $17. I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas. These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor. It tasted like something that was pulled out of the frozen food section, microwaved and then given to me. If anyone from Cali is reading this, we aren't missing out on anything by not having white castle. The east coast however y'all definitely missing out on not having in n out.\n",
      "The worst burger I have ever had in my life. The sogginess of the burger meat and the bottom bun was repulsive. Will never go there again.\n",
      "My parents and I passed by this place while we were in Vegas about two weeks ago. I mentioned that I had heard a lot of good things about this place and that there were no locations in California where we live. Well, that was good enough for my parents to say \"Let's go inside to check it out.\" We checked it out and then decided to eat here for our dinner as we didn't want to eat at one of the many buffet places (i.e. hotels) along the Strip. The food was very good. We started with the sliders combo with fries and a soda. The sliders were awesome. One silder was clearly not enough among the three of us. We ended up ordering the fish slider. That too was awesome. The other great thing about our first experience was the service. Excellent service! The employees were very kind. They treated us like a part of the family. I can't wait until they come to my neck of the woods.\n",
      "I think just like most people, my curiosity for White Castle developed after watching the first Harold & Kumar. I never wanted to settle for the frozen stuff because I wanted to try the real thing, or at least as close as I could to the real thing which was the location in Vegas. I love sliders. If sliders are on the menu, I'm 110% all about sliders. They're just really delicious, bite-sized, soft and convenient little burgers. My girlfriend thought they were okay and tasted just like the frozen ones, but every bite was extremely satisfying. It ended tragically though. My motor skills weren't all there and I dropped a whole slider on the floor. Rest in peace, slider I never got to enjoy.\n",
      "One of few locations west of the Mississippi. This is located in the middle of the strip. Visited early in the morning. Wanted to order beef and chicken White Castle burgers. Offerings in the morning were fresh beef off the grill and what seemed like fairly older sitting chicken. We held off on chicken. Ordered 10 beef White Castle burgers. Onions with the mini patty burgers on buns. The burgers stayed warm for a good two hours. The fresh version of these burgers are similar to the frozen one in grocery stores. Service was quick. Burgers are okay.\n",
      "Heaven right here in Vegas! Being from the East coast there are several eateries I miss. Finally one has crossed the Mississippi! Belly Bombs! At first I wasn't thrilled at the location but I have changed my mind. There are tables up front by the windows perfect for people watching. The staff has always been great and keep the tables as clean as they can. Thank you White Castle!\n",
      "Oh how Harold and Kumar failed me... So much HYPE, but so little DELICIOUSNESS. First time I came here after about 10 years since I've watch the movie so I was extremely excited. This place is extremely busy and honestly the food here is mediocre. This is good quick drunk munchie type of food, but not worth the price. I ordered the two cheeseburgers with chicken rings and the total was about $10. It is very expensive for very little food. The thing that really bothered me was one of the rude worker. After waiting for about 15 minutes to get my food, I asked the lady what type of condiments that they served here because it was my first time here. Her response was, 'well condiment do you want.' So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary. This place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers. No reason to ever come back here again or ever recommend people to come here. It was overly hyped due to the movie and that is the only reason this place is busy.\n",
      "Yum yum yum! I had never tried White Castle before but I am definitely in love! Those tiny sliders are so delicious! Let's get one in San Diego please! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the environment. It wasn't very comfortable to stay and eat when numbers and people were regularly being yelled at through the intercom....\n",
      "Line moves fast here so even if long line it's so worth it. White Castle is the best, as long as you just expect a regular burger at a great price. Anyone who complains is a food snob. I get the microwave ones all the time so was happy to get it fresh finally with a pickle. Us west coasters miss out. It is consistent quality and a unique experience. Go with 4 cheese sliders, and you'll walk out full without your wallet hurt. I'd compare it to in and out, it's not 5 star burger, but the price makes it uber yummy!!! :)\n",
      "My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat while driving down the strip & our taxi guy recommended White Castle, he said its \"cheap and delicious\". We had tried the frozen microwaveable ones so we figured we'd try the real deal, only to find out they taste exactly the same. Like they just came out of the freezer and into the microwave, so we were disappointed. I also got a side of the onion chips and I was so grossed out when I bit into it and there was an onion peel inside instead of actual onion.\n",
      "Finally got to eat at White Castle in Vegas! I believe this is the only one near the west Coast! It was delicious and I tried almost everything on the menu!!!\n",
      "So I'm from Texas and was in town. I've always wanted to try White Castle so I thought why not? Got there early around 10:30. No line and for my food quickly, but that's the only positive... Burgers were so cold my cheese wasn't even melted. Fries were old and horrible. Wish I could say better things, but for the price you really are better going somewhere else!\n",
      "This is a great place if you want to pay for overpriced burgers which taste exactly the same as the frozen ones that you can buy at the grocery store. Save your money and go to bachi burger or a few hundred miles to the closest in-n-out.\n",
      "So many haters...so little time. White Castle, regardless what state is in, is the bomb! Much like when I visit home (Chicago), WC is my first stop in Vegas. If you're one to compare it to in and out, your taste buds got some evolving to do...there is no compsirison! WC is better. And if Harold and Kumar is your only refereence to these little angels, thats sad. Much like most of the places on this strip, WC is always packed, but the staff is unfazed! The drunks, the Half Naked, the Regular Folks like me are all treated to the same great service and regular 15-30 minute wait on a good day (first visit was like an hour but since I didn't have any heart transplants to preform or any nations to conquer, i waited. That's the reason I came that day!) Because it's SO busy, you never have to worry about any food that's cold. The grill is ALWAYS going! The cost is the only thing I'm not liking. Seems about $4.00 more expensive than its Midwestern siblings for the same meal, but hey, it is Vegas. All in all I'm geeked that there is a taste of home now only 4 1/2 hours away by car and I try to take it as often as I can!\n",
      "It was just what I expected. The line was long but they served us fast. The burgers were fresh and hot. The order was made correctly and the environment was cleaned.\n",
      "Overpriced cold burgers, your better off buying them at the store in the frozen food section. The long lines and mass produced burgers by the hundreds creates a cold burger that is not worth the price. Hopefully White Castle will open a few more in Vegas with the real menu that is not charging an arm and leg for a burger.\n",
      "No I'm not high. I don't think. No...I'm not. Some friends who are strictly from the West Coast came to visit Vegas and wanted to eat at White Castle. I've never been there but thought \"if Harold and Kumar loved them, then let's go!\" I ordered 1 cheeseburger, 1 hamburger and 1 fish sandwich. All are served as sliders. I honestly really liked them. I don't really know what puts people off. Everyone in the group liked them. I know this place is popular, and my review won't matter, but next time I hit the strip, I'll stop by and get my \"little\" White Castle fix!\n",
      "Judge me, I'm giving 4 stars to a fast food. White Castle is rare on the west coast and that's partly what makes it so good. The closest thing to these little sliders in SoCal are in the frozen foods aisle of the grocery store. I got loaded fries and a slider. 1 slider because I didn't know if they were going to be giant sliders or tiny ones. The fries were crispy and definitely loaded. The slider was good but not enough so I got another one. They're like the size of a post-it. If you're comparing White Castle sliders to premium hamburgers then that's not a fair fight, White Castle goes into a category all on its own of fast food sliders. The employees are all really friendly. The food is good and soaks up all the alcohol you've been drinking.\n",
      "We actually ate here on Valentine's! Haha. I wasn't sure if I'd had WC before, and my wife hadn't. Plus we ate at Andre's the night before, so wth. I'll admit that my nice experience was probably due to the fact that we were staying on the strip (so no need to drive and park), our wait on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend was less than half an hour, we met some cool people in line, and we found these two private seats over in a corner with a floor to ceiling window. We got a ten pack plus loaded fries and a soda which really isn't much for two people. But then again, what's the point of getting sliders if you're just going to eat 20 by yourself? Go get In N Out instead. I actually enjoyed the food, although I'll always prefer In N Out. I can see why people say that you either need to grow up on it or be stoned to enjoy it. We downed a few drinks beforehand, but I think I would still enjoy the food sober.\n",
      "If this wasn't in a part of the strip that is a little...questionable, then I think the overall vibe would be a bit better. Anyway. The food is cheap. It's tasty. It's a novelty. Go for the experience. Try the onion strips. Mmmm.\n",
      "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle! I have seen this movie at least 5 times and I have been eating the frozen cheeseburgers for years!!! You can actually buy the 6 pack White Castle frozen burgers at Target, Safeway, and Walmart, which are very tasty if you microwave them properly! The only difference from the real deal is they don't have pickles on them, yet taste almost exactly the same as eating in person at the restaurant! On my recent visit to Las Vegas, White Castle was #1 on my list of tourist things to eat!!! My brother has been to the ones on the East coast, so he told me they opened up the very first West coast WC on the Las Vegas strip a couple months ago. To my surprise, it was just across the street from our hotel :D I was very happy to discover that White Castle is open 24/7. My first visit, was in the late afternoon, loooong lines, a bunch of loud drunk people, no where to sit, and crazy busy wait. We opted to eat a quick snack instead at the little Footlong Hot dog place in Casino Royale, and came back next day 10am!!! NO LINES and NOT crazy busy lol. Definitely had to try the Double cheeseburgers, Onion strips and of course the crinkle fries. I loved everything, Double cheeseburger was great, comes with the tiny onions and pickles, crinkle fries were great, and Onion strips were good. I really didn't mind the prices, for my first visit, it was worth it. I just want to say if you are a big eater, make sure you get yourself at least 4-6 cheeseburgers because they are tiny and won't fill you up compared to regular cheeseburgers elsewhere. I think White Castle is more like a snack for some people... Staff was very friendly and helpful, place was clean too! I am really glad I had the opportunity to come here and try it out for myself. It really was more about the experience and enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas. Next time I come back, I'll try the chicken rings and loaded fries. Menu is simple and easy to order from, and for drinks they have a fountain soda machine.\n",
      "I grew up eating White Castle in NYC since I was a toddler. I live in Los Angeles now and when go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with. Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food. First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced! The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double. I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost? I did notice the menu was a little different. I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips. And I'm fine with those menu differences. I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings. My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers. They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to. Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket. It's too bad because I was really excited to have a location out west.\n",
      "Vegas Valentine's Day Adventure! February 15, 2015 So lucky to have such an amazing boyfriend who planned the whole trip for us to eat in Vegas. Not only was I here for Shake Shack (my most favorite NY burger spot and the place I've been talking about for the past two and half years). So, after clubbing at Hakkasan, we went to get grub and feast on 30 burgers and two fries! Coming from a person who has never had White Castle, I loved it! The chicken rings burger was amazing too! After eating these, I wanted more and more the very next hour. Overall, spent $46 bucks on the food for two! Yes, he is perfect because we share our fatty side with each other\n",
      "The burgers are gross. But it's super clean, and the chicken rings are.. Okay if you've got the munchies\n",
      "I've been wanting to try White Castle since seeing how satisfying it was to Harold and Kumar. Unfortunately, living in Northern California, I've never been able to try it until now. These burgers were some of the best I've ever had. The simple formula of meat, pickle, and grilled onions on a soft roll makes for some amazing eats. I recommend everyone try White Castle at least once.\n",
      "Disgusting... I'm quite the burger fanatic and review on yelp quite often. I usually stick to eating at gourmet burger joints, rather than getting the fast food type, however in Vegas I had the chance to visit White Castle, a place I've always wanted to try after watching the Harold and Kumar movies.. I was very shocked at the standard of meat being used in the burgers.. it looked inedible and made me want to feel sick at the site of it.. The cheese and onions being used looked burnt and plastic looking.. There was no sauces etc inside the burger it was plain and stale... The prices are cheap, however I feel this place is more for those who are heavily drunk or intoxicated by other means... I would never try White Castle again... I'm shocked this place hasn't been shut down.\n",
      "I had my first experience at white castle and it was amazing. I'm local and I will be back. Raul the representative that help me deserve kudos for excellent customer service that he provided. I'll Definitely will return. Keep up the good work.\n",
      "Yay White Castle!!! Boo for the long lines! Never stood in them but my coworkers have. Thank you to them cuz I hate waiting in line! Lol guess I've been lucky to have someone go for me since they offer to go... I'm such a brat... Lol anywho, these little sliders are pretty tasty... Soft warm buns, grilled diced onions, pickles and cheese... Melts in your mouth as soon as you bite into it... I like adding a little ketchup and mustard. I get full from eating four of them... But if your really hungry they sell'um by the case or even by the crate... If you have the munchies like Harold and Kumar head over to White Castle!!! Lol These little sliders will surely fill you up!!!\n",
      "White Castle located inside The Casino Royal. Came to visit from Los Angles and saw there was a White Castle on the strip. Naturally, we went to get stoned and came to grub. The burgers tasted just like the frozen ones you buy at the store. Nothing extra, nothing special. The experience was good and the woman that attended us was cheerful so it was cool over all.... I'd come back again, why not.\n",
      "Vacationing in Vegas, I got excited that i saw there was a White Castle located on the strip. For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way. Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas. While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a \"Harold and Kumar\" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?) Save your money for gambling or find a better adventure.\n",
      "This place is awful!!! Whole family got sick from eating there. What type of meat is being used???\n",
      "0 stars barf. How can you even consider these burgers. I get the shivers every time I think about the unfortunate time I ingested these appalling whatever they are. BARF!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I've loved white castle! They only sell them frozen or have fresh ones in the east coast. I finally get to try the fresh ones. So darn deliciously. I don't have to go to the east coast to get them. Very good! Will back again and again!). :)\n",
      "Brand new burger joint in Vegas. I have eaten White Castle before, in Detroit -- so when I made this special trip to the las vegas strip -- (park behind Walgreen's -- free parking sssshhh!!! and you're in/out anyways and if I felt guilty I would go into Walgreen's and buy a gum or anything I need, which I am sure I can think of something). But when I got to WC the line, well people are so excited about it right now -- the line was down the street at least 45 minute wait a worker told me at the door so, I snapped these pics and left. I may go back.\n",
      "NAAAAAAAASTY!!! BURGERS tasted like paper! We were so disappointed! could honestly say we will NEVER eat there ever again.\n",
      "Oh how I've missed the original sliders from living in New York I used to get this tiny delicious melt in your mouth mini burgers!! I was extremely happy to be vacationing in Vegas & see that there've finally arrived on the west coast!!! Those who've written bad reviews obviously are those who probably eat at the Golden Arches & think that's good... From the smell & taste you can't go wrong here, with or without cheese love these little burgers!!! If your not a beef person check out the chicken rings trust you'll leave satisfied!!! Love me some White Castle\n",
      "It was my first time eating at White Castle. All I remember was eating the frozen stuff from the freezer aisle before this ever opened. I was sad coming here first because I don't eat red meat and I was just BLAH!!! Then, my friends said \"They have fish burgers, chicken.. I ordered so many for you!!!\" Seriously?! Harold and Kumar never promoted that in their movie!!! Hahaha! As you can tell, I had a little much to drink before eating but I was so excited after. It was delisshhhhh!!!!!! I was so happy.. I almost cried. I can officially say, I tried it! I think everyone should experience \"the hype\" and live up to that movie. Some will drive hours away for this, some will just walk from their hotel and devour it. I say, great experience! Pretty quick service too. I didn't order but it was fast haha! I would definitely go again if I end up wondering around the strip but it's rare I go. Just too crowded for me! Cheers and be safe my fellow yelpers. Eat on!\n",
      "Haven't had White Castle burgers since I moved from NY. Burgers were ok but I encountered bubble guts within an hour after eating them. The taste of these White Castle burgers isn't what I remembered. I will just buy the frozen one's next time.\n",
      "This shit is disgusting!! I wanted to see what the hype was since they made a movie about it. Boy did it disappoint. Luckily there was no line or anything at 1am. The workers were quick and friendly but the burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones and maybe even worst. Go to in n out when you want good tasting fast food burgers.\n",
      "I was so excited that Whit Castle opened up a location closer to the west coast, so I definitely had to eat there on my next trip to Las Vegas. My wife and I just recently visited this location on the morning of Friday 02/06/2014. We placed our order at the cashier and then head to the soda fountain to fill up our drinks. Before we are finished filling up our drinks, the man (5'8-5'10 with short hair) at the front counter is already calling out our number to pick up our order. I'm already trying my best and hurried up filling up our drinks so I can pick up the order. But within seconds after the first number call, the man at the front counter started to sound impatient and angry when he calls (yelling and screaming) out our number for the second and third time. I'm appreciative that they provide fast service on the orders, but the man really scared us and made us feel forced/rushed, it was very unprofessional! Note (02/26/2015): This location barely just opened and it's the first location on the west coast, it's already at 2.5 star overall rating on Yelp, it's shameful and embarrassing.\n",
      "I don't understand what the hype is about. I ate here for the first time and I feel disgusted to have even put their food in my stomach. My group and myself felt so ill and bloated afterwards that we would all rather regurgitate the food than continue to walk around the strip with it in our stomachs. These sliders were soggy and terribly put together. The sliders you get back in middle school that were in a bag were way better than this. My fries either had the flu or were just old because they were pale and felt like rubber. If you are sober and looking for a decent meal to eat so that you can sight see, DO NOT EAT HERE! The food will make you sick. Never again. Best thing was the fountain drinks.\n",
      "Pretty disappointing especially since it got so much hype from Harold and Kumar, but I had to try it when I saw that they had a location in Vegas. You can buy sliders individually without a combo meal or without getting a 10 pack. I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas). Super disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup. Yeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip. Only good thing is that you get your food fast after you order.\n",
      "Highly disappointed. I have been eating the frozen white castle burgers ever since I was a kid so I was super excited to finally try it unfrozen. I still liked it, however it tastes exactly the same as the frozen ones. Next time i'm gonna drive/walk the extra miles to go to shake shack because those burgers are 10x better!\n",
      "Nothing special. I wouldn't make a special trip. Don't waist your time or your money. Maybe it's better on the east coast. Very disappointed\n",
      "Soggy no flavor and the line is ridiculous also no where to sit down don't know what I was expecting eating sliders at the bar the other day ooh and they don't give you a refund only store credit if I'm returning my food it's because I don't like it I will not want to come back ever\n",
      "I never knew I could hate a burger so much. It was so greasy that it soaked the bun. The meat made McDonalds look bomb. Everything about the burger was unappealing. I had to try this place just to see what Harold and Kumar chowed down on. I literally have no idea why it couldn't have been Harold And Kumar Go To Any Other Burger Place Cause White Castle Is Nasty. Worst $1.00 I've ever spent in my life.\n",
      "I don't understand the hype, tastes like shit and it's crowded to the point where you fight for a table. It tastes like a double priced McDonald's. Imma go throw up now.\n",
      "The first time I came to White Castle, the line was out the door. I was excited to try the sliders! After the first bite, I had no idea what the fuss is about. The sliders are small and sad looking. Not much flavor aside from the cheese. And that's only if you get the cheeseburger sliders! The original sliders are underwhelming. The lines are seriously puzzling... is there a secret menu I'm not aware of?! On the most recent, the hubs wanted to try the chicken rings. It's a rip off. It's like a nugget, pounded super thin and then they punched a hole in the middle to make it a \"ring\". Better off going to Shake Shack or even McDonald's dollar menu.\n",
      "For us West Coasters this is as close as we'll get to a White Castle with out taking a 4 hour flight. My favorite is the chicken slider. Its juicy, tender and delicious. The regular sliders are good also. My wife and I at here at around mid night on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy. Expect to wait about 15 minutes for your food.\n",
      "What's the big deal about this place. Small burger, cheap cheese and no flavor. This hamburger is like many new Yorkes that i know. Small, tasteless but they think they are the #!**^. I need in and out now.\n",
      "Just like back home no disappointment here bought a 10 pack and they didn't make it to the freeway home super yummy\n",
      "I am from California and Im super interested about White Castle's food. The tiny little burgers were alright and the onion fries were delicious! Overall it was a good experience, but there are many more burger places that surpass this place. I would like to mention that the staff here are excellent, the cashier helped us out choosing food since we didnt know what to get and was very kind and sweet. I dont remember his name, but we really appreciated his help!\n",
      "Honestly not impressed. I've heard so much hype about their food and it really was no different then the cafeteria that is at my university. also, they messed up my order. i understand that times can get busy, but when i show up and there are only 4 people in line i would hope i can get the right order. Also, I'm not sure how good i feel about eating chicken that is in the shape of a ring LOL, something tells me chickens don't grow like that.\n",
      "Didn't have to wait in line. Staff was friendly. Food was delicious even it was small portions. Price was reasonable for the quality of food and portion size. Food was made fresh and when order can see the process going into it. When purchase drink the fountain is accessible to you during the time you stay and eat. Would recommend it if you like slider and burger. Would come back and dine in again.\n",
      "It took way too long for the strip to get a White Castle, but Im glad it came. We stopped in at a typical White Castle dining time (3 am) and it was packed so we almost left, but they did a pretty good job of getting the food out there quickly, so it was well worth the wait. It is too expensive though, I know its the strip, but its still White Castle, come on!\n",
      "White Castle isn't for everyone as you can see from some of the reviews, but if you have fond memories of them and haven't lived near one for years, this location delivers. As a midwesterner transplanted to SoCal I looked forward to trying them again on my visit to Vegas and it lived up to expectations. Line was extremely long and like everything else on The Strip it's a bit overpriced, but it will satisfy a slider craving.\n",
      "It's White Castle. Shit is steamed delicious goodness. The Ritz it ain't but what else do you want? They serve glasses of beer and they are connected to the slot area of a hotel. It is my humble opinion that this is a combination for success. Also, the line moves pretty quickly.\n",
      "I give them 3 stars because the food is to my liking; however, there are a few things that I don't like about this place... 1). You have to park at a hotel and walk through the casino to get out to the strip to do some more walking just to get to the place. (walking I don't mind so much, good exercise - trying to keep a positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol) 2). When you do finally get there, you have to wait in line and depending on when the tables are cleared/available and how many people you have with you (besides how packed they are) will determine how long you wait until you get inside - only to have to wait in another line to order your food. 3). They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo. 4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open. (Im not a fan of heat; and yes Im aware I live in Vegas lol) ***Lastly, I hope they open more locations so for some of us locals who tend to avoid the strip wont have to go to there. As good as the food was, the traffic on the strip, parking at the hotel, and dealing with all the tourists is enough to keep me away.\n",
      "Having been dubbed as 'gut bombers' by friends from the Midwest, I should have known better not to dive straight into the pits of hell. Unfortunately, the term still holds true despite of being in this side of the country! Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there. I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down. If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk! After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment. Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile. To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area. It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment. At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation. We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food. The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago. For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco. This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them. Overall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders. As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol.\n",
      "I'm completely in love with this place but you won't be full unless you spend at least 20$. So satisfying especially after watching Harold and Kumar and the place is open 24/7!\n",
      "Damn you, Harold and Kumar for hyping up this place! I was hoping that when I ate it fresh, it would taste better than the frozen ones you can buy at the supermarket... I was wrong, they taste the SAME. My friend warned me and told me it tastes like cardboard. I wouldn't go to that extreme, but I probably wouldn't go back. It's really not that cheap for small burgers and mediocre fries. If I'm comparing cheap fast food burgers, I prefer McDonalds.\n",
      "Ummm...yeah...so I expected WAY more from this place. Considering all the hype this place gets in comparison to In N Out. The flavors were ok but the bun was so soggy and it didn't remotely taste fresh. Sadly will definitely not be coming back here again.\n",
      "First time having White Castle in a few years and it was a disappointment, burgers taste like the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store each tiny burgers were about over $1 in n out is way better!\n",
      "Decided to take a bunch home for my son and nephew. Haven't had these lil gems since I lived back East and now that the lines have gone down figured why not. Lil pricey to feed 3 persons and to be honest not as tasty as I remember them to be. Not much difference from the frozen ones at the grocery store. Ok if you're in the area otherwise I wouldn't make a special stop.\n",
      "finally tried this place out. the food is way overpriced for what you get. low quality overpriced. first time is the last time.\n",
      "It's White Castle!!! After moving out of Michigan White Castle is hard to come by, besides frozen and those are just not right! This curbed the \"crave\" while being in Las Vegas. Yes, the prices are higher...it's Vegas!! The lady behind the register was lovely, polite, and patient while we got our order together. The food was served quickly.....not usually the case at most White Castles! Burgers were what we expected but the chicken was full of grizzle and had me very dissatisfied in that department. Yes, it was dirty and the drink station a mess but there was a worker cleaning. I chalked that up as that they were busy. Management probably needs to put someone in the seating area cleaning at all times just to keep up on the traffic and mess! Would I go back....if in Vegas again.... Well Yes.....It's White Castles!!!\n",
      "The sliders were ok, due to the cool little box the bun got kinda mushy, other than that the chicken rings were really good, I think eating here is more to say I got to eat at White Castle rather than going for the actual food its self\n",
      "I just don't get this place. I think it's a nostalgia thing for midwesteners but as a west coast person I don't get it.\n",
      "I came to White Castle with my cousins who were excited to try it out as they had been to White Castle locations when they lived on the East Coast but could not find any of its locations in LA. The beauty of the strip is that you could be eating gourmet burgers from super star chefs one day and sliders from the freezer section of your local grocery store the next. As expected we ordered a bunch of stuff like original sliders, cheese sliders, onion rings, curly fries, chicken nuggets etc. The onion rings and chicken nuggets were outright nasty. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of those. The sliders specially the cheese slider was surprisingly very good. The buns were nice and soft without any sogginess. The pickles, cheese and patties came together very well. I chomped on six of these bad boys with ease so definitely order a bunch of them to fill you up. What I like about White Castle is that it does not try to be something that it is not. It is located opposite to one of the seediest dive bars that you will find on the strip and below a dumpy hotel both of which I have had the good fortune of sampling. Been there, done that, have no intention of repeating.\n",
      "After eating this fake meat, complete with holes so u get even less, I realize that in the Midwest they must not have a lot to choose from to go on about this place. I will never go back.\n",
      "As far as my first White Castle experience goes...I don't remember much of it. It's conveniently located on the strip to catch all the intoxicated folk walking by. It was pretty decent food, but I wasn't expecting the sliders to hold a thin sandwich like meat instead of an actual patty. Also, the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking. On the other hand, the service was pretty quick and I can't complain about what I ate after leaving the club--I was full at the end of the night, and that's really all the matters at the end of the that kind of night.\n",
      "First time ever at a white castle. Was pretty average. It was busy, but what do you expect on the strip. Burgers were good to soak up the booze at the end of the night. Would go again because the price is right for were it's located. Just expect to wait in line for awhile.\n",
      "Late night muchies! Why? Because they're open all day! food was descent nothing really special except it's WHITE CASTLE!!! so if u want to try the famous place ; this is the place!\n",
      "I'm not a big fan of fast food, it's so unhealthy for you. When you're hungry and have limited options then maybe. If you're walking the strip, you're been drinking and hungry then White Castle is a must! It's a newer spot on my way back to my hotel so I figured, why not? What you eat in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the Jalapeño Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well. The staff here is what you expect from a fast food restaurant but the customers are interesting. It ranges from the very drunk, drunk, families to completely sober people. Luckily they have ample tables and seating in their dining area. It could be cleaner but you have to option to take out. For me, I'm glad this experience stayed in Vegas.\n",
      "The vegetarian burgers are HORRIFIC. Literally horrific. It's a bun with a small veggie Pattie in it, no toppings, no sauce, no cheese, no NOTHING. We drove way too far for us to go back and ask for toppings on a burger, but who in the hell puts NOTHING on a burger!? **Edit: I ordered one sweet chili veggie burger and one ranch veggie burger.... Neither of which had anything but bread and a veggie pattie. Also, onions and pickles are vegan and come on all of your other burgers (FYI to the business owner who wanted to mention that cheese isn't vegan, as if this somehow remedies the situation or amounts to any sad excuse for customer service)**\n",
      "Trash food, trash service. Ate here for the second and LAST time last week. First time was last summer. Only reason I went back was because my friend had never tried them before and he will agree when he said \"that food was pretty wack.\" After waiting over 10 minutes to get our food, (which was to be expected as I learned from my first visit since they can be pretty busy at times) our fries were cold and stale. I was so hungry though that I ate my 5 sliders before going back up to the counter to tell them about the fries. The manager tells me \"you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold\". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left. White Castle food is trash and their management reflects their product. I will NEVER waste my $$ or time there again.\n",
      "Can I review this place a billion times so it receives 5 stars?! Place is amazing!!! These burgers are little morsels that melt in your mouth!!! They have cool beer cups and the service is good!! Love it\n",
      "***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 54/100*** You know what they say... when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol. After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star. We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories. White Castle, check, on to the next adventure.\n",
      "I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars. We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose \"lightly\" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve... Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas. Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that. ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right. Vegas needs to step it up.\n",
      "I finally got to try this hype machine and meh is right! I've been wanting to check out White Castle ever since I saw the first Harold and Kumar movie. After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place. Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close. The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess. While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed.\n",
      "This is as good as it gets late night noshing. They don't look great, the location is small and weird right inside of the gross Casino Royale, everyone inside is plastered, and it just doesn't matter. When your number is called and those little boxes of heaven are handed over, all the pain in the world goes away and the most amazing flavor of deliciousness is all that matters. I suggest getting doubles; double the meat, double the cheese, double the fun! I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones. It is not a spicy jalapeno flavor at all, just a little kick to let you know it's there. Just an added bonus for who like a little spice. There's not much more to say. If you're looking for a gourmet burger, this is not it. But if it's late, you've lost some money at the tables, and you just want something delicious to chomp on, this is the place. The lines can get long, but who cares? It's Vegas. Grab a drink and relax. What are you in such a hurry for anyway? SIDE STORY: My wife got hit on right in front of me and I still didn't care. White Castle. That's all that matters. She stayed with me.\n",
      "Disappointed I thought it would be way better then the microwavable Frozen ones... taste the same\n",
      "White Castle is just another east coast burger joint that doesn't quite do it for me. My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys. On to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to \"Buy 'em by the sack\" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach. Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant. All in all I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, at least not sober. It's definitely a place to try just because of it's notoriety from the east coast but don't wait in line if it's over 30 minutes! You will be disappointed!\n",
      "Being from the West Coast, the first time I heard of White Castle was watching that Harold-and-Kumar-get-really-high-and-need-to-fix-their-munchies movie. After that, I noticed that you could buy them frozen in the supermarket and defrost them to get a fix. When I heard an actual location opened up in Vegas, I made it a point to get there eventually. It took me 3 trips to Vegas to finally go because I was scared away by the potential crowds. Well, it finally happened. It's located on the outskirts of Casino Royale on the strip, really easy to find by foot. I came on a Wednesday around 11 am. There was a very short line but the seating area was pretty full. I asked the cashier when it starts getting crazy, and she told me after noon. A hot tip for you guys, earlier is better. The service was great, and the seating area was clean. I ordered ten sliders with cheese, onion rings, and fries. The fried stuff was meh but the sliders were delicious. Meat, cheese, onion, and a soft roll. They taste better than the frozen ones because they're cooked fresh. The difference isn't that noticeable though. Verdict: I love their sliders. I don't care that they're mostly bread with very little meat. I'm not coming here to be healthy. Note: They have cheesecake on a stick. I regret not getting it. They also sell beer.\n",
      "Having never been to the east coast, I wanted to give these guys a whirl. $8.99 got me 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a soda. I scarfed those bad boys down and thought they weren't half bad. Couple days later I got the 2 dbl chs w fries and soda for $7.99 but thought the middle bun was too squishy and unnecessary. Not much of a line, pretty quick service, what could be better?\n",
      "This White Castle seems to be more expensive than in Chicago but I guess we're paying for convenience. It was clean and nice and you can watch your food being prepared. The food didn't really stand out as it was fast food overall, but I'd come again if I was craving their famous sliders. FYI it is $1.29 for each burger slider and you'll want to eat a couple as they aren't that filling.\n",
      "It's as good as White Castles found back east. If you loved them there, you get the same ones here. If you have never had them before, like my California friends you might not like them. A guy who works at a hotel here said they aren't as good as Jersey, then said that in n out is not good either and he prefers Sonic. I think his taste buds have died, and there is NO way he is from Jersey.\n",
      "WHY WE WENT HERE: - we had just eaten and were just strolling along down The Strip, when we stumbled onto this place - if you don't know who Harold & Kumar are, then don't talk to me THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE): - clear windows allow you to easily see how packed this place is! THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE): - limited and narrow seating - with the limited space that this place has, it's pretty good on the traffic line for those awaiting to order THE MENU: - castle combos - castle packs - bigger cravings - sliders - sides - dessert on a stick - beverages - breakfast WHAT WE ORDERED: - the original slider - cheese slider - french fries - onion chips THE LOOK/TASTE: - the packaging is so cute! - the sliders were good! - the french fries were basic - the onion chips were ok, i prefer them to be in rings CUSTOMER SERVICE: - fast - polite enough, considering the high volume of customers\n",
      "Good Mini burger with lots of fresh onions can't get enough of these burgers yummy I can't wait to go back will tell all people in California\n",
      "I used to hear my friend talk about eating at White Castle. He was so hype about it. So once I saw this, I had to go try it. Service was great. Food was prepared quick. I ordered the double slider, cheese slider, and a fish slider. Size is your typical small slider size; smaller than a McDonalds. The food was just plain. Your bun, cheese, meat, pickles, onions? and that's it. If there was sauce, I couldn't taste it. Good thing they offered condiments like ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, zesty sauce, hot sauce, etc. Mayo went well with the fish slider I got. Honey mustard went well with the double slider. All in all, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I don't want to have to add my own sauce... Well, at least I tried it...\n",
      "What a disappointment! If you have visited the original locations in Illinois, do yourself a favor a STAY AWAY from this place. Grease-drenched, bland flavors reign supreme here, so no matter what you get you won't care for it much. The long lines, and the smoke stench that linger into the dining room from the casino floor, makes the experience really sub-par. I will wait to have another White Castle burger until I go back to the midwest.\n",
      "I hate the fact that I have to give a star in order to do a review. The food here was absolutely disgusting! They call those burgers that was the thinnest piece of meat I have ever seen. Not only did the food taste nasty but almost made me want to throw up so I can rid myself from the horrible taste that haunted my mouth after the food that I tried to eat from there. What a Waste of money. Not only that but it took way too long to get my food and the constant yelling of numbers made the atmosphere unbearable. First time here at this place and definitely will be my last time. You have been warned: don't ever eat here!\n",
      "Great things come in little packages... I love me some White Castle!! I've been to multiple locations on the east coast, and wish they would come to Cali, but Vegas is close enough for now. Having the cheeseburgers made fresh are 20x better than the frozen ones. Hands down, my favorite tasting fast food cheeseburger. I love the Hawaiian style sweet bread for a bun, the grilled chopped onions, the juicy flavor of the meat and the melted cheese. The chicken was juicy and tender and the breading was a little crunchy. Mmmmmm so good for a quick bite to eat. Many people come here to try the burgers and complain that they are small. Duhhh, they are called cravings because they are small slider type mini burgers. Either way, I love their burgers, and am glad to see a closer location. This location has beer, soda, donuts, fries, burgers with and w/out cheese, and chicken sandwiches. The line was long when I arrived, but moved really quick. The food was ready within 4 minutes and there was plenty of seats inside. We enjoyed our food before we continued walking, and took the 4 cheeseburgers we had left for later. Whenever I am in Vegas, you can guarantee I will stop by.\n",
      "Overrated ...two stars because the line was long but they work fast and have a system... Not sure how the original White Castle taste like but the meat looks like thinly sliced mystery meat with soaked grilled onions and one pickle.... If you must try at least get the cheese slider the cheese gives some flavor.\n",
      "Of course I had to go to White Castle! Reliving the good old days... \"... just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it! So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.\" - Anthony Anderson as \"the burger shack employee\"\n",
      "Being a west coaster all my life I was of course excited to try the infamous White Castle. Boy was I disappointed, probably the worst fast food I've ever had. The sliders were disgusting and the chicken rings we are par with the frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets my nephew eats.\n",
      "Average place to get a burger...... a slider, it's your classic New Yorker feel. Grab yourself a six pack and roam the strip!\n",
      "Nothing special about White Castle burgers. It was very pricey for small simple cube-shape burgers. It was worth the try but something I wouldn't eat again. We ordered number 7 with cheese for extra $3. The late night crowd is not a pleasant so I recommend anyone with little kids to go somewhere else.\n",
      "This place is over hyped and not worth filling up your stomach with, and emptying out your wallet for. Be prepared to be greeted by two security guards as you enter the front door. Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment. That is not intimidating at all. The GF and I ordered a slider and fries. I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her. Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up. It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card. Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles? A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called. I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it). Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic. There were so many employees at work. There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them. Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them. Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries. The slider was nothing special. It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones. The fries were average at best. They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them. Yelpers, you have been warned. Proceed at your own risk. If you are drunk, by all means, you will absolutely love it here. If you have standards, please head to our friend Ronald.\n",
      "White Castle has always been on my bucket list, thanks to Harold and Kumar. Last time my family and I visited Las Vegas, my brothers went and raved so much about the place. So we just went and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The burgers itself were kind of dry but I really did like the grilled onions in it. I just think if there was some sort of sauce in the burgers, it would've been much better. I was expecting much more. However, the price wasn't that bad. We got the combo with 20 burgers and two fries and it cost $25. So that wasn't bad at all. Overall, I'm glad I got to go to the place for the experience but I'm not keen on going back anytime soon.\n",
      "I understand they have just branched out to the west coast. Buuuuut.... This is not a \"full\" White Castle menu. No fish sandwiches. The only reason I eat there. I hope to see more options next time I'm in Vegas. For now I will travel back home to NJ for my White Castle fix.\n",
      "The same experience I get every year I come to Vegas. Except this time I ventured out a little and tried the Fish and Chicken slider. OH MY LORD THEYRE SO GOOD. The fish slider IS better than McDonalds Filet o Fish! Like whaaaaat?! The chicken slider was the right amount of crispiness and juicy and so was the fish slider. I got the double cheese slider as well and it was meh, I'm not a fan of White Castles Original, Classic, nor Cheeseburgers.. they're just too mushy for me and they smell weird. $10 for 1 double cheese slider, 1 fish slider, 1 chicken slider, and 1 soft drink. I'll be back for the chicken and fish sliders! The Fried Onion Chips were actually pretty good too!\n",
      "sad to say but the microwave burgers from costco tatsted better then what i experienced here. jerome was the most rude and disrespectful person i have ever dealt with...... will never come back here..... sad over all...\n",
      "I've been coming here since I found out about this place! And I love the burgers and the mozzarella sticks. I love coming here because they're always so friendly. The only thing I didn't like this time was that the table were super dirty. Another thing was that there was an employee fighting with a guest telling him to leave. The manager came and told the guy to leave and he said ok. And then then the employee left and came back and started telling the guy inappropriate stuff. That was unnecessary drama, but I still love the burgers !\n",
      "All HYPE! I was walking the strip and happen to walk past a sign that said White Castle. I look up and behold its a White Castle restaurant. I immediately walk inside. Take a look at the menu. All I see is these mini burgers. Anyways i went and ordered a combo. 4 small mini burgers fries and a drink. Service was fast. Line got back up but they are quick. Got my food. Had to find a spot to eat since the whole place was pack. This location is a gold mine for white castle. All the tourist walking by get lured in. Burgers was okay. Fries was generic. All this hype for some small burgers made famous by a movie. Give it a try. Only will try once again if a friend choose to eat here. Nothing special! Move along!\n",
      "Hello Mr. Michael, thank you just received the card today. I always loved white castles! Will go back for sure when I'm around Vegas!\n",
      "I literally came right here when I saw the billboards, didn't check into my hotel, didn't gamble, didn't even check out any beautiful women....I was having a serious crave. I moved to California a few years ago and have been dying for white castle. I took a star off simply because they DON'T HAVE CLAM STRIPS! I was a bit heartbroken...still kinda am. Where are my sack of clam strips with my crave case?!\n",
      "I don't know what all these people are complaining about. The food was delicious. They make the onion rings different but still good. My only issue is the lack of seating for larger and handicapped people. So from now on I'll just get it to go. And they need some big red. That's the best to wash it down with.\n",
      "I'm so impressed. Never would have come here! Drunken night, hungry....that's the place to go. John is a riot! The staff is incredibly friendly and patient. Chicken ring sandwich added pickle and onion...mmmmhhhhh! And bathrooms are 10 feet away, important in Vegas ;)\n",
      "Definitely love their sliders. The prices are very reasonable. I also got their loaded fried which were bomb I don't even really know what was in it but it was good. I only gave it 4 stars because when we ordered they had forgot to give us our chicken rings and it was already too late to go back and get them because we were so far so that sucked. But other than that great food. It's open 24 hours so it's good for when you just get out the club you can go here lol\n",
      "Buns seem to be steamed better than when I first came. Still disappointed with not having onion rings and clam strips on the menu.\n",
      "I've never had White Castle and when I saw it on the strip and it was close by our hotel, I decided to stop in. The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food. I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries. I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband. The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly. After I waited on the side for my order number to be called. It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags. The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly. When I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food. Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing. I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back. There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area.\n",
      "Super fast service and very friendly staff. I've been craving fresh sliders since I left the US midwest. Been eating the frozen sliders since there's no White Castle where I'm from. It was just as delicious as I remembered and of course tasted better than the frozen ones. I'm so happy someone opened a White Castle in Vegas!\n",
      "I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was so gross. The frozen ones are actually better then these. They have no flavor at all. After eating the first slider I started to feel sick and the 4 security guards all over the place makes it feel like we are being timed on how fast you eat so you can leave. There was no seating at all either.\n",
      "Grew up in CA and hadn't tried one before, and now I wish I had kept it that way. I ate two sliders and got a super super upset stomach for the next full 24 hours. It ruined a whole day of my trip. Worst part is that the food is on par with McDonalds so defs wasn't worth any aspect of the hell I went through the next day. Avoid at all costs! Go to Chipotle if you want something filling/fast and cheap.\n",
      "I finally made it out to white castle. Being able to eat the burger of my childhood fresh rather than frozen was like a dream. It's scary how close the taste is though. Nothing beats a fresh slider. Especially one with jalapeño cheese. Total game changer. Glad I got to make it out here and will continue to eat white castle whenever I can.\n",
      "Okay I was just strolling down memory lane and 5 W.C.B.s later (W.C.B. = White Castle BURGERS I refuse to call them \"sliders\")I had successfully completed my flash back to the early 90's, and the last time I went to a White Castle. The one closest to my Pennsylvania home closed due to fire, and I had since moved to Vegas.\n",
      "Love me some White Castle! Am originally from Michigan but now live in Virginia where there are none. So happy to find a oasis in the desert with White Castle on the strip! Sliders and onion chips as good as I remember and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Added bonus is this location serves beer and is also open 24/7. I'll be back!\n",
      "Came in at 7 am and there werent a lot of customers yet but my cousins and I are were very excited nontheless! Workers were very nice and sweet considering it was super early! Very quaint and clean environment! The portions are a bit tiny so you are gonna want more! Overall I loved it! I will be coming back!!\n",
      "Food was alright. I don't understand all the hype. The pricing wasn't bad at all considering it's on the strip. I would go back. My children really enjoyed themselves\n",
      "Hellooooooo White Castle! I've been waiting for you to come to the West Coast (or as close as can be to the West Coast) since the Harold and Kumar movie. Yes, it's been THAT long. -_- And those White Castle sliders in the frozen aisle of the grocery store do not do it justice! Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor. The direct entrance takes you through the dining area first while you make your way back to the counter to queue up and order. BF went all out for 2 people and got the #9 combo pack, which includes 20 original sliders and 2 orders of french fries. Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good! How successful were we in finishing the entire order? Maybe 70% of the way through. We dusted off all the fries and had only some sliders left. The remaining 30% was an excellent breakfast/lunch (not brunch since it was a weekday) meal!\n",
      "Except for the Curiosity factor this place was not satisfying. I have been to white castle in the past on the east coast they are quick, very inexpensive, and good for a snack. Worth it if you are looking for quantity rather than quality. However this place has none of that!!! Service was slow, Burgers were 3 to 4 times the price of the east coast, the place was a mess, No ice in machine, and the quality was much worse. I guess we should be lucky that we have the only white castle on the west coast but they really need to lower the prices increase the quality and get some Big Red in the soda machines.\n",
      "We walked into Casino Royale and smelt something that made us both say \"Damn!\". My husband asked the security guard where that smell was coming from and he pointed us to White Castle, while he laughed. I thought that he was laughing at our hungry noses but soon after realized that he knew we were going to get diarrhea from this horrible shit. The amazing smell was the onions caramelizing on the grill. The little cheeseburgers were soggy and full of unwanted flavor. I am not a picky eater & I do not recommend.\n",
      "My experience at White Castle was terrible, Tammy was the worse White Castle employee I have encountered in over 20 yrs. She was mean, rude, and her customers service is the worse EVER!!! Im really considering calling you guys corporate office. But the food was great im a fan forever. Tammy needs more training guys no way she should be a manager or supervisor thx 4 listening guys. Ps the onion are fried to much\n",
      "Made my first visit to a White Castle ever and found myself at the one on the strip. Ive had the microwave hamburgers and wanted to see if it would be any different. It was just OK. Nothing to write home about. The cheeseburger seemed really soggy and the fries were cold. It was good to try but i will try other places on the strip.\n",
      "OVERRATED. Wanted to try this place when they first opened but heard it was always busy. I thought, \"wow, it must be really good.\" I relied on regular tv news and drunk friends instead of reviewing yelp comments to help me decide if I was going to eat there and I paid the price. The taste of the meat was bland and the bread was like store bought buns. Really did not taste anything to make it stand out. I kept thinking I should have just gone to the store and bought the kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread and some burger meat and made my own. I did like the loaded fries. They were tasty but the serving size was small. Bright spot, i like how security tried to keep the line moving and safe.\n",
      "Well I been hearing that white Castle is the best and it's like in n out.... this had to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had ... I took 2 bites and to the trash it went the fries where pretty good\n",
      "We loved the very thin patties and super soft bread. Definitely not for those who like a meaty patty. Clean for being so busy. Great place for a fast food snack. I didn't like the ranch dressing, but I'm pretty particular about that.\n",
      "I had a terrible experience. It started off with me enjoying the fact that I'm in Vegas and seen a White Castle. I'm from Minnesota so to see a White Castle on the West Coast was like was Christmas in July. Finally found a parking spot this is really hard to there is no parking for them White Castle that is. Made it in and see no line, no surprise because White Castle always has a line. To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter. That's what got my attention he started screaming that there's a line of people and the people working are laughing joking not doing anything I noticed this was true they were all in a circle just kind of hanging burgers are sitting on the waiting table ready to be made or should I just say put together cuz they're already made and we're waiting. Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat. Very sad to save my hometown restaurant Kansas City Missouri where my family is from, we grew up on White Castles. Bunch of onions piled up in the corner little mustard a pickle man that bread something else. I tell a lot of people about White Castles and everybody says this or says that me I love him Frozen from Minnesota or Frozen from in the grocery store what I don't like is bad customer service and that's exactly what I got at this White Castle with Fred as the manager. It was so bad that the drinks didn't even work and the young man who only was able to get his drink had to be mad about that as well.\n",
      "Food is great this is the new burger spot for a while, good location and service it was busy at first but now it's pretty mellow\n",
      "It's not good at all. You go just for the experience of having White Castle because its not local to the west coast. The experience was cool but the food is meh. I hate In-N-Out but it's superior to White Castle.\n",
      "Terrible burgers and fries. They taste worse than the microwavable ones. Their meat patties are disgusting, flavorless, and greasy. Not much to say because they don't offer much on their menu. Do not waste your money here.\n",
      "Okay, so Harold and Kumar are idiots? I don't get it? Little soggy sliders with mystery meat, a pickle and onions.... Maybe this is a midwest thing. But I just don't see the attraction. Very crowded so consider me one of the people who came to say they were there, but the food is plain and tasteless in my opinion. We ordered the combo #1 and split four sliders an order of fries and a 16 ounce soda. Total cost $8.64 and a waste of 30 minutes we can never get back... Skip this place, swing by any McDonald's in America and call it good! And by the way.... The movie wasn't good either....\n",
      "Where do I start Tami? Manager on duty August 7, 2016 at 2:25 pm. HAIR IN MY SLIDER?! Yummy!!! Unreal. The service by TAMI, ummmm... Training? Perhaps?! Didn't know hair was offered as a side to my burger! Thanks for making my poor daughter dig out the rest of the order from the trash to prove we weren't looking for a FREEBIE. NEVER AGAIN!!!! If they had a rating for NEGATIVE STARS, I'd be able to rate WHITE CASTLE!!! AKA \"HAIR CASTLE\"!\n",
      "At $1.29 per slider, a totally underwhelming bite. All i tasted was a mouthful of mince meat and onions. I've tried the frozen white castle burgers back in college, and I think those were more memorable. Skip this place, and save your belly for tastier Vegas eats.\n",
      "So happy they chose Las Vegas out of all the cities here in the West ! The burgers tasted just as I remembered when I was a kid back in the day ! The line tonight was not nearly as long as yesterday , and I was in within about 30 min or so ! I love yet another choice of burgers in town ... and for us that grew up with them it is a welcome sight ! Glad you are here White Castle and hope you can open more locations in town !\n",
      "White Castle goes one of two ways typically. People are either fanatics or hate it. Personally, I fall in the former category. Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger. And the toppings are minimal yet effective. For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken. In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well. Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case. I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30. Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember. These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?! I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed. And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge.\n",
      "Relatives from Chicago were right - definitely nothing special. Recommend everyone try it once to satisfy your curiosity, but the burgers are terribly bland, flavorless, limp, and unexciting. Drunk friends were not fans as well\n",
      "I have been waiting over 25 years to try a White Castle burger from a restaurant. I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store. The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new. Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety. But then again, it is fast food after all. I will eventually give this brand another chance in the mid-west.\n",
      "Tried White Castle for the first time at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest and thought they were decent. I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try. When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening. When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread. I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food. P.S. Get a beer! The way they serve it is pretty awesome.\n",
      "Had to come here after watching Harold & Kumar and was so excited they opened one up in the west coast. Came here before heading home from Vegas and I thought it was perfect for a hangover. It is fast food so don't expect anything fancy or high quality ingredients. Just greasy goodness on the go!\n",
      "So yeah. White Castle. Uhm it's a thing here now. Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade. I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers. Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones. The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done. To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet. At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution. Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time. We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though. We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro. Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then. Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way. He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section. They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant? It was fun. Everyone should try it at least once. I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though.\n",
      "First timer here... If it's good enough for Harold and Kumar to make a movie out of it, so had to try it. So basically the burgers are like sliders on Hawaiian type bread. Drunk and stoner food all the way dude! I liked the burgers, they come 4 in a combo pack. Why is there not one in So. Cal? Go figure... This area of the strip is kind of sketchy, although close to the High Roller.\n",
      "Mediocre place, tastes like something out of the freezer, microwaved to serve. This is definitely a hype. Oh, and Be careful eating here, as me and my bf spent days being sick on the toilet. Seems like we weren't the only ones.\n",
      "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge - 47/100 I had no idea these palm size burgers existed till I watched Harold and Kumar in the theater, 10+ years ago! Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers. Luckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market. Now that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them! I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan. It's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk. There are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip. The only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)\n",
      "I feel compelled to review this White Castle mainly because of the stream of slightly negative reviews. First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger. They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain. People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it. Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is. Simple. We went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV. The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it. Way less convenient for all others. We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected. Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins. I've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am. Yes, burgers for breakfast!! Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that. Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day. I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past. The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos. I'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast. There's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean. Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where. The set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving. While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around. The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward. I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line. Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long. We had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28. Just over a buck each which is standard. They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't. We have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed. These little suckers and simple and tasty. Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty. They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love. Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)! Average person can probably eat about 3-5. We had 10 each. Don't Judge!!! We weren't drunk or stoned. Fries are crinkle cut and crispy. Add some salt. Get one order fries for every 5 sliders. Bottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em. The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been. For Noobs, don't buy into the hype. Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap. Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right. These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees. Looking forward to having more next time I'm in town. Congrats Vegas! Lucky you.\n",
      "Got lucky and didn't wait long on a Saturday afternoon. First time but not impressed at all. Tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger but a little tastier but with a higher price tag. Definitely not worth the trip.\n",
      "For my first time I actually liked it!! Maybe only because I'm a burger person. If you enjoy just a simple type of burger this is the place\n",
      "I'm really disappointed with this White Castle location. The prices here are about 20+% marked up from a normal White Castle store, and the menu is also VERY limited. Pretty much regular burger, cheese burger and chicken rings, thats it! The lines can get really long here, but it does move pretty quickly, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Ultimately, the product is lacking. Don't let this be your first/only impression of White Castle, the east coast locations are great!\n",
      "From 7/24/15 We came here after a concert, and let me just say this White Castle is not like the ones I am used to in NY. Now, taking in account this location is on The Strip, I had to remind myself not to pick it apart for being overcrowded after all there are tons of hungry tourist to feed. Once you get your burgers, it's typical White Castle- cheap and delicious. I just hope they make one off The Strip for those of us who just want their burger goodness minus all the tourist.\n",
      "After hearing about White Castle since Harold and Kumar made it a thing, I was happy to learn there was one within reach in Vegas. After deciding to plan a mini-vacation to Vegas, my boyfriend's only request was to come here, so we did. Maybe this is one of those 'this is so good' when you're drunk type of places, because we just thought- meh. A solid \"it's okay\"-3 stars but nothing to text home about.\n",
      "Tucked in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard at the Casino Royale is a White Castle. Although prices were a little higher than other White Castles, it was a welcome price break from the more spendy food options on the Strip. The lines were long, but what other White Castle can you also buy beer? Enjoy the signature steamed square burger sliders, strongly flavored with chopped white onion. We particularly liked the fish slider which I thought was a cut above McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The crinkle fries were okay. 'Try the crunchy onion bits. Although it isn't fancy, White Castle sliders hit the spot when you need a bite when you are on a tight budget.\n",
      "I was so excited to come here when I found out it finally came that much closer to California. I've been wanting to come here since I saw the movie. Prior I had only had White Castle from the frozen section but frozen can never measure up to the freshly prepared sliders. So on my first night out in Vegas for my company's annual trip and after a jillion glasses of Rieslings later, my boss (who is from Detroit) took me and my co workers here. We walked all the way from New York New York! Since it was my first time going to a White Castle restaurant I kept it simple and ordered six sliders and fries. The sliders were even better than the packaged ones! I think is the the fresh onions that give the sliders that bang. However I would say the fries were nasty because they were hard and cold. I complained about it all night. There was no wait because we received our food pretty fast. Hey a drunk can't tell no tales. Lol Hopefully when I come back I will be in a more sober state of mind.\n",
      "It's White Castle....not my favorite but not bad when you're hungry. Overpriced steamed mini burgers that's all. The bread is always moist and soggy and the meat is just weird. The wait was over 20 minutes but hey it's on Las Vegas Blvd so I'm not expecting it to be quick. I'm not sure what the hype is but I'm not impressed.\n",
      "Growing up in the West, I've never really gotten to experience White Castle fresh. I've only experienced the frozen kind that you buy at your local markets. With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger, (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip. It's always busy and within one of the casino in Vegas.\n",
      "Never have been to this establishment ever before, I decided to give in and see what all of this hype about White Castle is all about ..... I honestly don't understand it ... You do get your order very quick and it's not expensive.... But they are just soo tiny! They taste okay, nothing that screams out go there again .....\n",
      "We literally had nothing better to do, so why the hell not. Got in line a little after 3pm on opening day. The line was long but very orderly, and moved consistently. Not as bad as Disneyland. The employees and volunteers were awesome. Everyone had a great attitude. It took about 40 mins to get to the front of the line, then once inside there was another small line of about 20 people deep. Right before we got inside, they started giving out free regular sliders as samples. I seriously thought about getting out of line after the sample. The beef is literally 1/8\" thick. It's $1.09 for a plain slider, $1.50 for one with cheese. You would have to layer probably three patties to get it the same thickness of say a $1 burger at McD's. Imagine if you ordered a $1 burger at a fast food place and got a White Castle style slider. You'd be pissed right? But people are lining up for these and buying them by the box! You can add on extra pickles or onions for no charge, otherwise there is only one pickle. No sauce either, but you can ask for ketchup, mayo, etc. They have $5 shakes too, but no bourbon in them. They didn't even fill it to the top! Food 1 star Value/price 1 star Service and employees 4 star Got to hang out with Nik O and say hi to Niyen 5 star Likeliness of my returning 0 star I've never had White Castle before, and now I can say I did. I don't get what the big deal is though. In N Out hands down.\n",
      "Oh yeah noting like white castles might need to stop by tomorrow not get and get some more\n",
      "I'm from LA and I've never tried White Castle before. I now see that I haven't missed a thing.\n",
      "Disappointing. White Castle was pretty hyped up for me thanks to my friends. As I was walking the strip looking for a place to eat, I stumbled across it and decided I might as well try it. I ordered a variety of things: onion rings, chicken nugget like things and two sliders. Onion rings, unfortunately these were the highlight of my meal....they were the best tasting thing I ordered and even then they were just okay. The chicken nuggets tasted very stale and were pretty small too. For reference I am a fan of McD's nuggets. The sliders were bad. They tasted like meat paste covered in onion inside a bun. I cringed while eating them and so did the friend I was with. At least their service is nice though?\n",
      "DONT FORGET TO ASK FOR CHEESE!!!! Besides that so much better then frozen if your from Chicago New York New Jersey or anyone of the states facings he Atlantic Ocean this should really bring back memories\n",
      "Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - 2/100 My friends and I wanted to kill some time before heading back to the hotel and getting ready for another night of clubbing, so we decided on stopping by White Castle for a food adventure. All I can say is the burger is mediocre, the soda is flat, and even the fries are underwhelming. If I were to name one thing that I could potentially eat... it would be the chicken rings. Still tasted a little plastic-y though.\n",
      "Do not expect the cheap prices you have back home, but do expect a classic White Castle experience on the Las Vegas Strip. The western most outpost of the east coast chain is at the Casino Royale between Harrah's and the Venetian. Veterans know what to expect. White Castle specializes in small burgers called sliders with a thin beef patty grilled in onions. You order several paired with fries or chicken rings, although I always recommend doubling down on the sliders as the fries are rather basic. The real value comes from the large packs of sliders. You can get a bag or case of them to take back to the room for a cheap price. The restaurant is nice to eat in with basic decorations and easy access. It's nice to see some east coast classics make their way to Las Vegas. White Castle is not the best burger on the strip, but it's comforting to have them as a fun option while visiting.\n",
      "I decided to go to Vegas with my friend one weekend and since i was here I decided to bring some white castle home for the family. I was staying at the palazzo so I decided to wake up extra early at 7am on a Sunday to stand in line to get some mini burgers. I arrived and was so excited that there was no line. Not even one person in front of me. I decided to order the crave case. It came with 30 sliders for $34.99. The workers are really fast at what they are doing and got me my case of sliders super fast. I took a bite and was really disappointed. It didn't have much flavors and the ones I have made at home were so much better than from the actually white castle. Overall, I will not be back. Not worth it. Try it and now I will try to forget about it.\n",
      "It's not gourmet food, but it IS a White Castle out here in the southwestern US! For pure nostalgia and novelty it gets at least 3 stars. The food is just how I remember it last time I had it driving through New Jersey. I got the yummy crinkle fries and those cheese sliders kissed with onion steam. Mmmm. The line went pretty quickly, and the cashier was friendly. Love the castle facade on the Strip! It's connected to the Best Western/Casino Royale's food court, which let's face it, is not the most stellar hotel/casino out here. I did go out of my way just for this food, but it was worth it to me. Again, just the fact that it's out here is worth a lot. Now I only have to drive 5 hours, not fly across the country, if I ever get another craving. :)\n",
      "I see a lot of bad ratings about this place and while I can see how some people might feel, I think they got it all wrong. I mean you can't compare it to anything else which some do talking about how you can get bigger better burgers. You don't come here for a double double, you don't come here for a 1/2 lb patty. These are White Castle sliders. This is what you come here for. These mini perfect two bite sliders steamed on a bed of onions. The next complaint I hear is about the price being more expensive then back east. This is the Las Vegas strip. It's not cheap to be here. Let them make their money. It's not insane. Meals are about $8-$10. A damn McDonald's meal can come out to almost $7 or $8 off the strip, give them a break! In fact it's the same price or maybe even a little cheaper than when it comes to the foodie festival and no one complains about that. And this is a legit White Castle. Not a truck just serving the sliders. The sliders are the real deal. The sides are good, small, but good. The service is impeccable. Even with long lines you get your food in 5-10 minutes. I got mines in 3. It's kept as clean as possible considering the crowd that comes through here. The bottom line is this is secured in my places to eat at and I'm more than thankful to have it so close to me. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the casino it's in, and the type of crowd that comes from that casino. You'll see what I mean. To get an idea, as I write this review, there have been literally thousands of people who have gone here and only 55 yelp reviews. So they're not exactly the courteous foodie type. But it's White Castle, and it's here, the farthest west it's ever been. Try it. Love it. Carry on.\n",
      "Not sure if lackluster taste or just sober. I've gone to White Castle locations in the East Coast a few years back and remember tasting the sweetness of caramelized onions with that salty square patty and having a huge smile on my face from the first slider to the last. This time around... not so much. Granted it is a fast food chain and not much should be expected but nonetheless I'm voicing a little disappointment. I'm sure after knocking a few back through the night this place would have been a godsend but not when I'm sober and chauffeuring people from out of town trying to explain that this chain had a whole movie revolving around it. The sliders do come somewhat neatly packed into their signature boxes and it's always a fun time when you take 20 of them to make a nice castle to DESTROY. We opted for half regular and half with cheese for this order. Fries were under-seasoned and kind of took me back to the days of my childhood eating cafeteria food... you know what... let's just call this experience that. Having White Castle on the Las Vegas strip in the early evening is like over-paying for the same $2.50 slider and fry combo you would buy at your school cafeteria during lunch. I wouldn't say it's terrible but it's not that great either. In our case, we went for the number 9* pack for 4 people and still left a bit hungry and our international friends very disappointed (sorry folks). *Drinks and cheese are extra\n",
      "No where like the ones in NYC. No fish sandwich or clam strips. Chocolate shake was almost 6 bucks too. Which brings me to the fact that the sliders in Vegas are about 45 cents more than the east coast which doesn't surprise me. Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains. Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet. Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders. Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference. The \" good ole boys\" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about \" no state income tax\" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees. Point is .....ignorance is bliss. If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy. Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here. Then again, they'll probably fuck those up too and charge 40% more for them since we're sitting in this \" rock quarry\" called Las Vegas.\n",
      "We came here for a midnight snack post Blueman show. This place was busy! Waited in line for 5 minutes and decided to order combo #2- 4 White Castle cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink. The very friendly attendant recommended the onion chips instead of their regular crinkle cut fries. Great recommendation! It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun.\n",
      "I was pretty excited to try White Castle and I was a little shocked to see Vegas had a location. I had no idea what to expect as I only knew of White Castle through H&K so I went in with an open mind. The line to the register wasn't horribly long and it gave me enough time to look up at the menu. Since I only wanted to try the burgers I just went for a very small meal option that consisted of a burger and fries.\n",
      "I was so disappointed in this place. We had the sliders for a late night snack. They were not tasty. The onion rings were better than the fries.\n",
      "We're from San Diego, so my boyfriend was eager to eat White Castle that wasn't out of a food truck----it tasted the same lol. I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha. Taste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food. White Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from. I'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least.\n",
      "Very over priced for such a small amount of food. No cheese sticks. Rip off. Go elsewhere. Not good.\n",
      "I was hoping it would be White Castle, with all the things that encompasses - the burgers, the smells, the fun, the other food items, etc. I waited till the lines were reasonable and they could get in their groove. Well their groove wasn't so groovy. One of the best things about their slider is how the bun melts a little into the hot burger. For whatever reason they weren't nearly as hot as they should be. Lost the flavor and the smell. A $5+ dollar shake, each burger was 50 cents over regular WC's and not as good, it wasn't a place were you were eating fun for a few bucks anymore. I'll wait till I'm back in NY for my next one. Didn't want to be disappointed but . . . If you're familiar with White Castle and love them, you won't want to get familiar with this one. Keep the memory of how they were.\n",
      "Sunday May 28th 2017 at 10:54 PM. *This my first time ever going to write castle.* The line was about about a 20 minute wait which was really low wait. This place can be really packed at times. Try going later or really early if you don't want a line wrapped around the building outside. There's very little sitting and just be really friendly with other diners. We sat near a gentleman from LA in town for a concert. We chatted before his food came out. He bought one of everything on the menu which I realized was accurately smart. He ate his food and didn't even touch his bacon cheese fries, he was so full he gave us the bacon cheese fries. We were so full after we left and it pays to be friendly with neighboring people. We had a number #7 ten sliders pack, cheese was a $3 up charge. I think I had 5 little cheese sliders they had pickles and onions. It was a surprise they have a 10% locals discount!!! Now serving breakfast MIDNIGHT until 11 AM!!!\n",
      "This might sound silly to some but I have never had White Castle and always wanted to but somehow on all my trips across the country I always missed going to one. Finally made it to one in Las Vegas and for a late night snack it was good. Simple yet good. Nothing else really tastes like it. Just do it if in Vegas from CA its the nearest one to us on the west coast I guess.\n",
      "hecky no, &12.00 for 10 burgers. no way, however on a wed. nite easy available parking in the rear....and why do they need 3 burly security guards standing around staring at you, is somebody gonna get shot? No W.C. I am not paying your damn rent, ..rippoff, they are 45cents each back east, . Purchased 2 full sacks got home and it was cruddy old meat that they had under lights or had just reheated, crusty on the edges and old. DONT SELL ME-your old GARBAGE PLEASE... very dissapointed. buy the one in the store, youre better off.\n",
      "Could you have put this in a worst location for locals. Hard to get to, middle of the strip. Virtually no parking. Build more OFF THE STRIP.\n",
      "Hmm. As a native Chicagoan, I was STOKED to find out there was a White Castle in Vegas when I planned our last trip. This one wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't wasn't the same as the ones back home. They were tasty, and not bad at all, but they just tasted like the boxed ones that you can pick up at Vons, only with someone else heating them up for you. I'd come back while drunk or on a craving, but for an authentic White Castle burger it looks like I'll be catching a flight from LAX back to O'Hare.\n",
      "Little burgers, in a square box Little burgers, made with beef, onions and a pickle Little burgers, in a square box Little burgers all the same. Because of the novelty expect to pay at least $9.00; a meal that includes four sliders, fries and drink.\n",
      "Growing up in Texas, we have always had the frozen White Castle burgers in grocery stores but never the actual castles. For some reason, the frozen white castle burgers have always been incredibly delicious to me. Disclaimer: I am no burger aficionado. I'm a simple girl, I can have a meal consist of frozen foods and be happy. I've always wanted to go to the actual White Castle after obviously being inspired by Harold and Kumar and I'm glad there's a location in Vegas for me to finally check out. The burgers taste exactly the same as the freezer burgers except the \"fresh\" ones have pickles. I can rest easy now that I can continue buying the freezer burgers back home and know that it does not taste any different from those at the actual White Castle. The onion chips are addicting as well. I would opt for those over the crinkle-cut fries.\n",
      "I wasn't impressed with White Castle's food. The slides had more bread than meat, no flavor, and the fries were something you could buy from the local grocery store. I was impressed with how fast they moved us through the long line and how they served the beer.\n",
      "It's a 2...because we didn't spit it out LOL. That's a good start, right? Makes your mouth water? It also gets a 2 instead of a 1 because it was very organized. The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food. So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay! We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better! We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way. We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew. The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible. This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there. I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things. Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew. In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!\n",
      "Taste just like old times to me. Prices are different because it's on the strip. But nice friendly service\n",
      "Not sure what all the HYPE about White Castle is all about. You can get a way better burger for cheaper at Shack Shake, Steak N Shake, Fatburger, or even McDonalds, if you want a late night meal, Del Taco is better than White Castle. I think people rate it in the nostalgia feeling and the memories, because it's totally not worth it. The line did move fast and it was clean, but based on taste, no way. You're in Vegas, were you can get a gourmet burger for $6.99 (at Flemings Steakhouse) or a decent burger at local bars for the same price.\n",
      "2/26- So I reached out to WC that day regarding the mistake in my order and have yet to receive a response. Apparently customer service isn't that important when you're selling thousands of hamburgers a day. ________ Being originally from Chicago, I've been dying to get here, but wanted to wait until the craziness died down. I finally made it over for lunch at Noon. Believe it or not, my wait was only about 5 minutes. Yes, they were busy (and the line grew for lunchtime as I was there), but still not the hours it was when it opened. It's definitely more expensive than the typical WC, but understandable both being on the Strip & delivering the food from the Midwest. With that said, the burgers & onion ri..., er, chips are how I remembered--fantastic. The frozen ones in the stores don't even compare. The workers were friendly & the place clean. However they did forget my wife's chicken rings; and considering it's overpriced & I live 15 miles away, that's an issue. Regardless, I know I'll return when I get the crave\n",
      "Food and speed of service gets a solid 5 stars. Manny the security guard gets a -5 stars resulting in a score of 1. Manny should not work with customers.\n",
      "It's exactly what I expected. It's worth 4 stars for not having to fly east for fresh sliders. Price is a little higher than normal and I wish they had the jalapeno cheese burger. Still happy they're here.\n",
      "Best Sliders by far. I'm not sure how some people can write a bad review on these burgers. I'm from the Midwest and live in Vegas and these are just the same as back home. I guess you have to have an home town love for these belly bombers to appreciate them. I feel bad for all the haters out there that had high expectations after watching some dumb movie. I will return again and again.\n",
      "I've heard of White Castle and I've seen them in the freezer section at my local supermarket. Now they've got one on the Strip. The five of us dropped in for a snack following a show at the Venetian. Queued up and looked at overhanging menu posted above. Combo pack = 10 burgers, two fountain drinks, and two orders of fries could satisfy our palates. The order taker asked if we wanted cheese. O.k. Total came to about $24.00. Almost $5.00 per person for a what we got didn't seem worth it to me. I'll pass next time. But those are the kind of prices even for junk food in Vegas. Mystery burger meat shaped thin and square. The chopped onions and the pickle made up for it. Soft burger bun. Maybe two to four bites depending on your bite. Served in individual cardboard boxes. I say save money and use paper. Need to be more eco friendly. The kitchen was working hard. Look over the counter and you'll see the assembly line. And another mentally challenged person who popped himself at our table. Talking and mumbling to himself. First in Phoenix and now in Vegas.\n",
      "So glad to have The Castle in Vegas. Other than the parking situation for us locals, it is on the money. Was a bit disappointed on my first visit(I think the employees were still learning), however all the rest were just right. This is not gourmet, it's fast food. I could eat those cheese sliders morning, noon, or night. Thank You White Castle!!!\n",
      "Food was good not as I expected to be but it's ok . Cashier was nice but Shelly \"old lady\" super rude looked at me as if I was some kind of cereal killer or something . Can't believe it I've never felt so offended in my life getting fast food\n",
      "Great food of course! Place is Awesome! The staff is friendly. Will definitely make this a must visit whenever I come to Vegas. It is a new must go place for me and my family. We actually waited in line two different days.\n",
      "I got caught up in the hype of wanting to try this out. I've had a frozen white castle burger a long time ago. It was alright. Coming here today and consuming their food I've come to the conclusion this place is an acquired taste. The cheese slider #2 combo with fries comes with grilled onions and a pickle inside the sliders. If I had a choice between In n Out or Smashburgers I would choose those 2 over this. I didn't think the food was at the level of quality of other burger joints I've eaten at. I recommend trying this place out at least once and let your taste buds decide if its worthy. Or to at least say you've eaten at a white castle.\n",
      "Boyfriend and I were sick for 2 days. My stomach was still not right after eating here and for 2 weeks I had issues. I am finally feeling better but wow, I will never crave this place ever again.\n",
      "Not my cup of tea. Service was fast and friendly, but the burgers were gross maybe I'm just used to things like in n out.... This burger was terrible!\n",
      "Delicious! The burgers are amazing and super cute! So happy they have a location in Vegas now!!!! Definitely a must when you visit the Vegas Strip!!!\n",
      "Okay so a White Castle in the east coast for 60 cents a slider would have a little more appeal. But at 1.20 a slider in the west coast? No appeal what so ever. Even a hamburger at nasty McDonald's would be cheaper and more flavorful. The sliders are literally the size of a half dollar coin, and takes less than a bite to eat. Like you read in the other reviews, the meat is paper thin, our sliders had barely any grilled onions in it, and the bread was soggy. It tasted like literally paper. If it was actually the same prices of the east coast white castles then I could see the appeal in getting filled by buying like a million sliders for cheap although you're wasting it on eating a pile of flavorless junk.\n",
      "Nothing special except that the prices are way higher than the East coast White Castles! Well, duh Vegas!!! Ordered the #2 combo. It comes with 4 cheeseburger sliders , fries and a drink for $8.99. I really thought i was going to finish all that by myself, but i was wrong!! Definitely, come here if you want to what the big hype is. If you can't, Frozen version from the supermarket is not so much of a difference!\n",
      "White Castle, it finally exists in Las Vegas. No longer do you need to fly out to the east coast 4 hours away or eat microwavable frozen white castle from the grocery. Harold and Kumar can finally get their fix in Sin City. While the location in Best Western Hotel is a little bit awkward, it's also quite convenient being that there is parking in the back. I came here in the morning before heading back out to Los Angeles. The staff was in full force and looked like they were ready for a big crowd to come through. I might have been one of the first people to walk in that day so my order was very quick considering that I ordered a crave case.\n",
      "I think just like everybody else, I wanted to try this place after watching the movie Harold and Kumar. 11 years later, finally made it here. For some reason, could not locate it in New York, but found it in Vegas. Saw people taking pictures here. It's actually really good. Surpassed my expectations. Got the mini cheese sliders. It's really good. Fresh and lots of flavor. I love the onions baked into the meat. It's so much better than the ones sold frozen in the grocery aisle. The bad is the long line, long wait, and price. However, would definitely return.\n",
      "It's always busy here, but to me, it's worth the wait. Every time we are in Vegas we make a stop for White Castle. This time I tried the onion chips and loved them. Burgers are always good. I wish they had one in my city. Maybe one day.\n",
      "Yeah, that's right, I love White Castle. It's nostalgia for me. I feel like a kid in Chicago again every time I bite into one of those tiny littler cheeseburgers. This spot is on the Strip (next to Walgreens and the Venetian). It's open 24/7. And they serve alcohol too (duh, it's Vegas!). The staff are always friendly and nice. When it's packed, it can sometimes take awhile to get your order. But most often, your order comes up pretty quick. Personally, I always opt for one of the meal deals - usually the one with 4 sliders. Both the fries and fried onion thingys are decent choices. It's also pretty fun people-watching when you come here at like 3am on a weekend.\n",
      "Came here expecting to be Amazed with a White Castle burger with my gf it was freezing cold in LV but I was determined to get a White Castle burger after seeing Harry and Kulmar (movie).I walk in wait in line place my order and I wait.They call my number I rush to the counter I even ordered cheese!I sat took a bite and was so disappointed.The microwave WC burgers were better than the actual.Never will I come back in the freezing cold.Bad experience indeed.\n",
      "Decent. Expected more but decent Forsure. I don't wanna say overrated but Yelp wouldn't let me leave it at decent ( words min.) so now that I think about it I'm leaning towards overrated.\n",
      "White Castle is a place where you should definitely try in Las Vegas. The sliders are pretty good even though it tastes like Mcdonald's cheeseburgers. I ordered 30 to bring back to San Jose and it comes in a case so you can carry it. So convenient. The sliders are small so if you're extremely hungry, 1 would definitely not fill you up.\n",
      "Come to experience it, but don't expect much at all. It's cool to see all the sliders out on the grill but in all honesty, they taste better from the frozen dinner section. Their fries were better than the sliders.\n",
      "As a 12 year old boy, my friends and I were obsessed with Harold and Kumar and I mean OBSESSED. We'd watch it every single week after our Sunday league soccer games and always dreamed of going on a road trip to get 100's of those tasty looking little sliders. Unfortunately, that dream never did come true but 12 years later the reminiscing angels opened up the heavens and decided to let the King and Queen of White Castle land one of their castles on the Las Vegas strip!! Hallelujah right??! ....OH... HELL.... NO! The spot is located inside the Casino Royale Hotel, right across the street from the Mirage so it's pretty centrally located. It wasn't too busy when we went but it seems like the line goes very fast any ways. Maybe sipping on a fruity Phat Tuesday at the same time as ordering wasn't the brightest idea but either way the food here is absolutely disgusting. I was EXTREMELY excited...remembering almost every line from Harold and Kumar as I waited for my food to be ready to grab. That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard. I now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE.\n",
      "Friendly staff. Expensive food. Not at all that good either. My bread was so soggy on my incredibly small little hamburgers... the only good thing was the fries.\n",
      "I'm sorry Roldy and Kumar, but this crap is horrible. I pictured this place being an east coast In N Out in slider form, but the burgers were horrible. Love the movie, hate the product.\n",
      "I've heard the White Castles in the East Coast tastes a lot better and I sure hope that's the case because the sliders that I've gotten this past weekend here was not good. The lines are about 20 minutes long and the sliders were similar to the ones you get in the frozen food section. Pretty disappointed in this place but I already expected it. The sliders looked like they were just slapped together. The only thing I liked about it was that they came in mini boxes. The meat was small and mysterious. We picked up a bag of hot cheetos to put it in our sliders to cover up the taste and it worked. I got the Combo #2 (~$8.99) which includes 4 cheese sliders, fries and a soda. Next time I'll pass on this. Overall, will not come back to this location. I would give White Castle another try but in the East Coast.\n",
      "We got through the line really fast and the service was great. I wish I had ordered more. The burger was great fresh but almost tasted the same as the frozen ones you can buy at the grocery store. I was just happy to see an actual White Castle.\n",
      "If I could compare the burgers they're pretty much the exact same ones from the freezer section at any grocery store. Unless I was hungover or drunk I'd probably refrain from coming back. Service was great though!\n",
      "My husband and daughter enjoyed the burgers. I thought the chicken rings were tender and tasted okay. Chocolate shake was good. We came at a good time and there was only one person in front of us. Fast and cheap food. Glad they opened a chain here in the west coast.\n",
      "I have been a white castle fan since birth in Chicago. I went to this location twice once on April 7th and again on April 8th. Both times I got sick after eating the double cheese burger, this never ever happens to me. The staff was very nice and the wait was short so everything should have been 5 star, but something is wrong here and I could not figure out what is was. Also it would be nice if they had security until 4am there, some of the customers are nut jobs.\n",
      "Wow. At least I can say I've knocked White Castle of my bucket list. Even though they make the burgers \"fresh\", I can pretty much say there isn't much difference in taste between these and the frozen ones you can get at the grocery store. The \"beef\" quality is right up there with Taco Bell's mystery beef, no bueno. A 10 pack was like $10. I had two burgers back at my hotel and didn't even finish the rest. Thanks for the hype Harold and Kumar!! Ya'll should have went to In-N-Out!\n",
      "Never had them before but heard about them. This was a must try. So can here at 2am and it was super packed. Well it's located in the middle of the Vegas strip which is why it's crazy busy in there. So ordered the cheese burger combo number 2. The party is thin and the look of it was different from the kind of patty I am used to look at. Bun was soft but from the heat and being in a paper box and it was a bit too soft or bit soggy. Fries were awesome, they tasted so good. I would come here again maybe. But I am not a big fan of their sliders. Not sure what's the hype.\n",
      "MURDER BURGERS, OH HOW IVE MISSED YOU!! Anyone who has ever eaten a White Castle burger KNOWS they are murder on your stomach, but they are UHMAZING. (Duh, Haven't you ever seen Harold & Kumar, and the lengths they went to just to get a damn slider). Anywho, I have only been able to eat these little suckers from the frozen food section since moving from NY so it was nice to see (and eat) fresh burgers from the stand. This was the first placed I stopped at and they brought back nostalgia. Chicken Rings, Cheese burger, fries and AGITA (thats HEARTBURN) It didnt get 5 stars because the prices are INSANE. Also, to make your burgers LESS murderous on your intestines, Order them WITHOUT onions. That's the key :)\n",
      "I love these one- and two-star reviews from people who just don't get what the White Castle experience is supposed to be about. What were you expecting? This ain't In-N-Out. My only beef with this place - no pun intended, but I could have deleted it and used another phrase if I really wanted to - is that they serve onion chips, which are whole chunks of onion covered in bread crumbs, instead of onion rings, which are built around processed, probably reconstituted onions. It's a nod to quality but I miss the old school rings. And of course now I want White Castle. The crave is too real.\n",
      "Crave those crazy squares!! Not breakfast cereal, White Castle burgers! If you didn't grow up with this chain, you don't get it. Yeah, the meat is a super-thin mystery but it's a nostalgia thing, there's nothing like the WC flavor. Summers in Ohio with my cousins would always end with a trip here. Back home in Texas, my dad would crave them and have to settle for the frozen-aisle version. Finally, Vegas got an outpost! The prices are jacked up for the Strip location but the taste is all 1994. It really is a trip to finally be able to taste real White Castle burgers again: hot, fresh, crusted in onion bits and topped with a single pickle. You gotta get them with cheese for the full effect. Add ketchup at your own risk! Service is pretty organized: the kitchen is open and everyone is working hard, order numbers are both called out and posted on a screen. Somehow I got skipped, but they remade my order and tossed in dessert, too.\n",
      "Well, White Castle kind of is what it is... I don't think people come here thinking they're gonna get a gourmet burger or anything like that. White Castle is one of those late night craving fixers that used to not exist in the western USA, leave it to Vegas to make it happen. This place is a bit of a show in the middle of the night as most people are drunk and sloppy while ordering lol. The food itself is as expected, small but tasty, usually takes 4-5 of these bad boys to get you full. This is likely the only reason to go into the Casino Royale, as it is located within. Overall, recommend as a late night novelty fix, not necessarily if you're looking for a delicious burger. Pros- Price Beer price Only one in western U.S. Plenty of seating Center of the strip Cons- Average food A bit of a novelty burger Messy Cleanliness\n",
      "My fiance wanted to come to white castle to try the food as it was on his list of things to do before he dies due to the movie Harold and Kumar go to white castle. He thought they looked good and he did not want to try the frozen ones as he wanted the authentic experience. They were such a waste of money and calories! We got the 10 pack of hamburgers for $11, and a large fries for $2.95 which would of been the same as getting a number #1 and 2 extras for myself and come out with less food. We waited 30 minutes for our food and when we got it and ate it, we were so unsatisfied with the flavor. IT tasted just like onions, thats it! so overpowering. Will not go back! Do not suggest.\n",
      "A short walk north of The Linq is the brand new White Castle location. It opened on January 27, 2015 next to Casino Royale has been busy ever since. The only time I could get a White Castle was when I was in Chicago for a tradeshow. I simply had to hit the Vegas location up for these tasty little sliders. Loaded Fries are topped with cheese sauce, ranch, and bacon. I love the crinkle cut fries which holds the sauce and toppings really well. Nothing better than cheesy fries, unless they are topped with chili too. Rating: 5/5 Double Original Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with onions and pickle. Patties are steam grilled with the onions which adds more flavor to the patty. The buns are put on top to steam as well. The whole slider is just juicy and soft. There are imitators but this is the original! Rating: 3/5 Double Cheese Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with cheese, onions, and pickle. When I bit into the first one, I was in foodie heaven. There is nothing like the juicy beef flavor with the grilled onions and gooey cheese. I was being good, but I could have easily eaten a couple more of these. Rating: 5/5\n",
      "I have liked White Castle since my childhood in Ohio. It is great to have it here on the Strip and the doubles are great except for one thing...the cheese tastes slightly different than the White Castles back in the Midwest.\n",
      "I hate onions. But White Castle burgers are the only things I'll eat them on. AND their onion fries. That place was heaven. I bet it tastes like magic when you're drunk and/or high... The chicken rings were pretty good too. Not a fan of cheese on my chicken, but the portion was perfect.\n",
      "I love having White Castle every time I'm in vegas. The portion isn't crazy like most foods (depending on what you order of course) and it's the perfect food for those late night munchies. The service is decent and the food comes out quickly which is great. Definitely worth giving a try!\n",
      "It was my first time at a White Castle, and after eating four sliders and loaded fries I felt sick. Not sick in a \"yuck\" way, but in a \"wow this hit the spot but it's really bad for me and now I feel like a bloated manatee.\" If you don't mind that feeling (at least for a couple of hours afterwards), go to White Castle. (I'm sure I'll be back at some point!)\n",
      "We had to try this place...I've been to one back east, but that was in the early 80s. If nice then, all we get to have is the frozen ones. I must admit, I enjoy the frozen ones more cause they're moist and seemed to have more flavor than the ones at the Vegas spot. Didn't like the fries...but ok for a quick bite.\n",
      "Service was slow but it was the only thing opened at 3am even though they had a full staff. The guy who was handing us out food looked like he had no desire to be there.\n",
      "Had White Castle before but this one was a bit different. Me and some pals bought a 30 pack of burgers. They were tasty but two hours later all three of us sounded like a trumpet symphony!\n",
      "Came to Vegas for my friend's wedding and was very excited to find a white castle on the strip. Stopped on the way to the airport to bring some sliders back to Florida for my brother. My bf ran in and ordered 30 sliders to share with the family. We were highly disappointed after paying for 30 sliders to open the bag once we got on the road to find only 16 in the bag. The same great white castle taste is there, but we missed out on half of our order. I tried for over 30 minutes while waiting at the airport to contact the manager without success. I finally called the hotel to get a direct line and receieved a voice message box that was full. What a huge disappointment!\n",
      "Located inside the Casino Royale Hotel & Casino. Get the loaded fries along with your sliders. Warning, i've seen this line go 40 deep at times.\n",
      "I thought the burger would be like a regular burger but it was much smaller. Thanks to my friend for pointing it out for me, otherwise, I would still be starving because I originally wanted two burgers haha. The location is a little bit hard to see from a glance. We didn't know where it was until we yelped this location. Price was decent. Not something I would buy again and again. The burger itself is actually pretty good. It was a good experience for me!\n",
      "3 Stars is an \"A-OK\" We got a bunch of the single sliders, had a few and they were okay. You either hate these or like them, I highly doubt anyone LOVES these burgers. I wanted to get these because it's been about 20 years since I moved to California where there are no White Castles. I almost forgot about this business until Harold and Kumar came along and I got the frozen ones a few times a year. I actually liked their sliders as a kid...obviously they look much tinier now. Anyway, we didn't like them enough to eat the 8 we got (I consider 4 of them as an equivalent to one normal burger) We took it back to our hotel room and I chucked the remainder in the freezer....I got hungry the next day and decided to microwave one up for 40 seconds....Maybe it's just me, but it tasted better after the freezer. For those people complaining about the patty's color, it's because of the way it's made, doesn't mean the meat is inferior (most fast food patties are all roughly the same quality). They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color. Meat only gets brown if it's directly on the cooking surface.\n",
      "Just like back east!! There was a super short line around 6pm and the woman taking our order was very friendly. Plus, there's a little bit of a discount for locals. If you've tried the little burgers from the frozen section of a grocery store, you have to try these - infinitely​ better. And if you've been drinking, definitely buy them by the sack like the sign says ;)\n",
      "The burgers were a huge disappointment. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The smell of the burger was nauseating and the meat was bland. Not sure why people like this.\n",
      "I line was long but it went quick.. The food was hot and it was good. I haven't had White Castle in years since I'm from California. I loved the bottoms up beer.. How cool was that.. It's a must try for sure..\n",
      "I had high expectations for White Castle because my friend kept talking about wanting to eat here while we were planning our Vegas trip. I thought it would taste better but the sliders literally taste like the frozen ones that you can make at home. The only difference is that they add pickles. It makes me wonder if they just reheat the frozen ones and serve it. I guess this is a nice place for drunchies but I wouldn't crave for it. The meals are also pretty pricey. I'd settle for the frozen ones.\n",
      "White castle burgers are good if you only eat 1. 2 or more and you start feeling greasy and sick. I ate four and i was woozy for about a day or so. Overall okay place, service was friendly, location is odd parking sucks. Probably will never come back again.\n",
      "I have been to Vegas more times than I can count, and I finally got the chance to try the legendary White Castle on my last trip. I honestly wasn't expecting much. I feel like when places like this are talked about so much the food is generally mediocre. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try as a late night snack. We got there around 11 and there was a huge line. The wait was not bad at all though. The line looks long, but they make the burgers pretty quick so it goes by really fast. I opted for two of their original cheese sliders and they came out really quick. The burgers are really small so I understand why they have such huge combos. I am normally a person who doesn't eat much and I think I could eat about 4 sliders. The patty is really thin and that is what makes the sliders stand out. There was nothing special about them, but they were the perfect late night snack. I will probably be back here when I am in Vegas and craving a light snack in the middle of the night since they are open 24hrs. I am curious about how their other sliders and fries taste like so I might revisit the next time I visit Vegas in July. With so many food choices near by, White Castle would probably not be the first place that comes to my mind when I want a full meal. Overall, White Castle is A-OK in my book.\n",
      "For those like ourselves that don't live anywhere near a WC and have to make do by eating the frozen ones from the grocery store, this was a godsend. We got five burgers each, and some couldn't eat all of theirs. Good cheap food, and as good as I remember them back east.\n",
      "I wouldn't have it any other way. I showed up drunk at 3 am. Shady characters walking around. I ordered many items... Do they deserve a Michelin star? No but then again whats the reason we all come here? Harold and Kumar right? Its fast food people. What did you expect?\n",
      "Having never been to a White Castle location I had to visit this one. Umm...it was what I expected, less than average. I really have nothing more to add.\n",
      "What a disappointment! I was really looking forward to eating here... I was first introduced to White Castle from my local freezer section when I was a child. Those little hamburger / cheeseburgers were delicious! Even as an adult now I would pick up a box from the freezer section from time to time. So naturally I would assume freshly made would taste better than the freezer section. Sadly this was not the case. I'm not really sure how to describe it... the sliders were actually bland and soggy. And the smell / stench... I'm not sure where it was coming from. Either the casino or the actual \"restaurant\" (the White Castle is located in the casino; open space) or a combination of both... but it was unpleasant! We quickly ate the sliders so we can get out of there as fast as we can. Placing the order and picking up the food went very smoothly and quickly. The cashier and the lady that handed me the food was also very polite. So no complaints about that. Absolutely skip this location and satisfy your White Castle slider cravings for your local freezer section!\n",
      "Ugh. We literally ate raw beef yesterday and we were fine... But White Castle made us sick! Can't go anywhere because I have to be within a five feet radius of a toilet. Kind of ruined my last night in Vegas! Don't go here if you can help it.\n",
      "I am being generous with 2 stars. So disappointed. Growing up in NY and LI, I've had White Castle so many times and I usually enjoy it. Today, not so much. I suppose it was because I wasn't drunk. I also suppose it's when you charge me 3.19 for a double cheeseburger. So, 30 double doubles (that was for 6 people) and it cost $110, yes, ONE HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS!!!! Go F yourself! I get that it's the strip and it's going to be expensive but come on. Get real! I was extremely disappointed and won't return, even if I am drunk!\n",
      "Yes they have come to the strip, yes they are exactly what one would expect of a White Castle! Those steamy little hole filled burgers with those delicate little onions and that single pickle chip! To some they are a taste of pure heaven, others don't get the hype, I run the in between! I love the little buggers, but I'm not exactly a craver! This location does a decent enough job of preparing them, and they sell beer! However they are priced considerably higher due to it being on the Strip! Hence my 3 star rating! If you crave em, get em, if you love em get em, and if you just don't get the hype, In-N-Out is just down the street a ways, as is Shake Shack! Recommended if you're in the area!\n",
      "Came here for EDC weekend and the wait was crazy long! I believe I wanted for around 2 hours. This place is perfect for midnight munchies because it's open 24/7. You can order combos or the items separately. I got the jalapeño burger with white cheese pickles and onions, a cheeseburger, and the loaded fries. I felt that the burgers tasted subpar at best and for sure I've had better. But if you're getting fast food style sliders these will somewhat hit the spot. The fries were a bit salty for me so I'm not really a fan. Don't forget to get condiments. They don't provide them to you so you have to ask for it. I would recommend the Düsseldorf mustard. To me it's a bit spicier than regular mustard. Also they have \"swag\" aka souvenirs that you can purchase and if you like beer they do have alcohol at this location. TL;DR Don't expect fancy ass burgers for a fast food slider place. Keep in mind these guys have to make even 100 sliders for just one or many orders. Also it is a bit pricy here so order wisely.\n",
      "We went here for a snack. Overall it is a cheap one at a run down casino,casino royale. We ordered the fish sandwich slider and the cheese burger ones to tie us over. Overall, it was great for a snack as it is not big and full of bread.The place was clean however and appearance held up.\n",
      "This was my first time coming to White Castle in Las Vegas it was alright. The hype is just all it is \"HYPE\" nothing special, just something different. We don't have many options in Vegas for Sliders so this could be a main destination on your list. Location is kind of goofy and not very accessible to the local folk would like to grab a quick bite. You have to find some where to park on the strip and walk which is fine, but like I stated quick bite it isn't happening. Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus. Overall good spot for the Tourists and the tipsy crowd walking by.\n",
      "Let's get this out of the way: this is not a foodie destination whatsoever. However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history. I was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite \"the real thing.\" I parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the \"White Castle\" door. The menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a \"Crave Case\" of 30 sliders with friends/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda. In light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here. As I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders. Look, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group.\n",
      "White Castle had been on my bucket list for years. When I heard they recently opened a location in Vegas my smile grew big as I bookmarked it and forgot about it for a few months. We decided to head out to Vegas last weekend sporadically and I knew I had to find it on the strip and try it. Luckily, without planning our hotel was not too far from the White Castle that we stumbled upon our first night in town casino hopping. It is located inside the Royale Casino, which was another amazing find (cheap drinks), but that will be another review. We got in a long line and waited eagerly. We ordered a number 9 which included 20 original sliders and 2 regular French fries for $25.99. We added cheese and the total was around $35. Amanda took our order. She was patient, polite, and informative on our questions. Give Amanda a raise. We took our booty back to our room and began to pig out after a long night. I was surprised to bite into pickles on the burgers. Prior, I had only tried the frozen White Castle burgers, no pickles came on them. After the two of us devoured all we could we quickly realized that we had ordered way too much food for two people. There were MANY burgers left over. I am glad I checked this one off my list, and didn't have to travel to the East Coast to do so. It was not the best food but for being hungry in Vegas it hit the spot. *The french fries were not good at all. Wish we had tried another side instead.\n",
      "Not that great. Never been there and wasn't sure what to expect but as a self proclaimed burger snob this place is more along the line of Mc Donald's. Since I no longer eat at Mickey D's I probably would not come here again either. Chicken was dry and the burger had too much onions on them. However it was clean and food was hot.\n",
      "So good Put away eight sliders and you'll be a happy camper Tastes just like the Midwest (and not the frozen garbage from the store) My favorite fast food burgers after In N Out\n",
      "Got there around 3 and the line went by pretty quickly. Order the 2 double sliders with cheese meal and chicken rings (since everyone suggested to do so). Since they're sliders I suspected that they'd be small which was why I ordered two. The sliders come with grilled onions and pickles inside just an FYI if you don't like those stuff. You can see the chefs in the back cooking and boxing all the orders so I would say it's not exactly \"fresh\" because they're just constantly making the same thing over and over again. The chicken rings were good, they were like thinner chicken nuggets in a ring shaped form. Overall, this place was nothing special. Never been to the east coast to try the legit thing nor have I tried the frozen boxed one. At least the workers were nice and efficient.\n",
      "White Castle is definitely overhype for what it's worth or maybe I came during the wrong time. You get a lot of food in your meal but it taste like your average fast food that you can easily get from any fast food restaurant. Some of the employees seem very impatient but you can't really expect much from a fast food restaurant that's always packed. It is worth the experience in Vegas to say the least. If I'm starving at 3 or 4 in the morning with no other option the next time I visit Vegas, I might give it a second chance?\n",
      "You would do better going and getting a 16 box of the frozen White Castle burgers for $10. I'm from Detroit and it just didn't taste the same and it's over priced\n",
      "I grew up in the east and already loved White Castle. They make the burgers in front of you. the service was speedy. The restaurant connects to a casino so you can gamble or have an adult beverage with your sliders.\n",
      "Everyone always says it so good maybe if i was drunk id like it but it just wasnt happening for me :( i was a lil disappointed the wait was a lil long the fries were cold and had no flavor and the burgers were soggy it was too much bread :(\n",
      "i am so happy!! I am from michigan and every time I go home i go get white castle. It did not take too long and it was still as delicious as I was growing up. I am so glad that they finally opened one up on the strip. Still the best, i had it twice!!\n",
      "I love White Castle!! I used to go in Ohio when I was a kid, and had since resorted to buying the overpriced packages in the freezer section of my grocery store. I was so excited to hit up an actual White Castle location again. I ordered a good amount of sliders and a drink, and was no disappointed at all! Food took a while to come because it was really busy, but so worth it. Must stop here on your Vegas trip!\n",
      "Another Harold & Kumar fan checking in. Glad to finally cross White Castle off my bucket list. Still not really sure how I feel about it though. All of my bodily senses tell me I shouldn't like it. I mean, the famous sliders were soggy and tasteless, and yet I came away from it all kinda enjoying the experience. In a way, I can understand the appeal. If you're completely famished, it's easier to stuff yourself with White Castle sliders than with any other fast food burger precisely because of the very traits that make it so unappealing to foodies. Dunno if I'll ever come back, but regardless of all the bad reviews anyone who liked Harold and Kumar owes it to themselves to try the food at least once.\n",
      "I surprisingly enjoyed my first ever White Castle. First I'd like to say I'm not a fan of fast food chains. I eat at a drive through fast food chain maybe 5 times a year tops when I have absolutely no other option on a road trip. So for me to go & say I enjoyed is rare. My gal friend & I were looking for something inexpensive on the strip & checked it out. She's from the east coast so she's familiar & of course with the Harold & Kumar movies I wanted to try it at least once. We stopped in here. It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered two veggie sliders. I was told that I'd have to wait an extra 10 mins or so because they don't get ordered often so they take a little more time. That was no problem. We also got onion chips, fries, mozzarella sticks, & drinks & normal sliders for her. While we waited we talked to some nice older gentlemen who sat next to us since it was so full they needed a place at our table to have anywhere to eat. They told us about how back in the day when they were young they went to White Castle after getting stoned & also told us about the old uniforms. They were really funny & nice so that was a fun quirk of being there. I enjoyed the veggie sliders. They had edamame in them which I eat regularly so that was a nice treat. I'm not a huge fan of black bean burgers so edamame was a nice alternative! I loved having a veggie option available so I give lot's of props to White Castle for doing that when many other places will not consider people who do not eat (don't eat a lot) of meat. The onion chips & fries were very American style & since I don't eat those types of foods often they tasted good for the rare occasion. If I ever needed a quick, inexpensive bite with a vegetarian option I would stop by here again.\n",
      "I was elated that White Castle finally came to the Las Vegas Strip! Being a former East Coaster and New Englander, my family often visited family in New York City. We always made it a point to go to White Castle. Love the burgers! Had the opportunity to introduce White Castle to my wife and my son this summer! I remember getting them for .10 cents a burger. lol. I will admit that it is a little pricey but then again, you are paying to be on The Strip. I wanted to add an additional side note on the service. Of the 3 times I have visited White Castle here on the strip, I have had the fortunate pleasure of having Nohemi take my order at the counter. She is an absolute doll! I give her 2 thumbs up for her welcoming smile, attentiveness, and overall hospitality. Great job Nohemi and keep up the great work! My family and I will DEFINATELY be back!\n",
      "Was told I was going there because because of the tourist attraction, not the food. They were right. The food is just ok and kinda pricy. Can get just as good of a White Castle burger at the grocery store in the frozen section. It'd be cheaper too.\n",
      "Way overrated! Only famous from Harold and Kumar. The food isn't that great and it is pricy. I would never recommend white castle but if you understand you aren't here for great food and willing to pay the premium, then by all means take the shot!\n",
      "It's legendary so I had to try it. First impression: not bad. It's a tiny burger for $1.29. You can buy them as part of a combo or get a pack....like a 100. I kid you not. It is on the menu. Personally, I'd opt for a combo with 4 of these mini burgers plus a side and a drink. You have to eat it hot otherwise it does not taste good. The bread is soft like those Hawaiian rolls. It is not bad but honestly, I don't get what all the fuss is about. There is always a line but it moves fast. Worth trying.\n",
      "I walked by and saw there was no line and I had time to kill so I went in to try this hype. There's a part of me that was curious as I grew up in California where we don't have these. Ordering was pretty efficient and I got my order in a matter of minutes. I've only ever had the microwaved ones to go by and there are pretty much the same slider with cheese in taste minus 2 things - these had pickles in it and the bread is softer since it wasn't frozen. I don't know if that is a positive feat that a microwaved product taste the same so you can have these anywhere or that it's pretty bad that I can see something cook up fresh on a grill and have it be no better than what I can reheat at home. Fries were pretty standard crinkle fries. Maybe nostalgia is way more powerful and brainwashy in other people but I didn't really get this one. I already don't really get the crazy fandom of other fast foods, but I think some of those are justified after this. In N Out, Five Guys are actually pretty good fast and fresh options so I understand how that can be satisfying. Cheap lowest denominator type of fast food - the type for being fat fucks, drunken and stoned. That is the only time I've ever gotten any sort of satisfaction from White Castle is a late night binge with friends who raided the supermarket frozen aisle, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box for some mad munchies marathoning while being too inebriated on drink, herb and food to move from their chair. Being completely sober, drug free and hungry after a long shift at work, my actual senses and judgement was yelling \"WTF....how is this worth a long line?\" as I took bites from my sliders. I left a bit salty that I wasted my calories on that. These are the type of famous places that is the reason foreign friends think America is gross when they try it, just by going by brand hype. I normally don't write pretentious fuck type reviews, but I definitely agree our American fast food enfatuation is the worst.\n",
      "From the Midwest, and having moved to the southwest, it was great to have White Castles again on Our trip to Vegas....the down side is parking.....where do you park? Luckily we stayed at the Venetian, but during the hot temps of summer we only visited once. I don't know how you'd take a cab here either. If someone knows please let us know. Walking is a problem for us. They tasted just like we remembered. Interesting set up, casino and Denny's all I. The same building.\n",
      "The absolute worst crap Ive had in a while. Eastcoasters say its the best food they had growing up! !! You people are crazy. This can't be life. Avoid. You have been warned. If you didn't grow up on this, don't die on it. Eat some real food.\n",
      "I had no idea this was a real thing. I watched Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle and I really thought this place was make believe... UNTIL one day my friends and I were walking down the strip and my best friend suggests we go to White Castle since we were walking towards it. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES, I probably felt the same as Harold & Kumar when they finally reached their destination! The food is DELICIOUS. I've never tried anything like this before. And ever since then, every Vegas trip has to consist of a quick stop to White Castle. Too bad we don't have White Castle in LA, this could have been my go to!! My friends and I were waiting in line outside (as shown in my picture), but I coudn't take any pictures of the savory burgers and fries because my friends and I devoured them! I love how each burger comes in its own box, or else they'll all just get squished together. It's such a simple burger, yet it tastes so flavorful. I've been taking trips to Vegas with my parents and brother since I was born, so I'm not sure why they've never introduced me to this!!\n",
      "First, if you come here for an earth shattering meal to a place known for feeding small burgers that is the basis of a stoner movie, you really need to get a CAT scan and a reality check. However, if you come here to try a typically East Coast only chain that serves small greasy little burgers that spawned a Stoner movie, then you won't be disappointed. This place is inside a casino but has about 10 tables, is stylized like the East coast locations, and has an assembly crew to handle the giant lines. Expect about a 20-30 minute wait when you go to order. I love these little burgers, they are the size of a post-it note and about 2 inches tall. Each one is served in a small cardboard box. I like the original without cheese (its just a greasy bun, onions, and patty), the wife likes the ones with cheese. We pick up 15-20 when we are in the mood for them and these hit the spot from this location. These will not stack up against \"premium burger\" joints, they are not a premium burger. This is your 2 am burger where you got a hangover and you need grease. This is what you get, greasy, greasy goodness. If you want great beef flavor, go to one of the million other burger joints on the strip. If you order any of the sides beware, they are all mediocre. Imagine going to a Burger King and ordering fried chicken... Are you really surprised that it sucks? If you go to White Castle, just get the burgers, skip the rest. If you get the rest, that is on you... The price is a little more than the locations on the East Coast but when everyone else is price gauging on the strip, you can't blame White Castle for doing the same... Worth a try if you have never had it, but do yourself a favor, drink a yard long margarita with a few extra shots first. That will put you in the right state of mind for White Castle.\n",
      "What can I say good old whit castle I'm giving this restaurant a 3 star only because I have mix feelings I love the burgers but hate the after math smoke one should find out why we end up with the results of being on the toilet right after eating the burgers and oh man the (passing of gas is serious) back to the after results when you enjoy eating few of the burgers. The gas feeling is not fun. I was told its 100% beef but cheap beef not A grade beef that's why we can get burgers for 70cents due to it be cheap meat but hey that's just rumors. Anyway back to what I was saying right after I pass over the health conditions eating the burgers I just can't give up the fact that I wanna come back and buy mores. Great work White Castle but fix the toilet issues yours truly Nigel Angus Executive Producer Palm Tree Flow Records LLC\n",
      "Questions: Did I eat at the same place that all the other reviewers did? How much did they get paid or how much did they smoke? Also, what was Harold thinking? Before I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic. Cliff notes Summary: 1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand 2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go. 3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients. 4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal. 5. Sad face. Warning Rant ahead... The HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here. Where is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller. The ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances. In California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better options. It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place. The location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice. In conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement. White Castle is for people that enjoy McDonald's but want a smaller snack with food that taste like it came from the frozen section of a grocery store.\n",
      "Ummmmmmm, I don't know. Way too hyped IMO. When you have In N Out or Shake Shack as other options, why would you come here? The sandwiches taste EXACTLY like their frozen ones.. Which makes me wonder.. I guess people enjoy it as drunchies but even as a drunk I didn't like it. I guess the only thing that I thought was alright were the onion rings. Btw, the next day I was on the toilet for most of the day. Yup. Definitely not a fan.\n",
      "Same great, crappy sliders I grew up loving back in the Midwest. Reminds me of home. The only problem was, I wasn't as drunk as I usually am before making a Whitey's run.\n",
      "I've been obsessed with this place since the movie, Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. That movie came out a while back so I pretty much had forgotten about it. I was at the Mirage watching the volcano erupt at 8pm. I turned around and there it was, the bright sign was shining in my face. It was calling out to me, I had to go. They have no White Castle in Hawaii where I'm from. We had just eaten at a buffet but I had to try this place out. I just got a cheese slider. My hubby got the chicken ring slider combo, which came with fries and a drink. I know that their sliders are small, but it must have shrunk some more because it was tiny. The hamburger patty was paper thin but it was tasty. They serve crinkle cut fries and not shoestring. At least the fries were crispy and not soggy. The wait time for our three sliders and fries was 20 minutes. I guess this must be a popular place on the mainland.\n",
      "We have been eating Whitecastle hamburgers all of our lives this the closest one to our home in Boise Idaho unfortunately it's in Las Vegas on the strip. Be aware there white castles\n",
      "I came in with really high expectations of this place. Since the movie Harold and Kumar came out I've been looking forward to trying this place. I've lived in the west coast my whole life. 1st disappointment was the line out the door(1hr wait). So I decided to come back a few days later. I still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. The sliders weren't bad but they weren't amazing either. The fries and onion rings were pretty good in my opinion. I hate the location because it's a pretty far walk from the parking garage.\n",
      "It's even more amazing than I expected!! The buns are sooooo soft! My whole like I thought the frozen ones were pretty good. This was unexpected and amazing! We were just walking down the strip and ran into a White Castle! I thought I was dreaming!! Sooooooo good!!!\n",
      "Been too long, hated warming up the frozen ones from the market. Finally we get it fresh. Location sucks of course do to parking but worth it..\n",
      "We got the #2 Cheese Slider combo, with 4 cheese sliders, fries, and a drink, and an order of the chicken rings. The employees are very friendly and the food comes out very fast. It is located next to Walgreens on the strip and the restaurant itself is a bit dirty and ghetto but you shouldn't expect that much at a fast food joint. This was my very first time having white castle (never had the frozen ones before either). I must say I am happy I waited to try it here than settle for just trying the frozen versions. I like being special like that haha\n",
      "This is a big case of, \"You always want more what you can't have\" This always hold true to us West Coast folks. Especially after Harold & Kumar took a wonderful journey just to go to one of these White Castles. Let's get down and dirty. In & Out still reigns supreme for fast food burger joints. It beats this by miles! It also beats the East Coast's Shake Shack if you look at it as a whole in terms of value/quality etc. Where Shake Shack actually serves up good quality food, despite a higher price than In & Out (In & Out serves good quality food at a great price--thus why it's hard to beat), White Castle on the other hand tastes as good as it looks--and go look at the pictures. The burgers are tiny, and thus why they serve them in multiples when you order a combo. Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG \"MEHHHH\". Nothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at. This location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right. So if you were hoping to not be exposed to smoke, think again. The staff all seemed great though, despite being hectic opening week. I'm just glad I got it out of the way and was able to say I've tried it.\n",
      "A-OK. Hubby is from the Midwest so White Castle hold a certain nostalgia for him. He waited in line at Foodie Fest and always makes a stop when he goes back home to Chicago. So when Vegas got a WC we had to check it out. Got sliders, fries and chicken rings. Line wasn't to bad, it was a evening midweek. I thought everything was OK. Nothing special but not gross by any means. Sliders tasted the same as the frozen ones to me. I wish they had the full menu but maybe that will come in time.\n",
      "Save your money and buy the frozen ones. It tastes exactly the same. DISGUSTING! Go to McDs down the block. That's waaaaay better. I'm so disappointed. Don't know why Harold and Kumar went so far for it.\n",
      "The only reason I went was because of all the hype I hear about this place, and I think that is why this place was somewhat of a let down for me. I'd say try out simply to say you had White Castle. For $10 you do get full and their onion chips are pretty good, but other than that know that they are mini sliders (and sliders are already small). I guess 4 mini sliders equals an average size burger. I would suggest though when in a group of four get the 10 sliders special and split should get you through and save money when looking to be resourceful with your expenses in Vegas.\n",
      "food: classics. i only ordered one to try and glad i only ordered one. nothing special. it's small, but thats kind of the deal. it's not that flavorful. the buns are soft, which is good normally. in this case, it provides no texture at all to the burger and it feels mushy. ***2/5 service: for fast food, it is not fast at all. granted i am in vegas and people are everywhere. it's such a waste of resources. every burger comes in a small cardboard container. i'm no environmentalist, but even i think thats wasteful. i like how they have 100 burger bundles. that was amazing in a holy crap kind of way. ***3/5 value: i dont typically do fast food joints, but this is such a well known regional place, i had to do it. plus harold and kumar. i swear that's probably whats keeping the place in business. it's cheap and you do get what you pay for. ***2/5\n",
      "On my last 5 day visit to Las Vegas I ate here all 5 days. We don't have White Castle here in California so we take advantage everytime we visit. I love the cheese sliders and for the first time we were able to try the breakfast menu. Amazing. I wish they served it all day. Great prices and the best fast food.\n",
      "I was extremely excited when I found out White Castle came to vegas. I remember eating those ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store. The burgers at White Castle taste exactly like the ones in the frozen section. I am very disappointed. First of all, every worker here looks miserable. Does anybody know how to smile? Say thank you? Don't you work in customer service? I've worked in food and beverage and customer service for a long time and I know that your job can be stressful or whatever but at least look up at me and look like you care. I feel this place could benefit from the manager monitoring everyone. Anyway, I order original cheese sliders and jalapeño cheese sliders. I am awaiting for my number to be called then loudly and obnoxiously on the intercom I hear mine. I'm pretty excited still. I go up to get my food and then ask for ketchup. The lady goes to grab ketchup and hands it to me without saying anything. Then I ask for ranch. She looks irritated and then goes and grabs me ranch. I also asked for mayo then she finally looked up at me, kind of rolled her eyes, grabs that even more frustrated and hands it over. She never said one word to me. The burgers... were okay. I open the bun and the cheese is not melted. In some of them they were partially melted. But man.. at least throw it in the toaster oven or microwave or something. I hate cold cheese. It doesn't look like I'll be coming back. I can just go to the store, buy the freezer ones and warm those up.\n",
      "I love these little guys and I'm very glad they have a location here in Vegas. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the line is too long and they should come up with a better way to meet customers' needs or open another location in Vegas!\n",
      "Finally after 10+ years of being near a White Castle in Ohio and never getting to go... I made it! I was good and got on Cheese Burger and it was delish! My friend compared it to McDonald's. I like McDonald's and I can definitely taste the difference. I can say if this place was closer to me I would want to try everything! The best time to come here would be during the day, forget about coming here at 2 in the morning, the line was insane!\n",
      "For as busy as White Castle is the cheeseburgers that I received or also known as sliders were not bad they were good they were not great the French fries and the onion wedges were stale will not be going back it's not worth the hassle of the traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard\n",
      "Years and years ago, I remember my cousins and I dined at a White Castle in New Jersey. We ordered an entire Crave Case. We ate the entire case! I can't imagine ever doing that now. This was the first time I had White Castle since then. I was severely disappointed and it's not because I went with the veggie burger this time. Everything was disgusting. It was a poor excuse for what they are calling a \"burger\" and \"fries\". Their onion fries were their saving grace. It was the best thing we ordered, which was at least edible. My girlfriends had the burger and neither of them finished their meals. Our order took forever because I ordered the veggie. Apparently it takes longer to make? Perhaps it's because it isn't ordered as much as the burgers? For the 3 of us, we spent a total of $17 which included a beer. This is definitely a cheap eat, and somewhere you'd go if you were drunk and hungry. There's no other reason why you'd \"crave\" this place ever. Save your money and calories and get a real burger from Shake Shack or In n Out Burger.\n",
      "This place was great. Not only was the customer service excellent but we didn't wait for our food for a long time. First time having these sliders and they were great. Perfect size. I didn't feel overly stuffed. The chocolate dipped cheesecake was very good. Small but perfect to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. Definitely will be going back every time I'm in Vegas!!!\n",
      "SHITTY ASS CUSTOMER SERVICE. They literally have no idea what happened to my order I waited over 20 minutes for it, when the wait is usually like less then 5. All the manager said was a weak ass sorry and told me they must have bumped my order. I understand it's only White Castle but do better man.\n",
      "Oh, how I love White Castles. I haven't been to one in years but I saw the sign in Vegas and had to stop. I'm not sure if it's expensive now or those were Vegas prices, but it was steep for a sack of 10, onion rings, and fries. And, I was shocked that they didn't have Big Red as a soda pop offering. That's how you order...even though I don't drink soda really anymore. Onion chips have changed. I wouldn't order those anymore. And fries aren't as good as I remember, either is the fish sandwich. Awww...nostalgia got the best of me, but wait...the little bitty burgers were still on point.\n",
      "I'm from St. Louis & came in on a late night. Ordered the fish sandwich meal (#6) and added cheese to the fries.l, then substituted the drink for a beer ($2). Tasted just like home.\n",
      "Not that great, but I'm sure they're awesome if you're drunk or high, that's how Harold and Kumar did it.\n",
      "Service was good and fast. The food is the issue here. I grew up eating White Castle burgers. I remember getting them from the frozen food section. The burgers at the Las Vegas location taste worse than the frozen ones I've had before. The bottom bread was super soggy, meat not cooked well enough. Maybe it was the way they are cooked. I noticed they cook the meat patty with the bottom bun on top. Which makes it soggy and soaked up with meat juice. I feel this was a complete waste of money. I did not enjoy it and spent way too much for something I could have gotten at my local grocery store for less than 5 dollars. If you want a good burger in Las Vegas go to Shake Shack or literally anywhere else. Do not spend your money here.\n",
      "we were super excited to try White Castle burgers outside of the ones we buy at the grocery store and microwave. our hopes were high because we do love these and figured the real deal would be way better. but to our surprise, they tasted exactly the same. luckily when we arrived, there wasn't much of a line but as we ate, the lunch crowd arrived and the line looped around the casino. i would have been disappointed if I had to wait that long. I was impressed by the chicken sliders which were made from all white meat chicken. the cheese fries were also very good. all in all, this is the perfect hangover food but I would not consider it \"quality\" food.\n",
      "There was so much hype about this place i just had to try it so i tried the hamburger as well as the cheeseburger it was ok nothing spectacular. The wait was too long and the parking was ridiculous i don't think i would go back again.\n",
      "Super cheap food, not that great. Maybe if you are super drunk. Service was nothing memorable. Place is super dirty. They should definitely try to clean it. This was my first time actually going into a store front for white castle.... taste like if i was just to buy the frozen burgers from safeway =/\n",
      "Been waiting to try this place for a LONG time since they opened some months ago. I like that casino Royale put it in their casino. Smart marketing. I can't say I was disappointed but not blown away either. The burgers were fresh but I didn't feel too much of a difference between those and the frozen ones. They were decent though. Once I got to eating the 3rd and 4th burger my mouth seemed to get dryer. Not sure why that was. Anyhow I would come back but it would be because I'm craving it...more like I'm drunk and it's conveniently in the middle of the strip.\n",
      "Very Busy. Long lines, So many people in line the cooks needed a grill 10x10 to keep up. Burgers were great but not quite as good as the White Castle in St Louis MO. I think the fast pace and long lines of people has staff in to big a rush to make the perfect White Castle burger. If you're on the strip and you have time to wait in line it's worth the wait for a white Castle. And staff did seem really stressed out by the sheer number of people being served. Also price of the burgers are higher there then I've paid elsewhere for a white Castle.\n",
      "I'm more disappointed....why would I thought get fresh sliders from actually White Castle would taste better than grab it from frozen section at grocery store turn out is taste exactly the same!! The only difference is I have to go thru the traffic on the strip instead just drive to von and get one...first time and last time never again.\n",
      "How is this popular? Seriously..was this some sick joke made up by East Coasters? This is by far, the nastiest food I've ever eaten. The burgers are soggy and the fries are straight out of the microwave. Such a letdown.\n",
      "I visited this location last weekend. The store is impeccably clean. The staff was nice and moving quickly. The food? Amazing. Yes I ate a whole \"takehomeasack\" Great city to have a 24 hours a day Slider heaven. \"I'll be back!\"\n",
      "This place isn't too bad, I'm sure you've all seen the movie \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\". Well we were always wondering if that place is really as good as the movie portrayed it to be or was it because they were having the \"munchies\". I was finally able to try this place, turns out I stumbled across it while walking up and down the Las Vegas strip. The place is pretty busy, especially since you have everyone from the strip just drinking and looking for food. Which in all, isn't a bad thing. That means it must be good. What I ordered was two chicken sliders with loaded fries. It's cheap, I only paid $8 and thinking these small sliders were not going to fill my appetite but they sure did. The chicken and buns were fresh, no stale taste. The fries were the amazing part to me, loaded with bacon and ranch. I just couldn't get enough of it. Give it a try next time you are wandering around Las Vegas trip, it's quick, cheap and will get you fed so you can continue your Las Vegas adventures!\n",
      "My husband and I were leaving Las Vegas and he just HAD to try out White Castle. We ordered 6 sliders and because of the hype, my expectations was pretty high. To my disappointment, the sliders were not very good. The onions gave me heartburn all day and I could only force one burger down. My husband who eats anything and everything ate 2 and could not eat any more. Tried it once and that'll be about it for me.\n",
      "Chicken sliders were horrible...got back too the hotel and the order was wrong...not worth it.\n",
      "Was surprised to be walking down the Vegas Strip and happen upon a White Castle!. The exterior and interior design of the building is very well done - nice stone work on the exterior and great use of wall graphics inside. Surprisingly, the floor plan works very well, especially considering the long narrow nature of the space they had to work with. Having security was a good idea - it helped keep traffic flowing. As for the hamburgers themselves, they were very well cooked. We enjoyed double cheese, regular White Castles and cheeseburgers as well as fries. And you always have to top it off with a Coca Cola. The burgers were cooked very well - in fact they were some of the best I've had in a long time. Some people think they are greasy but it is actually the steam cooking process that results in a nice soft and somewhat juicy bottom bun. Everything was very fresh and hot off the grill. We also enjoyed their krinkle fries. These were good as well, though I am more a fan of sweet potato fries. With White Castle, you either love them or hate them. I suppose I love them - and the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Customer service was very good as well. I had the opportunity to have brief conversations with several of the staff and they all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their new workplace. They had cleaning staff making sure the front room was clean as a whistle and that recently vacated seats were ready for new customers. It was also good to see they incorporated the Vegas theme in the signage, including a slot machine menu sign. All in all our visits to the new White Castle in Las Vegas were very enjoyable. The quality of food and service was great. We highly recommend it to all relocated East Coast Nevadans.\n"

      "I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for this place yet. So people living in the west coast knows we don't have this we have in n out. Omgosh I won't choose sides I love them both. They're different! White Castle is delicious mini bite sliders. The first time I went I was dumb I got 3 regret it so much and was too lazy to walk the strip from my hotel to get it lol. The last time I went 6 with fries and a milkshake. So good. Do it!\n",
      "We decided to try this place since it was a short walk from our hotel. Located next to Harrah's casino, this place has several guards to ensure nobody cuts in line. Depending on the time of day, you might encounter a line of people waiting outside. We came here at 6 pm on a Monday evening - a short line of 5 people formed outside; when we left 45 min later, the line was around 20 people outside. Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience. As of 2/2/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings. We tried the original sliders, chicken ring sliders, fries, and onion chips (like onion rings but chopped up). Everything tasted like a 2/5 except for the onion chips which tasted better.\n",
      "\"I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west\" - Beastie Boys, \"The New Style\" A classic line from one of the all-time greats, but with two major flaws: 1. Fatburger sucks 2. There's now a White Castle WAY OUT WEST This fairly new White Castle is located in the Casino Royale ... which is appropriate when you realize that the \"Casino Royale\" is a somewhat divey casino with a Best Western Plus serving as the casino hotel. (Hey, at least it's not Ellis Island, right?) It's been roughly 15 years since I was actually inside a White Castle, but the company remains the same ... Jersey-boy turned LV local and Yelper Jay F. was at my side just as he was 15 years back. (This guy used to smuggle White Castle burgers back to LV with him when he visited his parents in NJ. You can only guess his level of happiness) White Castle is one of those fast food places that invokes a strong reaction from people ... and unlike, say, In-N-Out, the reactions can run hot or cold. Those who love it speak of White Castle as a holy grail of fast food, and worship the Crave Case deity. Those who don't get how a thin patty, dehydrated onions, and cheese steamed into one gooey concoction that \"slides\" down your throat (hence the name sliders) can be heaven on earth will be utterly confused about what the big deal is. I had forgotten how sinfully delicious a sack of 10 White Castle sliders are, how gloriously gluttonously disgusting you feel after pounding so many sliders, and the distinctive aftermath that soon follows. Ahhhhh memories ... memories that will last forever.\n",
      "This place wasn't as impressive as I thought it was going to be..maybe it was all of those years of watching Harold & Kumar. Either way, I think my burgers could have been cooked a bit longer. Be prepared to wait longer for your food at night since this place is open 24 hours and caters to the drunks on the strip!\n",
      "I love White Castle should I say I did. This White Castle has the absolute laziest workers I have ever seen. The food was not hot and the place was dirty. I asked the manager Tammy what was going on here. She had no idea! To the Ingram family if you would like an update let me know.\n",
      "I think if I lived in the East Coast I would go to White Castle because it tastes good, but for now I could settle for eating the frozen ones from the store because they taste EXACTLY THE SAME. Do not come here, it's a waste of time. The line wraps against the wall and the entire dining set up is one long table top in the middle and then a bunch of small tables on the sides in a really small space. There's a casino right next to you also, but the entire location is pretty run down because it's one of the older areas of the strip that's still left. When we finally got to the front after like 20 minutes we ordered the Crave Case which comes with 30 sliders, which is cool if you have a bunch of people with you. The cashier asked if we wanted cheese and we decided to only do half with cheese. Turns out it's an extra $5 just to do half with cheese! He didn't even warn us it was going to be more, but I guess we should have assumed it. There's honestly nothing too special about the actual slider. All I can say is that it tastes pretty damn good. All in all, I love White Castle but this location sucks. I guess it's cool if you want the sliders fresh, but it doesn't make that much of a difference. Like I said, head over to your local grocery store and buy the frozen ones instead.\n",
      "This place is whateves to me because it basically tastes like the ones you buy frozen. My boyfriend was eager to come here so we did and he likes it. The reason for my three star is that it's not that bad and I think you should come here at least once for the experience. You have probably been to many fast food-chain like McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack in the box... right? So why not add this to your list? Yes it's a little overpriced but it's on the strip and rent is high but if this place was elsewhere it will be a lot cheaper. However Just enjoy it I'm sure you can try to win ten bucks at a table and try White Castle for free... Hahaha\n",
      "This place is horrible. The. Quality of the food is crap. Might as well go buy the frozen ones and microwave them yourself cuz that's what they taste like. It was a very disgusting meal. Don't believe the hype around this place .\n",
      "\"Don't believe the hype!\" LOL If you're looking for a fast drunk fix then by all means enjoy these bad boys.. Pros: Super soft bread and full of cheese. Cons: meat was similar to Mc Donalds just overwhelming with dehydrated onion flavor. I also ordered the fried onion peels which were a tad old and the breading was too crispy.. not my fav. Overall I suggest spending the 10 bux and give them a try, You might like them! As for me.. FATBURGER for life! LOL\n",
      "Total let down. If you like microwaved burgers with the grease soaked into the bread come here. Barely edible, I scraped a few of my sliders, that bad. On bright side, the onion chips and the beer were good.\n",
      "Great place for the famous original hamburger sliders. The grilled onions at to die for. The bus were soft and tasty. French fries perfectly cooked and crispy. One place to come back when you come to Las Vegas. The place was packed. Open 24/7. Heat place for a good quick meal.\n",
      "A solid location depending upon what you order. Food was cheap and quick. Order the crinkle cut cheese fries. Chicken breast sliders with jalapeño cheese. (The juiciest chicken slider ever) The normal beef sliders are a bit better then the frozen ones. If you love grilled onions and fresh pickle, you will love these. In all seriousness- do not order the chicken ring slider... ORDER THE CHICKEN BREAST SLIDER!!!\n",
      "Don't expect anything that will make a 14 Michelin Star chef rave, you're getting cheap, greasy fast food at a premium because of the location. This is the only White Castle this side of the Mississippi river and it's on The Strip. I loved eating at White Castle whenever I'm traveling and it's nice to get real, unfrozen sliders in my own town. I'm docking it one star because it's pricey for White Castle and the menu is *very* limited.\n",
      "I love White Castle!! But this location is too crowded and too hard to get to. Please build a few stand-alone locations for us locals!!! I parked at the Venetian and walked over to White Castle (it's in front of the Casino Royale) and I wouldn't recommend it...there's a small alleyway with a sign that says \"Casino Royale Best Western Entrace\" inbetween the Casino Royale and the Venetian and I will try that if I ever go back. The wait was not too bad. There were like 3 sloppy security guards inside...dirty, uniforms didn't fit, bad weaves, etc. They shorted me 1 slider. All 4 people who ate them got diarrhea. TMI?\n",
      "SERIOUSLY?? I see these dumb reviews on here and it blows my mind. People act as if they are dining at a 5 star restaraunt. Complaining about noise, wait, and anything else. White Castle is a fast food chain located INSIDE a casino. Clear on that? Ok, on to the food.... Amazing! These little sliders taste different than any burger you have ever had. From the first bite they absolutely melt in your mouth. Although primarily on the East coast I'm glad to see one come out here to the West coast. The line is pretty long here but that's to be expected. It's a new restaraunt in town and the taste is amazing! I will be visiting here every time I'm in Vegas! It's a great grab-no-go spot while roaming the town of Vegas!!\n",
      "Eek! Methinks not is RIGHT. I wanted to come here to see what all the hype was about. Sorry East Coast, White Castle did nothing to me. It did not wow me. It did not make me go crazy. I just felt like poop afterwards. It was so expensive (maybe because it's located directly in the middle of the strip), for what it really is. A little slider.... with a weird piece of looking meat. And you can tell they're already made just sitting there, waiting for someone to pack it once you order it. It wasn't great nor was it horrible, it was just blah. And no one told me but they put ONE pickle in it. I know it's a classic, but it ain't for me. Sorry fans. I'd rather spend my money at In-n-Out.\n",
      "Finally, eating at a White Castle!! It everything I hoped it would be and locals get 10% off too. Can't wait to comeback again. Only wish was that they had another location off the strip.\n",
      "extremely expensive for some bite size sliders but so satisfying! i don't leave there with anything less than 20 sliders. it's a great thing to have leftovers you can bring back to the room.\n",
      "This place is for sure a 5 Star experience so you all need to get down to the Strip to try this place out for sure. The Ambiance - While you are waiting in line, you will get to speak to so many people from the Mid or East Coast where they all grew up having White Castle Sliders. I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation. It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!! The Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes. When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside. The Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall. However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2\"x2\", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many. This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right. The Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually. The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable. We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together. There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers. The Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc. Buy why? - I wonder why put this small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local. I will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts. In the context of the whole experience, very good place to go. GK says, check it out.\n",
      "OK. I've been waiting to find a white castle somewhere near San diego. I come to vegas for a conference and walking along the strip I see white castle!!! OMG. I was so excited I texted my wife (who stayed home with the kids :-( ). I'm a burger guy, and having tasted this, I'm really disappointed in the taste. There is hardly any meat and mostly carbs. The mean is like deli sliced beef. The service is fast and the price is pretty affordable. But you get what you pay for. Micky D all they way still.\n",
      "Not as great as how Harold and Kumar made it look. Line was long and after getting the food (It was packaged very nicely) and tasting it for the first time I probably would not go out of my way for White Castle. Food wise I was disappointed, but what was even more disappointing were the workers. They're rude and have extremely bad attitude. If you don't want to give us some extra ketchup why not just leave it out for people to grab then...geez\n",
      "Omg these sliders are crap. Being from the East coast Northern va area I have never tried these so when they came here everyone said it was a must try. Disgusting! I took one bit and that was it. I don't know why everyone raved about this place.\n",
      "After trying this place for the first time, I was not impressed. The burgers were not that tasty and the fries were limp and not crunchy. They handled the crowd decently enough and had plenty of employees on hand. I wish my experience was better. I won't return. I'm not sure what people back east see in this place, cause I sure don't see it. Other than my experience, if you like the food then they did just fine on all other points.\n",

      "Okay, let's get this out of the way right up front. White Castle is an ACQUIRED TASTE. People who have grown up on In-N-Out or Fatburger or (insert burger chain here) probably aren't going to appreciate the food here, and that's fine (though, if you try them and love them; PROPS! and welcome to the club). Let me make one point though; it is possible that none of those places would exist if not for this burger chain. White Castle is the OG of fast food, established in 1921, and pioneered many of the technologies still in use today throughout the industry. This is the first , and only White Castle in The West. Like all White Castles, it is clean, and service is friendly and fast. It is located inside a casino, so that's different. Now, about the food; here's what to expect; the burgers are small and thin, and there are reasons for that. The truly unique thing about sliders (and please stop calling other places' mini-burgers sliders; they're not sliders, they're just small burgers) is how they are cooked. The meat never touches the flattop. It is laid on top of a bed of onions and cooked with the onion steam. This is why the meat is flattened so thin (and has holes poked in it); a thick patty would never cook with this sort of indirect heat. The bun is also laid on top of the cooking meat so that it gets steamed also. This results in a very soft, some would say soggy, bun. These features make White Castle burgers unique (well, almost unique; the southern Krystal chain makes burgers this way since they copied White Castle's model back in 1932). The burgers are served with the onions they are cooked on and a single pickle slice. As you can imagine, the cooking and serving method results in a burger with a lot of onion flavor. If you don't like grilled onion, this burger is not for you. You can ask for mustard or ketchup, but I don't. They are also available with cheese. I can't comment on their chicken sandwiches and I never will; my childhood didn't include that and when I go to White Castle, I'm reliving a piece of that childhood as much as I'm having a meal. Having said that, take the five-star review with a grain of salt; it might be biased. ;-)\n",
      "Came here for the first time after the club. I was interested in going to this place after I watched itsjudytime's (Youtuber) husband, Benji raved about it when him and Judy came to Vegas. To be honest, it's not worth the hype. People say this place is pretty bomb since it's an East Coast branch but it was all right. The portion is super small so you def have to get some more items if you're hungry. I got the regular sandwich (with buns and sausage link pattie) and loaded fries. The loaded fries tasted much better because it had a nacho cheese sauce with bacon. Other than that, if you're into trying something new. But I would pass! Oh well!\n",
      "I had never been to White Castle before and I was excited to try them for the first time. Seating was awful and so was the food. What was I thinking. I don't even think I could stomach them on a drunk stomach.\n",
      "Really fast and pretty good for the price! 24hrs so if you get hungry from gambling your life away, and you can't afford those fancy buffets, THIS is the perfect midnight snack! Loved it!\n",
      "I'd been looking forward to this place! My neighbor said how good the East Coast WC is. The Las Vegas WC is not so good. So, we ordered, food came quick, and I was really disappointed. It tasted like meatloaf burgers. Maybe I'm just not a fan of tiny sliders. The other issue I have is the amount of trash that is produced. My son just tried the microwave ones and said that they were at lot better that the one we had fresh!\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend it. I was so excited to eat after watching the Harold and Kumar movie. I had been told not to expect much from White Castle from my friends, but even setting a low bar I was dissapointed. I ordered the #2 meal, which is a drink, fries, and 4 cheese sliders for $9.72. First mistake: I didn't realize the sliders come with pickles and onions. It was my fault, although they were not pictured or described on the menu. I was starving, so I brushed the undesired condiments off my sliders. Sadly, I only made it through 3 sliders before my stomach started to hurt. I feel a little sick. so I decided to toss the last slider and call it a night.\n",
      "First time ever at a White Castle. So good at 1am. Not sure how that review would be at 1pm....\n",
      "As a transplant to vegas from the Midwest. This is a A White Castle. Very busy , very busy, oh did I mention that it is very busy. If you're not a fan of crowds, I recommend not going to this location or sending someone In for you. Why did they put the only one on the strip. The strip sucks, I hope that we get one off the strip.\n",
      "These sliders are really good for DRUNK MUNCHIES. Here you have dehydrated onions that are soaked the thrown onto a hot flat top grill. From here they put on the meat patties, which in turn get STEAMED instead of developing a nice brown crust... You're basically eating an entirely steamed slider that is extremely bland. The bread was so soggy that it was falling apart. The meat itself felt like mush and the onions would have been better if they were caramelized. Not a fan of this place at all. OVERALL: I would definitely recommend anyone to try this just to be aware of what is offered, but I just don't see myself coming back unless I'm walking around the strip late at night drunk and have the munchies.\n",
      "The dying question, is it worth all the hype?! Really hard to say but leaning closer to a \"nope.\" I never had the pleasure of trying the \"real thing\" but I do love the frozen ones. Frankly, it was not much of a difference from those, just the bread was \"fluffier.\" Them pickles killed it for me though. :( I also got the an order of onion chips and fries for good measure. Yea...not really impressed and feel I haven't been missing out on much because we have In n Out. Yup, I said it. Deal with it. Luckily the wait was like 10 minutes so hey, at least I can say I tried it.\n",
      "Had to satisfy my curiousity so I tried it. Taste is ok kinda like a mcdonalds cheeseburger without the ketchup. Fries suck. Cashiers are clueless. How this place got so famous I do not know.\n",
      "We were only excited about this place because of Harold and kumar and were extremely let down. The fries were soggy and unflavored. The burgers were also mediocre.\n",
      "Having grown up in NYC and I can remember when the burgers were 8 cents, I remember being so excited when White Castle started selling frozen sliders in Costco and then grocery stores. I personally think the frozen ones are better than the ones I had yesterday from the new location on the strip. At 2AM we still waited at least 15 minutes. All we ordered were regular burgers. You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good. 3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering. Overall, based on the visit, I will not return. Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions. This is a post script: I just came home from Sam's Club where I purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers for about $11 and they are way better than the sliders we got on the strip a few weeks ago.\n",
      "Some of the worst management ever. We had a problem with our food and she acted like she didn't care. Doesn't take business seriously. The manager we dealt with was named Barbra Jean. I won't be returning to this restaurant again.\n",
      "Eh So I have always wanted to try white castle. I guess walking by the White Castle on the strip and having no idea it was here was similar to someone coming out to California excited to try in n out. I can't really explain the feeling of silly excitement to try fast food? It's almost embarrassing to admit. Regardless on an impulse I went in with my friends, and waited in the ridiculously long line with a single cashier to place our order. We were looking for more of a snack and attempting to just try everything. Sliders, chicken rings, fries, and cheesecake stick is what we ordered to snack on. Didn't realize there were pickles on the sliders, which I guess is my fault for not being more cautious, so that first bite made me cringe. However once I removed the green devil slice and got into the slider I was...well still not impressed. It's hard to judge a fast food place like a high class restaurant, but I was still disappointing. The slider was very akin to a McDonalds burger, and the chicken was airated. Fries were crinkle and a little bit cold which was upsetting. If I had one close by I dont see myself ever really going over the other fast food chains which just are better.\n",
      "Now I know why Harold & Kumar went on an adventure for these sliders. Idk if it was me being drunk or plain hungry but these burgers were magical. Soft and chewy, the cheese melts in your mouth. Glad I was able to check this place out when I was in Vegas. Definitely stopping by again in September.\n",
      "Finally checked out a White Castle and sadly...it tasted just like the microwave kind. It was a bit of a long wait, at least 40 people in front of us, and only one cashier. Sliders were about $2 a pop, and there's a good amount of seating. Since we only ordered 2 sliders ours came out quick. It was tasty, but no need to go back.\n",
      "Always a treat and a pleasure to get a little of home all the way out here. Service is always great and it's always clean.\n",
      "Just like they're fresh from the microwave except with a slice of pickle! Very friendly cashiers!\n",
      "If you're going to get the CRAVE CASE make sure change it to cheese slider not the pickled one cuz after 2 slider you're going to get tired eating it.\n",
      "My boyfriend brought my family and I to this restaurant. I like the idea that the chef cooks in front of you and our chef was hilarious, which made the environment more welcoming. However, the food was still too simple for me. The shrimp was marinated pretty well and they give large amounts so many of you will surely feel full.\n",
      "J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Kobé. Nous y sommes allés pour le 60e de ma mère et c'est un endroit parfait pour un anniversaire. La nourriture est excellente, tant le porc, les crevettes, mais surtout le filet mignon! Les chefs sont plein d'humour et savent faire un show impressionnant. Pour les fêtés, 3 serveurs viennent à votre table et chantent \"Bonne Fête\" accompagnés d'un gong. Bref, du plaisir pour les yeux et les papilles!\n",
      "Tried out this restaurant because we had a Groupon and seems like everyone else did too. Located above a cheap hotel, this restaurant is more spacious than it looks, with several grilling tables that can seat about 8 or so people at once. We had a reservation for 7 and had to wait for another family to arrive before the chef could prepare all our food since it is cooked at the same time. Even after they arrived, it was a long wait. Avoid this place at all costs if you have allergies since everything is cooked on the same grill with the same utensils. The concept is simple, you pick your choice of meats, either one, two or three choices which will be served with soup, salad, vegetables, rice and noodles plus ice cream for dessert. Oddly the noodles were spaghetti pasta mixed with bean sprouts, cooked in a teriyaki or soy sauce and sesame type seasoning. Their sauce makes everything you order taste more or less the same, its sweet and easy to please but I have no clue if any of the food was representative of true Japanese teppanyaki. The chef used a lot of butter to make up for flavor. As for the show experience, our chef started off with good enthusiasm and tried his best to crack jokes but everyone could tell it was the same lines he uses with everyone and it ended up feeling dated and tired. There was no fancy knife works, flip of utensils, or special food presentation such as the stacking of onion rings into a little volcano or cracking of eggs into the rice. Basically most things I expected from watching videos and TV were lacking. There was this moment where he did set the shrimp on fire when spraying it with oil and that was the most entertaining bit. It raised the rooms temperature by a lot, beware, this restaurant gets really hot especially with the low ceilings, and constant burning of the gas grills, all I smelt were fumes and ended up getting dizzy. After almost 3 hours we finally left and felt disappointed that it ended up being more expensive than we thought. Even with the coupon we purchased, we felt it wasn't quite worth for the quality of food or entertainment. Other than the protein, things like rice and beans sprouts really cost pennies and that's what I got full from. If you're really curious and looking for something out of the ordinary, I still recommend the experience but I wasn't wowed.\n",
      "As a treat for my sister's 40th birthday, I wanted something special and that we never tried. I read some of the bad reviews here (and on tripadvisor), but still chose here because they have free parking and a Sunday to Thursday menu which is about $10 less per person. (it helps a lot when paying for 5 people). I would have preferred Toyo downtown, but it would have cost way too much. We arrived a bit too early when they opened and were the only ones there, the service took a while to get going. Once we got apps and drinks, things improved The tempura and chicken wings were delicious, the spring rolls were good, but only 2 small rolls for $5. Once we finished, we met our cook who was very polite and cordial but not as flashy as some of the cooks I saw on youtube. Yes it's cheesy and tacky and it feels like the 70's inside. Real Japanese people probably don't eat like this, but we had fun, which is what matters. The food was pretty tasty and we were all full when we left. You get soup, salad, the Teppanyaki of your choice with tea and dessert, and a nice little show for about $20. They also gave us a couple of bamboo calendars. The service is pretty good, but they wait for a table to be full before sending a chef, so you might be dining with strangers. but it's the same at other Japanese steakhouses. This place is a bit out of the way, but there is free parking and it's about a block from the Metro Langelier Subway Station.\n",
      "It was good very funny the cook would have been better to serve all the food together and not part by part ! Meaning he cooks the shrimps and gives it cooks chicken gives it cooks rice and gives it ! Man im hungry i wanna eat loool\n",
      "Depuis le temps que je voulais essayer un teppanyaki à Montréal, j'ai du faire un choix entre 2 adresses et celui-ci me semblait plutôt attrayant. Je réserve donc une table pour 4 un samedi soir, mais, quelle surprise en arrivant de devoir attendre plus de 10 mins devant le comptoir avant d'être placés! Pour mon anniversaire, je souhaite commander un bon saké, malheureusement sur les 3 affichés sur la carte, seul, celui que je trouve à la SAQ que je bois \"tous les jours\" disons, est disponible... Ensuite, le resto s'appelle \"Kobe\", je m'attends donc à mettre le paquet et me prendre du bœuf à l'huile de massage (blague à part) mais évidemment il n'y en a pas, néanmoins le filet mignon était succulent... Nous commandons tous (avec les 5 autres convives à la table, le côté traditionnel japonais des tables chauffantes), bref, nous attendons tous plus de 20 mins que le chef arrive pour nous faire son show. Et c'est parti! Beaucoup d'humour, ambiance bon enfant, le sourire, feu sur la plaque, tout le monde est servi, merci bonsoir, au suivant. J'aime: - L'attention aux allergies pour ceux qui le sont aux crevettes etc... - Le show, mais j'ai connu des cuistos japonais qui jonglaient avec leurs couteaux, c'était pas mal plus impressionnant! J'aime pas: - Le côté usine, clients à la chaîne, d'immenses salles et des chefs surbookés. - Les toilettes bouchées!!! Les 2 toilettes des filles non fonctionnels, c'est honteux! - La carte (vins et mets) beaucoup trop simple et restreinte. - Le gras, on aime le beurre, faut pas que ça colle, mais y'a des limites! - Le prix, trop cher pour ce que c'est. Grosse déception :(\n",
      "Rude staff and super dirty place... go to beni Hana down the street\n",
      "Good spot for a quick fix of fried chicken, perfectly cooked, not greasy or overly salty.\n",
      "Been there twice. Second time because I didn't have a choice. Even though the Basak specializes in Korean fried chicken, it is the worse Korean fried chicken I've ever had. I'd rather spend the same amount of money for twice as much and better chicken at KFC, or get much better fried chicken at Chez Bong or Les Saisons de Corée two streets down. Their portions and the juiciness of the chicken was way below expectation. The flavour wasn't as bad, but doesn't compensate for the rest. The only reason why I'm giving a 3 stars is because of the atmosphere and the service. The place is very clean and a few screens are playing kpop videos. With so many other choices of Korean restaurants around, I would avoid it as much as I can.\n",
      "Résumé : 17$ pour 10 ailes de poulets à l'ail et soya pour emporter, soit 1,70$ par aile. Les ailes sont bonnes, avec un bon ratio poulet/friture. J'ai aimé le daikon mariné qui venait avec pour diluer le goût trop sucré et salé de la sauce. Trop cher pour ce que c'est. Service: Considérant que des commentaires indiquaient que le service était lent, j'ai commandé d'avance pour emporter. La serveuse ne comprenait pas le français et m'a demandé de commander en anglais. Ce qui n'est pas étonnant pour le quartier, mais quand même décevant. Nourriture: J'ai aimé les ailes de poulet. Un peu trop sucré, ce qui peut tomber sur le cœur à la longue, mais le daikon (radis) mariné permet de changer le goût entre deux bouchées. Le poulet était bien croustillant et goûtait bon, mais ne vaut pas le prix demandé. Prix: À ce prix, on peut se permettre de bien meilleur repas dans le coin. Ambiance: Il y a des places assises, mais c'est un petit restaurant. Ambiance pour jeunes universitaires ou famille plutôt que pour un souper romantique. Il y a une tv avec musique coréenne.\n",
      "this is a cool place! It's a nice Korean style fried chicken spot that serves some pretty damn near perfect fried chicken morsels that make you fall in love with chicken all over again. Their honey mustard is pretty awesome as well Something interesting is that there's a bell at the table that calls the server over to you, which felt weird doing. It's a good place to go to when you want a quick bite and do not want to spend tons of cash\n",
      "It was great I had cheessy bread and large spicy chicken for 33$ The chicken was well seasonned but I expected more cheesy bread for 4.99 but the cheesy bread was crispy and tasted really good !\n",
      "I want to be be impartial and totally unbiased, but if a place makes plain fried chicken wings and they are delicious enough to eat on their own, they are first rate in my book. However, if you love sticky, sweet, and salty chicken, then their soy garlic wings (and pieces) may just become addictive. All I need is some soy garlic wings, rice, and the included daikon cubes, and I'm a happy lady! I've had the kimari, which are nice, but are kind of one note. I have been meaning to try the cheese corn because those are two of my other favorite things, I can't imagine it would be bad. A few things to note: it's not as fast as fast food (which is good because it's fresh) and it's at a higher price point (I think it's worth it but YMMV).\n",
      "I was very into this store, I even ordered 250 $ of fried chicken here for my birthday party. But today my friends go there and ordered sweet and sour chicken, the owner made spicy fried chicken, so they ask for a change. The owner just refuse they made a mistake and keep saying this is what they ordered. I understand that they don't want to waste money to make another dish, but the service attitude is really disappointing. Will not go there anymore. Plus, the portion is pretty small, and taste not that good. I suggest Mon Ami and Dawa, they might be a little far, but the portion is much bigger.\n",
      "The best. It's cute and modern and the staff is friendly and quick and their food is soooooo good\n",
      "This place is not really far from where I live so I thought.. Let's give it a shot! Meh... I expected more from the reviews :-/ You get very small portions for the price ($28 for an Half n' Half, with nothing else than the fried chicken itself and a little side of white pickled radish...). The original fried chicken was too dry, but the spicy marinated fried chicken was excellent. Juicy and savoury, very spicy :) The service was excellent though, even for a take out. The place is nice, simple and clean. But don't go for the quantity... Also, I liked that they ask if you want the bones or not. Hopefully you'll like it when u go!\n",
      "The service was really bad and disrespectful. Forcing the customers to order as per the need of their business was not an appreciable attitude.\n",
      "The buldak chicken is AMAZING if you like spicy food. I also had the half and half boneless chicken (hot and garlic) and an order of sweet and sour chicken among some other odds and ends and everything was very good. the soju is definitely worth a try but its a bit strong to drink with dinner in my opinion. they have kpop videos playing on the TVs which is cool. the only thing I wish they had were some Korean beers and sodas. they do have a small handful of Korean drinks but nothing that is really refreshing enough to have with dinner. that is just my opinion though. the food seems very authentic to me although I have never been to korea, however all three times I have eaten here approximately half of the customers were Korean so I suppose that must mean something considering the amount of other Korean spots in the area that don't seem to have an abundance of Korean customers like this place does.\n",
      "My God! What a trip! With Korean Pop videos playing on all flat screens, see-through plastic chairs and Korean Fried Chicken, what else do you need? I can see the pre-hockey game crowd coming here for beer and chicken wings but I think to just limit yourself and not trying out the different varieties of fried chicken (soy garlic, spicy), the tempura veggies then you might be missing out. I think the craziest part is watching the Korean pop videos. That's a cultural experience in itself.\n",
      "The spicy wings there's are amazing best I've had in a long time. Great service and there establishment is very clean and pleasing to enter.\n",
      "Very mediocre fried chicken but terrible service. I ordered the food for delivery and it took an hour and twenty minutes. Chicken was no longer crunchy and fresh by then. Owner had the audacity to call me and tell me to tip before I even received my food.\n",
      "Great chicken, terrible service. Waited more than an hour for delivery, had to call back many times to confirm if the deliveryman was on the way. When he arrived, very unprofessional. Did not know how much change to give, and was pulling it out of a wallet as if he was fumbling to give change to a homeless person. He even had the nerve to brashly ask me, 'So how much tip will you give me?' I gave him a tip so that I didn't have to deal with him anymore. Food was colder than the service.\n",
      "This place was so amazing that I actually was inclined to write a review on yelp. I took my girfriend there for dinner after seeing some pictures from Instagram of Basak and to get to the point: we loved everything about it. We ordered the half and half with classic and spicy chicken. The spicy chicken was super flavourful and the classic was lightly salted. They were just fried so the skin was just the right amount of crispy and the chicken was super tender. We had some beer and rice to accompany the meal and it was an absolute delight. Definitely the best friend chicken I have ever tried so far in Montreal (sorry Poulet Bronze).\n",
      "If you like fried chicken, you'll like this place. Delicious, crispy Korean fried chicken that came out nice and hot and juicy, not dry at all. My family and I shared the special that includes a pitcher and 2 types of chicken - Original and Spicy. This feeds two people so we also ordered the medium size Soy Garlic boneless chicken. Would recommend ordering a large size or another medium order for a group of 4. Glad we stumbled upon this restaurant during our Montreal visit!\n",
      "Thought this place was legit 4.5/5 until a friend (whose palate is sorta missing) told me it's great. So I became wary and decided to order less. Well, looking back, thank f*ck for that. I don't go about spending 20$+ at KFC, so why would I do so here? Turns out, the speciality fried chicken is probably just a less oily version of pop corn chicken from Popeye's, or some sort of general tao chicken. But if you don't pay 14$ for half a plate of general tao chicken (24$ for a full plate), why do so here -- and, what's korean about it? We had the garlic and soya boneless fried chicken (tastes just like tao chicken), because the 2 other 'flavours' are 'classic' and 'spicy' -- very interesting choices hmm. Anyway the other thing that reviewers raved about is the 'buldak', or in english, extra spicy chicken... Extra spicy turned out to be extra disappointing. Basically, it's a stir fry of chicken with onions, carrots, and daikons in a korean sauce (dry rub in water). Annnnd it wasn't barely spicy. Price-wise, it's 20$ for that average sized plate (refer to pictures below)... which is a good 150% the price of what it is worth. Now some of you are saying 'well you haven't tried their chicken wings'. My answer: fk datttt. If the boneless chicken is already kinda dry, I don't want to think about how tough the wings are going to be when the heat finally cooks through the bones. What I liked about this place though, is that bell you can ring for service, and they give 10% off for people with the MCSS card. It was pretty spacious and K-pop videos are played on two TV screens. The owners were pretty nice, but I figured that they'd better be extra nice, because what they're cashing in for their KFC rip off is quite a stunt (and definitely worth that 4.5/5). But as much as their food goes, it's a 2.5/5: no go.\n",
      "FANTASTIC! If you love chicken, you'll love this place. Perfect Korean style chicken!! & Their fried kimmari was amazing too!! Woo!!!\n",
      "I love korean fried chicken! This place has it down pretty well. My favorite is the bone in chicken with sweet and spicy sauce. Nice place to hang out with a few friends over chicken and beer. They also have TVs that are always plaging korean music videos\n",
      "Toujours contente de trouver un restaurant ouvert tard. Ça c'est top! L'ambiance \"corean pop\" est super cool. Ma petite sélection: choix de salade de mais et laitue, choix de boulettes de poulet pané aux sésames en sauce barcecue épicée + des rouleaux de pâtes et patate douce frits. C'est assez curieux mais j'aime assez !\n",
      "I went there 3 times already. Last time was the best. After a heavy badminton day, I was hungry for Fried chicken. We order half chicken, large chicken wings and sapporo. Chicken is juicy and crispy. I love their chicken wings. delicous. crispy. They gave daikon cube as side dish which was great. What amaze me was the table calling button and great Kpop song on 2 huge screens. Beer and fried chicken feels great. On the other hand, their patbingsu is awful. It's horrible. It felt like some cheap shaved ass topped with red beans and candies. Nothing compare to other patbingsu I had before. They should many focus on chicken and alcohol. Being the only Korean Fried chicken place in downtown Montreal is a strong advantage. The owner is super gentle. Good service. He enjoys his job. That's for sure. Overall good experience. Kpop music, Korean Fried Chicken in Downtown. Good place.\n",
      "The owner is super nice and the fried chicken tastes really clean, simple and not too greasy, also the portions are good too but it is slightly pricey! Still, would go here again :) yum\n",
      "Located downtown next to Concordia, The Basak is a small and cute Korean restaurant. It was interesting seeing that they had an electronic device that you could ring to call the waiter. However I do think that for a small size restaurant like this one, one should be able to communicate directly with the server with the wave of a hand or an eye contact. Food does look good on picture, but it can get dull if you order only chicken. Don't get me wrong, the fried chicken is tasty and well cooked. We tried both the original and the garlic/soya sauce, both were very good, I recommend the combo plate with half of both. Price point is a little bit high for fried chicken, especially because it doesn't come with any sides. You can order either a half chicken or whole, with bones or without. I would suggest ordering a whole chicken and splitting it in 2-3, since the portions aren't that big. This is definitively a heavy meal, and I would've appreciated it if it came with a salad and rice (they probably have a plate like this for lunch, but they should make it available for diner as well). Rice has to be ordered separately, and there weren't much choice for healthy veggies on the menu. Funny thing that happened during my visit was that we were told that they sold out on rice! How does that even happen in an asian restaurant? I was quite surprised since it was around 7pm. TLDR; somehow expensive, cute decor, dry meal, quick fix, slow service, share plates, eat your 8-9 portions of fruits/vegetables at home.\n",
      "Bon restaurant coréen ! Ambiance fast-food. Plat assez épicés à mon goût ! J'avais commandé comme une Kimari Tempura qui était savoureux . Mon plat principal était un poulet braisé épicé !\n",
      "Cool little spot for some Korean fried chicken and drinks. The Basak also has a cool little feature of a table side buzzer/button that allows you to buzz in a waiter to order more food or drinks. Food was good, price is alright, boneless fried chicken was crispy, pickled daikon is always great, and the vegetable tempura that they served was something new to me. Potato, sweet potato, onions, green onions mixed into a patty and tempura fried was pretty good.\n",
      "We ordered the marinated chicken (yang nyum chicken) with chicken and green onions (pa-dak) via phone. The lady I spoke to was very calm and was very sweet sounding. She told us it would take 30 minutes to arrive. Usually it takes about 50 minutes according to my brother so I was hopeful. Nope. I heard a knock about 15 minutes past an hour. Not impressed at all, I handed the guy the money from my wallet, and as I was reaching into my pocket to give him change for the complete 12% tip (btw, the lowest I tip is 10% for the slow/rude people), he looks at me and tells me \"uhh people usually tip 10%.\" ............... So I fished out the rest of the money, and even after I gave him a 12% tip, he left grudgingly. If you're an 45 minutes late from the expected time, and 30 minutes late from the usual time, and you didn't even bother calling us, you can't really expect a good tip... At least in my book. With two cokes, minus the tip, the total was about $62, which is hella expensive. My brother and I finished it and were content, but we definitely could have made three times the amount with $30, marinade and all. Overall, the place is good for cravings, but I certainly don't want to order from here often otherwise my wallet will be lighter and my conscience will be heavier.\n",
      "I tried this place out after discovering it was so close to the hotel I was staying in. My group of three ordered take out - half fried and half spicy marinated chicken to share. First, for the price, I thought the portion size was on the small side. Given that the walk from the restaurant to the hotel was maybe five minutes, I expected the chicken to still be crisp. The fry batter was far from crispy - even for just the fried chicken. The spicy chicken was not spicy at all and the sauce overall tasted more like ketchup than anything else. I was looking forward to having some decent Korean fried chicken but was disappointed.\n",
      "I have always been an avid fried chicken lover, so I knew I had to check this place out! Their interior is pretty simple but nice, with Kpop playing in the background. I went with 2 friends, and we ordered fried chicken (obviously) - and chose the half marinated, half soy garlic boneless option, and also ordered a side of mozzarella sticks. I really enjoyed the soy garlic chicken, and I love how the chicken wasn't overfried. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good as well, but I didn't think that 6 sticks were worth 5 dollars ): They are a bit limited in other food options, but I think they serve the best Korean fried chicken in downtown montreal!\n",
      "I love everything about this place. My friends and I affectionately refer to it as \"le Ballsack\", but don't let that put you off, we're silly and this place really is excellent. From the 60's retro styling to the psychedelic, epilepsy inducing k pop playing on TV, Basak effervesces Koreanness. No detail is spared, you'll notice there's electronic bells on each table, a staple of restaurant dining in South Korea and Japan. The fried chicken is solid. Tasty and not too salty. The spicy fried chicken is mixed with some kinda delicious mochi that's coated with delicious spicy sauce. It's excellent. You must try the cheese corn. It's cheap and delicious, it also goes really well with fried chicken. Verdict: Second best Korean fried chicken in Montreal. Best I've had in the downtown core. Try it.\n",
      "The soy garlic chicken was very good. The original was a bit dry and needed some more seasoning. The food was also somewhat expensive. Overall, it was a very yummy meal.\n",
      "First time trying this place. I got duck fried rice (which I've never had before) and it was pretty good. It was different from the fried rice I'm used to but less greasy so maybe not a bad thing. Teriyaki chicken was good although not the best we've had. Cheese puffs are gross.definitely not a Rangoon or crab puff and waaay too sweet for my taste. It was okay but I'm still looking for something awesome out here in Goodyear and this simply isn't it. It's the best option we have found, but nothing compares to our favorite joint out in Peoria (Big Heng on 75th & Peoria).\n",
      "Really tasty and fair price with good size portions. Loved the Kung Pao Chicken and the Fried rice. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Our favorite Chinese rest. Very cost effective if you order take-out. Portions are good and great flavor. Staff is also great and your order generally comes out in a timely manner. Could use more dishes added to the menu.\n",
      "Just had lunch at this establishment. Very friendly service. I got General Tso chicken. Supposed to be spicy but it was rather bland with no spice. Chicken was over fried as it was tough and dry. Fried rice was good but egg roll was evidently old because it was chewy rather than crisp. Likely won't be back which stinks because they are so close.\n",
      "Love ajk, the food is always awesome. We recently celebrated my mom's birthday here since it's her favorite Chinese place. They had no problem seating 30(: they are friendly and welcoming!\n",
      "Just wasn't what I thought it would be. Maybe it was just a bad day or maybe I selected the wrong entrée but unfortunately I did not like the food at AJK Chinese Cusine . The entrée's just weren't what I thought they would be. The sesame chicken that we ordered was completely bland, the mongolian beef did not seem fresh, and the lo mein and fried rice were greasy and lacked any taste. I honestly think you can get same or better quality food at Panda Express.\n",
      "My favorite Asian spot. The AJK Dinner is just the right size for my family of 3.5. I love the Orange Chicken & Mongolian Beef flavors although their Mongolian Beef is more onion than beef. The Milk Tea with boba is perfect every time!\n",
      "I was pleased to find they offer duck on their menu & the portion of duck fried rice I ordered was plentiful. (Didn't blow my hair back, though) I placed an order to go and was pleased with the item, but there wasn't anything special or terrible about it. I may have to try a dine-in experience just to see if we can give this place more stars.\n",
      "Shitty the shrimp was so freaking thick with the batter from being fried and they don't put the cook the food with its sauce. Sooo gross yuck !!! Worst chow mien, I could've had a better dinner at panda.\n",
      "We were there a couple months ago and had a pretty good experience. The place had only been opened for a few months and we didnt know about it until we got a coupon in the mail. We ordered several dishes including: duck fried rice, mongolian beef, kung pao fish, wonton soup and boba thai tea. The mongolian beef and fried rice were excellent, meanwhile the kung pao fish and wonton soup was a little bit over average. I guess we'd have to go back to try more dishes. Overall, it was pretty good.\n",
      "When your tired of eating at big chain restaurants such as Pf's, Pei Wei's ect.. Give this place a try. This establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste. Our favorite's are egg rolls & egg drop soup with hot tea. We've tried all their main entrées & they are all delightful. At the end you'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing. Highly recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "The service was so sweet and friendly! It started off with the young man taking our order he was very nice. When we were done the older woman even boxed up and bagged my food for me. 5 stars for the service. But the reason I only gave 4 stars is because we ordered the orange chicken lunch combo, the sauce was too runny and didn't taste like orange chicken to me :( I was bummed. The lo mein was bland and the fried rice was dark and greasy. Couldn't eat it. My man ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch combo and he liked it but we both thought they could use more flavor! Good prices though!\n",
      "We have been there several times and love the food! It's always fresh and hot and the service is great! It's also very nice inside.\n",
      "Not the worst or something to go home ranting about (the best) I like their food, but I'm still looking for the home run in Chinese cuisine around my pad. We ordered the sweet and sour pork, and orange chicken with brown rice (a nice option). The portions were more than enough for two and I tore it up the next day at work. No one was in there when I came in, hopefully this place picks up because I hate seeing the small guys loose it in this big dog world. :)\n",
      "Have gone to this restaurant for years. I like the fact that they have Boba teas available.\n",
      "We have been going to this establishment for quite some time and have been satisfied with the food. The portion are not the largest we have seems but the food is good. The place is not always busy so it is nice when you want to be able to have a conversation. I would recommend this restaurant if you are sick of the big chain restaurants. Shop local my friends and support the mom and pop places!\n",
      "Great service. Very polite. Clean restaurant. Great tasting food. Reasonably priced. Great variety.\n",
      "I love this place, as far as Chinese to go choices, or when I am in the neighborhood this is my spot. I love how amazing usually taste. I usually get the sesame chicken. It is so crispy, and the sauce is amazing. And when they have it, I'll get the duck. As far as duck goes this place a pretty good job preparing it. Duck is usually very greasy, but they do a pretty good job, not the best I have ever had but close to. The egg drop soup is the best I have ever had though. The only problem I have had is the service, could use some work. Waited like 15 minutes to get the check, had to make it known to the waitress.\n",
      "This place deserves every star. Excellent service and even better food. Other Chinese food places in the area are fine but usually disappoint, somehow messing up a seemingly easy order. I find my self looking forward to the next time I stop by and see the extremely friendly AJKs staff again. My new favorite Chinese restaurant! Would highly recommend for family and close friends.\n",
      "Amazing! Clean, quiet, and the best Chinese food in town. I'm always so surprised they don't have more customers. I think it's because the exterior looks so small and non-descript from the outside. Once you walk into their dining area the ambiance is impressive. If you haven't tried it, you should. The West Valley's best kept secret.\n",
      "This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We got the dinner for 3 but everything we had was lacking flavor and they were the chefs selections.\n",
      "I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants, and this one was not impressive. They were cold but business friendly. I asked about an ingredient and they would not add it for an extra cost. Crab Rangoon is called a \"cheese puff\" and were ok. Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients. Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice. I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place. Too bad because its nice inside and clean.\n",
      "I was starving late one night. First problem, never make food choices when you're hungry - plan ahead. So I'm searching for anything that is open and I try this place out. Quick and easy - never again. First mapquest sends me in the wrong direction, then when I call for help the server tells me it's across from Lowe's? It would be clearer to say it's across from Walmart! I ordered Cheese Puffs (I should have known to change my order when I asked if the cheese puffs were wontons or rangoon and the lady on the phone said \"no cheese puffs\"). I half accepted some deep fried Chetto. But this was actually the only enjoyable part of the meal. Honey Sesame Shrimp was over cooked with little taste. It was suppose to come with shrimp fried rice but instead I was given tasteless brown rice and a vegetable spring roll that I never tried because the rest of the meal was so disappointing. This is in no way authentic and I bases on my experience it was barely good on a Sunday night. But maybe that's because I forgot to pray over it since I was so hungry. Only Pro: it helped me stay on my diet.\n",
      "Was not impressed. We ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35. Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good. They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy. Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots. Mapo tofu wasn't bad. I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested. Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch. I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it. Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship! Places like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!\n",
      "Brought my daughters here for the first time! It was very delicious and I'm addicted to the chicken egg rolls!\n",
      "\"This place is amazing. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best in the West Valley.\" Really? The best? I admit that, when it comes to Chinese food, there isn't much in the West Valley. Then again, unless we're talking Mexican, there isn't much in the West Valley ... period. It's been that way since I came out here in 1993; it'll probably be that way after I die of food poisoning from one of these stellar places (and after one of the restaurant owners I've reviewed reads one of my contributions, the \"food poisoning\" may not be so accidental or coincidental). First, I really like the nearly all-wood decor of the place. I know the \"fashion\" for those who aren't old and obsolete dinosaurs is plastic and glass. Whatever. I like wood. It gives a warm and cozy feeling and this place has it (the ceiling with twinkling stars ... ehhh ... it's okay). We had the family dinner for two. The price ($23.95 + tax without drinks) is reasonable. The Hot n Sour soup was tasty: filled with peanut oil just like the Hot n Sour Soup I'm used to from back East. A little light on the meat and a bit too sweet for my tastes, but acceptable. The egg rolls had nearly no meat and were very crisp. Frankly, I LIKE all-vegetable and crispy egg rolls and the tighter the cabbage is packed in, the better. Cheese puff ... okay. Wasn't supposed to be a \"crab puff\", so they're not trying to deceive and it was tasty. Now the main meal. This is where the place gets less \"amazing\". I had the Szechuan Chicken and am wondering if maybe they brought the wrong dish? I've never had a version of this dish, where the chicken was crispy coated and the sauce was sweet. My other half had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was, sadly, standard for second-rate Chinese restaurants: small cubes of celery, bamboo, zucchini ... and smaller cuts of, I think, chicken. Neither tasted bad; neither overwhelmed. Service was fast ... one might say, \"too fast\": in a take-out situation, you WANT them falling over each other. At a sit down meal, you really don't want them bringing courses before you're done with the previous one. As I said to my fellow diner, \"The only thing missing is them standing in a corner, watching expectingly and waiting to swoop down on us as we took our last bite.\" So, in conclusion, while I agree that the pickings in Avondale/Goodyear are slim, this is no excuse to tolerate something one step above the food court in Target. If you really think this place is something to give 4 or 5 stars to, then I beg you to either get in your car and drive the 20 miles into Phoenix to find something more palatable or, if you don't have a car, drop me a line and we'll go out to dinner one day. I'll consider it a civic duty and a generous gift to your taste buds.\n",
      "This place is great. Not only is the food delicious but the service is everything that you could hope for! I love this restaurant and would recommend it to EVERYONE\n",
      "OMG amazing! Love this place, always fresh food and the best spring rolls I've ever had in my life lol\n",
      "Good food, nice dining room, a little hard to find cause it's in a strip mall, but it next to the dollar store. Spring rolls have hint of cinnamon in them, not a fan of those, great Lo Mein though.\n",
      "I've been to AJK a number of times and it is always good. I've had the ma-po tofu, garlic chicken, and pad thai. I enjoyed the ma-po the most out of those three dishes - it had a thick and flavorful sauce that had me wanting more. The ingredients have always seem pretty fresh. The service was good. The interior of the place is done very nicely, they definitely put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the place. I am used to many Chinese places being completely bare bones in terms of interior, so this was a pleasant surprise. Also! on a side note, I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks. They only have milk tea and Thai tea, but both are really good.\n",
      "Awesome service and the food was fantastic! Was greeted immediately and even asked if we needed an outlet to charge my phone.\n",
      "We have visited AJK several times now and are very impressed. Fresh produce / food, good menu selection, reasonable pricing, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. My wife has tried several items and has really enjoyed them all, I really like the General Tso pork (yes pork, I had only seen chicken before). Be sure to look up when dining for your dinner under the stars! Keep up the good work down there at AJK!\n",
      "I really enjoyed this Chinese restaurant in Avondale. We had a lot of different items on the menu, and all were delicious. One great stand out at AJK is the amount of food you get for your money, Large dinner plates for a very reasonable price. Overall I would go to AJK again when wanting great affordable Chinese in this area of Arizona. Also be sure to check out the ceiling inside AJK, its like staring at a night sky filled with blinking stars... pretty unique.\n",
      "We were there on a Saturday late afternoon. Including us, there were only 6 customers. The service was pretty quick (3 different servers), they all helped out each other. Ok, here is the food comments: Thai Satay Chicken Skewers - they were dry, tough, and not grilled (I think it was fried). The peanut sauce that they were covered in was not peanutty enough. BBQ Pork Slices - the flavor was good and a little greasy, but the slices were inconsistent. You get super thin slices and they normal slices. Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side. We overhead the couple on the other side of us complain about their food. So, I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food. I would good back to Ono Hawaiian (fast food) which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian.\n",
      "I love this place! Great quality food, great service, large portions and fare prices. In the Fry's parking lot. Try the bbq pork egg foo young, mongolian beef and get the lo mein instead of rice. Good stuff.\n",
      "This restaurant does not exist at the stated location. I used GPS Navigation and everything, but there is nothing there but old houses.\n",
      "I'd have to say that I am definitely a fan of this place. Very small and kind of out of the way in the strip mall, but great nonetheless! We got takeout here all the time after work. The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :) We recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;) Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though. Oh, and the place is small, but very nice inside. Nice atmosphere... nothing spectacular, but it's comfortable and quiet. They also had 2 flat screen TVs that I saw, but I didn't really pay attention to what was on. Sports? idk.\n",
      "Food was nice and hot. Loved the crab puffs. Mongolian beef was a bit on the sweet side. Customer service was awesome!!!\n",
      "Very friendly place to grab some good Asian food. The staff is friendly and fast price great and they have really good hit and sour soup.\n",
      "Food is amazingly delicious!! Food is made really fast!! Place is very nice on the inside and staff very attentive. Everyone who goes to Panda should come give this place a try, you will love it. This place has high ratings for a reason!! Would recommend this place to everyone\n",
      "Finally! A wonderful place to get great Chinese food! The service is excellent and the food is exceptional. I ordered the Cashew Chicken and my husband ordered the Orange Chicken and both plates were super tasty and generous. I can never finish mine and I take the rest home for the next day and it's wonderful, even then. The employees are always willing to adapt a recipe to your needs and serve it with a smile. I really love this place and try to go as often as I can.\n",
      "Great SERVICE!!! Food was delicious but came out very hot! Restaurant is very clean and well maintained.\n",
      "We enjoy coming here. Nice variety and reasonably priced. Food tastes good and service is prompt.\n",
      "I absolutely love their lo mein and beef and broccoli! The vegetables are always so tender and full of flavor. This has become a regular place to eat for my family and we are never disappointed. I fell in love with their milk tea boba!! I even took one to go. The staff is always nice and friendly!! The only time i wasn't impressed was when we ordered the chicken wings. They were ao bland and flavorless and they just threw jalapeño slices on top. Other than that everything is delicious!!\n",
      "Got takeout from here several times and ate in the restaurant once. This is by far the best Chinese food in the area...Everything I've had is fresh and delicious. I usually go for the chicken and broccoli, and if you get it to go they'll give you enough food for 2 or 3 meals. I am still on a quest to find the perfect eggroll though...you know the big fluffy golden brown ones with pork and shrimp in them (I'm from NJ and that's what they're like there) and still no luck. But this place is a breath of fresh air considering the best Chinese food we had around here was Panda Express...and Chinese food shouldn't come from a fast food restaurant.\n",
      "We've tried their food at least half a dozen times and without fail it's been the best Asian food we've found in the valley. Every dish has been great, the portions are HUGE (they give you your order in a cardboard box!) and the lady that works the front is a sweetheart. I honestly can't come up with a single negative based on our experiences so far. Two snaps up!\n",
      "We have wasted so much money on chinese food in the valley!..grrrr. I read a review on yelp a couple weeks ago and have now eaten here twice! The food is very good. Im gluten intolerant and they do not hassle me when I ask for no soy sauce on my food. They even said I can bring my own. Im giving them a 4 because they do not offer gluten free breading or gluten free soy sauce for their meals. The ambiance is elegant and traditional looking..very pretty. They have bundle dinner specials, that is quite a savings. You can also substitute the white rice for noodles or brown rice for a small fee. I like that option because white rice is not the healthiest. If you have been frustrated looking for good chinese food in the west valley..come on down folks!..You will not be disappointed!!\n",
      "Great restaurant! Simply stated: 1. It's Clean 2. Friendly/Great Customer Service 3. Reasonably Priced 3. Outstanding Food (with large portions). What more can you ask for in a restaurant!\n",
      "This is one of the best Chinese food restaurants I've ever ate at. Everything I've ever tried here was delicious. Food always comes out hot and taste fresh. Best part you can dine in or take out, and did I mention it's always fresh and hottt :). The staff is always friendly and nice as well. This is the best and only chinese food I eat here in arizona since I moved here from Cali. Well atleast on the West side I don't go to the east side very often. I love their egg rolls and the Lo Mein Noodles, those are my favs, however the lunch special are a fabulous hit as well, price good and a enough to have left overs for later, I always order the #6 Garlic Chicken w/all noodles and a extra egg roll, because did I mention the noodles and egg rolls are my favs. So if your ever on the west side of town get off at Dysart and it's on the right side of Fry's. Even if your in a hurry did I mention Their Fasttt, I don't think I mentioned that :)\n",
      "First time visitors, and we were pleasantly surprised. The food is very tasty and reasonably priced. We were impressed with the many menu selections. We also like the atmosphere - a comfortable place. (The 'stars' are cool!) Service was very fast, however, we were there early (about 5pm) and there were not many patrons at that time on a weekday. We will be repeat customers.\n",
      "Very nice place clean service really good prices are affordable food excellent, atmosphere really good\n",
      "My boyfriend is taking me here tonight because we're celebrating something and I thought, \"all I want is Kenzo.\" Even if you have to wait- it's rarely for very long. I've had the seafood ramen (I forget the actual name of it and I picked the squid out), which gave me acid reflux but it was soooo good. I had the King of King Ramen which is spicy to say the least- but delicious. My favourite is the Wonton Ramen- it's not in the menu, but there's a poster of it on the wall. Best broth ever! At least as good as Kinton, only you don't have to wait 3 hours to get a seat.\n",
      "Admittedly, I'm not much of a ramen connoisseur but felt that this restaurant offers good quality ingredients, generous portions, and an inviting ambiance at an affordable price. If anything, the broth was a bit on the salty side, but perhaps that's just how it's supposed to be done. I had the king of kings ramen, which was just spicy enough to my liking and rich enough to satiate my hunger by the end of it.\n",
      "Kenzo Ramen is a great soup place. When I've had too much Pho, Kenzo is a great place to find an alternative to my staple soup eating patterns. I particularly love their big monster Ramen soup which I, unfortunately, can't remember the name. It's a huge bowl of mixed ingredients which is a great way to please my complexity loving pallet. Their food is very good, their prices are reasonable, and I've never had an issue with their service which is always prompt and polite. Although some say that you should never go to a soup place on a date, I would argue that Kenzo is a great option for such an occasion. :)\n",
      "I ordered tonkatsu don and agedashi tofu. Felt like eating rice instead of ramen today Food : 4/5 It's pretty good and decent, the portion is fairly medium. Service: 5/5 Everything came fairly quick, and all the staff are responsive. Price: 3/5 I think the tonkatsu don is a bit pricy.\n",
      "Kenzo Ramen thank you for popping my first ramen experience cherry! The location was great and just walking distance from Wellesley station. Service was quick and attentive. You have to wait a bit before you can eat your ramen, it was steaming hot! The broth was delicious! I thought the ramen was great but I was told later than Kenzo is middle of the road for Japanese standards. Despite being a ramen newbie, I will be back to Kenzo for a cheap dinner or lunch.\n",
      "5 stars for service 3 for ramen I came here with 4 friends at 10 pm and the kitchen has closed for the night, but they were able to open it up for 5 bowls of ramen. Yes! Excellent service. Charm and Aaron were amazing servers and didn't rush us even when we were holding them from leaving work. It's not the best ramen I've ever eaten but it does it job at 10 bucks a bowl and it's only 50 cents to add an extra egg.\n",
      "One of the few viable options on Dundas between Spadina and Yonge St., and a plausible destination at which to recharge after a day of horrible, horrible, but unavoidable shopping in the Eaton Centre or visiting the AGO if you don't want to venture into Chinatown, especially in the dead of winter. I've been twice, and I don't see why I won't be going back several times. The King of Kings ramen is rich, spicy, and chock full of crunch and tasty tidbits, including sliced and ground pork and a nice egg. The servings are *humongous* -- bring an appetite, or prepare to be defeated and exhausted as you dive into a bottomless bowl. The noodles are passable; I've certainly had better. My friend, who recently ate his way through Japan, said it compares favourably with what you'll get at most places there, and I would rate it just slightly lower than my favourite of all time, Saiwaii Ramen in SF. The Osaka octupus balls are *insanely* rich, and even six is far too many for two people, consisting as they do of soft cheese (I only found out later that this is what they are made of ... glad I didn't know before I ordered them ... also since when do Japanese dishes involve dairy?!?) doused in super-sweet teriyaki sauce. I loved the shaved dry octopus on top. Oddly, they were a little bit like small melted, spherical seafood okonomi (PS: see my review of Okonomi House for the genuine article). This is not a cheap fill-up, but it's probably the best value in this neighbourhood (which exploits suburban shoppers who don't want to venture too far from Yonge & Dundas when they come to town), and even worth a visit if you live elsewhere in the city. The tables are small, and it's pretty busy, so I can't really recommend it for a party of more than 2-3.\n",
      "I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the soup and the pork were great. The noodles not so much. And I also order Gyoza and they were amazing!! I would need to try other ramen to rate better, because they have plenty of types of different ramen. Definitely, I would recommend it!\n",
      "Yet to say I tried this out of the blue one cold winters day after shopping. I loved it the service was well eventho it was busy and the portion sizes for the noodle is well worth it. I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of this place.\n",
      "Broth is very nice (though a tad salty in my opinion). Noodles aren't chewy enough for my taste but still good. Meat and vegetables and such are pretty good.\n",
      "They messed up my order. Then you have to explain over and over again what they did wrong. And to top it up, they offend you and call you a liar. Apparently they can't do wrong. The worst service ever!\n",
      "Craving ramen for awhile since its hard for me to get good ramen in town. First stop visiting downtown Toronto was Kenzo Ramen. To be fair, from the outside it resembles any other ordinary ramen shop lined along Dundas Ave. While not completely Japanese owned, this place is able to hold its own and have a loyal fan base. I ordered the Tonkotsu, Broth was tasty and delicious, not to mention healthy. No MSG from what I can tell, noodles were firmly cooked, not too soft or mushy. Portions were just right, satisfying and filling but not overly wasteful in portion wise. Would recommend going back.\n",
      "I usually go to the one in Mississauga but this location is great too. I love ramen and i can't remember the one i always get but all of them are delicious! I like how their chopsticks are not the cheap wooden ones. The matcha smoothie is not that good but i think its more on how it was done\n",
      "Came upon this place by accident, as I was visiting 401 Games located next door, and decided to give it a try. Overall I would say this place is a fairly standard when it comes to ramen; the pork was tender, the egg was not overcooked, the noodles were nice and chewy. I had their King of Kings ramen and the broth was flavourful but missing that depth and richness you get from a really good broth, but again it was overall decent - the ramen itself also had lots of other stuff in it as well (veggies, seaweed, ground pork). The service was quick and friendly, although I was one of two tables eating at that time. There are definitely better ramen places in the city, but overall Kenzo is not bad if you want a quick bite in the area.\n",
      "This place is alright - portions are bigger than Santosei but quality is lower than that of Kinton. In a pinch, it should do to quelch any ramen cravings.\n",
      "Not real Japanese food including donburi and ramen. Service is not that good. But the taste is not so bad. I will still go there for a quick lunch\n",
      "Tried Kenzo for the first time yesterday. Went to the 522 Yonge location. There was no lineup at 5:15 pm (yay!). Had the miso based Ramen. It was good. The broth was delicious and the pork was very good. I will definitely go back and try the other varities. I was so happy to see that every other patron in the restaurant was Japanese or Korean. So I am taking that as a sign of authenticity.\n",
      "After a long exhausting walk my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to something special. We decided to give kenzo ramen a try. We ordered Sho-yu Ra-men (7.95) and The King of Kings Ramen (12.95). The broth for Sho-yu was nice and tasty and the ramen noodle was made very nicely. Rather disappointed overall though, The king of kings ramen had a tasteless instant noodle tasting broth. It was as if someone mixed water with chill oil. The waitresses were leaning on ambivalent about serving us seriously. Let me assure you downtown has a lot of options, Will not be coming back.\n",
      "Decided to have dinner here tonight after walking around aimlessly looking for a place to eat! I live around the area and did not even know this place existed along Yonge Street! I had the sho-yu ramen and it tasted great, it wasn't too salty, it was just right. The customer service wasn't the best but I'll give the guy a break as he was the only server. Prices are pretty reasonable, my ramen was $7.95!\n",
      "Kenzo is a great ramen place in Toronto that rarely ever has line ups and the service is super quick. I usually frequent the Bloor location, but the first one I tried was the Yonge Street spot. The place is pretty clean inside and looks like your standard ramen house decor. The staff are friendly, but you'll have to call them over at times as they are usually busy with the kitchen or serving. The ramen here is a little greasy, but the taste is pretty good. The broth isn't as clean as I'm used to with places like Kinton and Sansotei taking over as my favourites. Also the various toppings aren't cooked as well or as delicately as those shops I've mentioned. They add more of a Chinese flare with their vegetables and toppings over the traditional Japanese ramen, but it works well. If I'm in a pinch and need to get something quick to eat Kenzo is a good place to go. the ramen portions are also the largest out of any other ramen shops in the GTA and their fried dumplings will fill you up alone. The price is right and the food is good, so definitely give this place a try.\n",
      "Simply the BEST ramen in town and gyoza was delicious too! I'm just not a fan of the place. It's quite an uncomfortable awkward narrow place so may not work if you have a big group. But I would still go back for some awesome ramen.\n",
      "I love Ramen, but this place wasn't anything particularly special. The price is right, the place is clean and the servers were nice. When it comes right down to the food though, I wouldn't recommend it any more readily than other options for a good soup in the area.\n",
      "Not bad, comfortable enough seating and the ramen was tasty. It also came out super fast. I'm no ramen afficionado by any stretch, but I enjoyed my meal.\n",
      "great ramen, fast but nice service\n",
      "It was a bit expensive, but it is a really good soup. Definitely a lot better than anything at pacific mall. There are vegetarian options so yay!. I'm vegan so they were kind enough to remove the noodles and substitute with more bean sprouts and rice on the side.\n",
      "My roommate and I came here before Nerd night for a quick snack. We both opted for the King of King Ramen. I like Ramen and it was decent with alot of textures, including the egg, the noodles, the pork and the seaweed. Broth was okay with a bit of bite. It was good and filling but I will keep looking for other options!\n",
      "Enjoyed eating there for the first time with couple of friends, the ramen was pretty good for the price. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area.\n",
      "If you're looking for a simple and good tasting noodle soup dish, this is the place to go. The kitchen operates well and seems to be able to fulfill orders quite quickly. Prices for the ramen dishes are also fair, if not very affordable. I would recommend going with their recommended menu options as they truly are delicious!\n",
      "My girlfriend and I came here on February 24 at around 2PM. When we arrived, the place wasn't that packed and only 3 tables were filled. After we sat down, a mob of people came in and almost half of the restaurant was filled! After we were seated, we took a quick glance at the menu and decided what to order. Our waitress was very attentive and took our orders promptly. I went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood) and my girlfriend went with \"The Kings of the Kings Ramen\" (she's so fancy)! I also ordered the Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. My green tea smoothie took about 10 minutes to come out and it was kind of too bland for me. It had a milky but not too sweet green tea taste. It was good, but just not my kind of drink. Our food came out probably around 15 minutes after we ordered it, which isn't too bad. My seafood ramen was awesome, mostly because I love seafood and the soup base tasted great. It came with a decent amount of seafood (Shrimp, scallops, and mussels) and noodles. One minor complaint I have is that the shrimp should be unshelled, this makes it easier to eat especially when eating ramen...or maybe I'm just picky! As for my girlfriend (she's a picky eater), she thought that it was just okay. They could have gave less toppings, primarily the bean sprouts because it seemed like there were more of that than noodles. Another thing is that she didn't like the smokey flavor of the pork, but that depends on your taste. One thing that we both agree on is that the noodles had a great texture to it, it was an awesome smooth and soft texture. As for the service, I thought our waitress did a great job. She accommodated with our requests and was very attentive. She came back often enough to not annoy us, but enough for us to request items if we needed. Our ramens didn't come out quick, but it wasn't so long that we would complain. We also got a coupon for 5$ off 25$ the next time we visit :) Overall, I had a great time and meal at Kenzo. If I am ever in the Toronto area, I would definitely come back here and try the other ramen. Not only was the is service great, the food was delicious as well. Definitely a place to check out if you're around the Toronto-Downtown area.\n",
      "Well this place is good, but I don't understand the high ratings. I found their soup to be slightly salty and the portions somewhat small for the price. But like the other reviews mention, the service was EXCELLENT. Super attentive staff.\n",
      "LOVED this place!! Everyone was super friendly, and we even chatted with a couple that was seated nearby. So, there's a ramen contest here-eat an entire bowl at a level 20 in regards to its spiciness, and get it for free. Our server warned us that it was REALLY spicy, so I got a level 2 (I was sweatin' a bit, to tell you the truth! And I always get spicy ramen that never tastes that spicy!!) with pork and mushrooms, and my boo got a level 6 (I think that was the 1st tier haha). He was dying and I had a few spoonfuls and YES, it was THAT spicy. But it was still tasty, at least! We also got an order of the gyoza, which was huge size wise!\n",
      "I love soups and sometimes ignorance can truly be bliss. I know my way around Pho's and Pork Bone soups, however Ramen, I can't say much except that I enjoy them. As such, I do happen to like Kenzo. Both times I have been there, the new location has been mostly empty --including dinner time here, so I would take most people don't know about this location yet, even though it is listed on their website. The first time I was there I had a Netsu Ramen which --with limited experience found to be very tasty. The second time I had their Orochong ('cause youth love it ;-) ...which I found good but I actually preferred their Netsu better. Mind you that is a matter of taste, not quality. On a positive note, the waiter came after our meal and asked what we thought of it. If perhaps it was too salty or if there was anything they could do to improve the dish.... WHAT? Really? For better or worse, I cannot even remember when was the last time I was asked that in a restaurant. It was appreciated, however due to my lack of Ramen experience, I really could not give any meaningful feedback. As far as quality, I could not how \"authentic\" it was. I could only assume that it is not. But unlike places like Pho88, where their pho is neither authentic or that well made, this simile of Ramen was quite delicious given it's lack of authenticness. If you have never been to Japan then I very much recommend this place. However if you HAVE been to Japan, chances are that you know better and probably just come her because the selection in Canada is so slim. Having said that, I will keep an eye for other Ramen places to expand my palette. However next time I go back, I will have check out the King Ramen.\n",
      "I really have never paid so much for a bowl of noodles!! 2 bowls of noodles and an appetizer for $45! I could've gone to an all you can eat restaurant for that price! And u wasn't very impressed with my noodles. There wasn't much to it. Some noodles, some ground pork, some extremely salty broth...... It was suppose to be spicy but was far from it. The takoyaki balls were pretty good though......hence the two stars!\n",
      "We didn't try the ramen, but we had the Gyoza and Takoyaki. The dishes were fine, but not surprisingly delicious. Maybe we expected too much. People who know Toronto well said they won't suggest this restaurant as a good place for Ramen.\n",
      "Amazing service and food. Place is well maintained and has AC - so bless. The portions are perfect and very filling- and that's coming from a person who can eat a lot. Warning the portions are big for the more expensive ramen. The cheaper ramen are still filling though even if you're pretty hungry. Good taste and perfectly chewy noodles.\n",
      "Decent ramen although cannot compare to Sansotei. Its cheaper and good for lunch, noodles and broth are only average. I did really like their onigiri but they're really small.\n",
      "It is opened by Chinese people so technically it is Chinese way of Ramen...so, having a semi-cooked noodle is not a surprise...I left half of the bowl there...and those 2 stars are for the dumpling, which is fully cooked....if I have to give its ramen a star, I would give a -2! Go there for dumpling or DanDan noodle if you are really out of options, but not Ramen...\n",
      "Because there is no half point, I gave five points. It worths 4.5 points. I like their ramen variations. I had Tonkotsu ramen and it was good. The soup base was port bone and it was yummy. One of my group had Yakisoba and it seemed really delicious. It's impressive to have a good Japanese ramen in the heart of Toronto and the price is also reasonable. It is recommended, definitely.\n",
      "Really recommend Nagasaki!!! Green tea latte is really really good, but way too expensive for what you get!\n",
      "The Kenzo chain in general is \"OK\". Don't let that deter you, I don't mean to attach any negative connotations with \"OK\", I really really just mean it's OK. Considering ramen options in Toronto in general, it's pretty good. I like the atmosphere of this Kenzo a little more than the other ones. It's easier to be seen by waiters than the one on Dundas and it feels less gaudy than the one on Bloor. Every time I've been there it's also been quieter, with parties usually from 1~4 people. This might be why the waitresses are sometimes distracted talking to each other though, and they don't notice if you're looking expectantly their way with your meal done right away. I usually just opt for their more basic ramens. My main complaint about Kenzo ramen is it's got too much going on. Too many bean sprouts, too much saltiness to the broth, etc. I can't taste that hearty pork bone flavour in the tonkotsu ramen as well as at J-Town because of this. As a solution I always order shoyu or shio ramen and water down the broth with some water. If you're a ramen newbie, don't worry, the food is still pretty good. If you're picky about your ramen, you may not be too impressed by Kenzo, but it's not too bad, especially when you're really craving some ramen.\n",
      "Kenzo Ramen is beginner level ramen. It's what \"california rolls\" are to sushi. If you've never had ramen in a restaurant before (as I haven't), it's a good place to start. I can definitely now imagine the levels of complexity a ramen bowl could reach - just not so much here. Things I liked: the service. Such good service!! Really 5 stars for that. I liked my matcha smoothie, although it could have been more liquidy. I did like the ramen, but it did have a \"one-note\" broth and the toppings weren't so insanely delicious. Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but next time I want ramen, I wouldn't choose Kenzo, I would choose to go to one of the many popular joints I keep reading about.\n",
      "Lots of flavour, the freshness can tasted, and very quick and pleasant staff. Alot of the places on young around this area are still hit and miss, but this is a sure keeper if they keep the quality up and the prices under $12. Only thing I missed was some free kimtchi to calm the hunger during the wait.\n",
      "This place is pretty decent. I really don't know what makes this place stand out to be honest. The restaurant itself is decent, the ramen is decent, the service is decent, and the prices are, again, decent. It's nothing to write home about. I wouldn't choose this place to introduce my friends to ramen or anything like that. It's a decent place to eat if you're in the Bloor-Spadina area, but if you've got a better place in mind, I'd go for that instead.\n",
      "The Netsu ramen I ordered was full of flavour and had generous amounts of ground pork, vegetables, and noodles. The noodles were chewy, and the pork was marinated just right. One real downside to my noodles was that although they tasted amazing, my throat is reeling from the sodium and I've downed several glasses of water as a result. The decor is quite nice as well. Since it was early on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was half-empty and relatively quiet. The tables are well-proportioned so that you don't bump elbows with everybody at your table. Wait staff were friendly, and had the initiative to ask when we were ready to order, whether we'd like a glass refill, and how we enjoyed our meal.\n",
      "#detox ...... will not go again Takoyaki tasted nice.. but something is wrong with the pork in ramen..\n",
      "本來打算跟朋友到日式放題的餐廳享用晚餐，但是發現我們原本想去的那餐廳要等位，那我們只好到對面街的這家拉麵店吃晚餐。普通拉麵（鹽拉麵、醬油拉麵和麵豉拉麵）的價錢都比我預算中的便宜。由於我那晚非常餓，我點了鹽拉麵之後就加一元吧我的拉麵份量加大。雖然這家餐廳所選用的麵條是幼面，但是吃起來後感也不錯，但我自己本身是比較鍾情粗麵條的。鹽湯底不但不太鹹而且挺容易入口。吃完整碗拉麵之後我感到非常滿足和飽滿，整個身體也立馬暖了起來。如果大家是在找普通、飽肚的拉麵的話這家店是不錯的，但是如果大家是在找日本質素拉麵的話那我就會建議大家去其他的拉麵店享用。\n",
      "Ordered the Unagidon for $14.95 which includes salad and miso soup. The eel was fairly good, but I still think it lacks a bit of taste. Service was really good considering we were really loud and didn't got kicked out. The waitress was nice and patient with us, answering all our questions like a professional.\n",
      "Actually I will not say it gave me very strong impression. Ramen was average, price was a little high than I expected. Environment is also average. I will not say I recommend or not, but if you walk by and never try it before, then you can give a try.\n",
      "I got the Netsu ramen in medium and boy was it spicy! Next time I'm getting mild. It was still decent although I'm not a fan of the noodles. Decent portion size. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen as well and I preferred that. The broth and meat were delicious in that one. It seemed a bit small especially for the price.\n",
      "Kenzo is a Ramen chain store in Toronto. I think it is good if you crave ramen but do not want to wait. I never had to wait for a seat at Kenzo and the food comes pretty quickly (under 10mins every time). It is a good fast food. As far as authenticity goes, it is not that authentic, it has some chinese food elements in it. The broth is ok, it is definitely less flavorful than Santouka or Sansotei, but Kenzo is also much cheaper, gives you more food, and you have no wait. It is also close to my home, so during cold winter nights it rakes points for convenience. The servers are always friendly and polite and service is prompt. It is clean. The noodles are the wheat types and are decent, most times it is not overcooked. Overall a good place for a decent, quick and cheap meal, but do not expect mind blowingly great ramen here.\n",
      "With a sudden ramen craving that fell upon me, I decided to check out where the closest ramen joint to my work was with my handy dandy Yelp app. Luckily for me, Kenzo was less than 5 minutes away, hurrah! You may not notice Kenzo if you're not looking for it, it's easy for smaller spots to get lost in the hustle & bustle of Yonge St, I find! Service here is easily 5 stars. My waitress was super sweet, attentive, and friendly. Lots of solo eaters and small tables, so if you are popping by on a quick solo lunch, or even just wandering the area solo looking for a bite to eat, Kenzo is ideal. I went with the Tonkotsu ramen (which came within MINUTES of me ordering! Wow! Talk about speedy!) which was tasty, though I felt the pork could have used a bit more seasoning. Minus a few points because a.) I think the floor must have been very recently washed because it was quite wet and I almost slipped walking to my table - no signs warning about this - eep! & b.) Got unlucky with a wobbly table (those drive me bonkers!) All in all a solid 3.5/5. One of the better lunch spots in the area, not to mention some of the best service. I will most certainly be back!\n",
      "I was recommended to go here by a friend who enjoys it here. They have several locations so I am going to go on the assumption that quality may vary based on where you are. I'm going to flat out say that I did enjoy my experience here and I really did enjoy it. I had more than enough food at my disposal and I left a full man upon completion of my meal. I think the pricing is on point, any more would be theft and any less....would also be theft come to think of it. It was a bit grungy but there isn't anything wrong with that if you can get past it and the food is great. What I really liked about it was that there is a heavy emphasis on vegetarian options that are available which is great! It's rare to see in a ramen place which focuses typically on pork, chicken and beef broths. I do reccomend this place to all. There are better ramen joints in the city for sure, but this is DEFINITELY one of the better places for sure\n",
      "The food was excellent as well as the service, especially on a cold night. Got a ramen Bowl, gyoza and onigiri and all were delicious. My girlfriend got the yakisoba and she said it was quite tasty (it certainly looked good). Would definitely come back here\n",
      "I love ramen and ramen for $7 is awesome in my books. It's fast to get the food, fast to eat, tasty, delicious and cheap. I highly recommend the pork bone soup.\n",
      "So today I visited Kenzo Ramen Noodle house on Dundas Street West for lunch .I enjoyed the seafood ramen noodle soup it was okay but nothing special it looked much better than it tasted. I had a level 2 spice factor, wasn't very hot at all ....maybe next time I'll try level 3. My waitresses were very friendly and very attentive. I did not like the actual restaurant itself .....it felt too small and too cluttered and I didn't like the open kitchen concept ....I don't like to see my food being prepared as it kind of grosses me out. I definitely will be going back again I want to try some of the other soups that they have available I definitely want to try the level 3 heat factor soup that they advertise and everyone gushes about. For my stupid one Sapparo beer my meal came up to about $22 kind of expensive for lunch especially when I'm eating by myself. So no real complaints I'll be back!\n",
      "There was a time where I absolutely loved Kenzo as it was the only ramen choice in downtown..... Now that kinton and sansotei and others will be in town, the bar is a bit higher and....meh, Kenzo's alright. Too skimpy on the pork, but the rest of the toppings are tasty. Would eat there when I'm lazy since I live nearby but would rather trek to Kinton on a nice day.\n",
      "Been a while since I had Japanese food that wasn't sushi. Also been a while since I've had anything spicy. I fixed both those issues at once with this place. Reasonably price with very friendly and kind hearted staff that create some of the best Ramen this side of the Pacific. I had the spicy bowl and they have three levels of spice. I chose the lowest one and was still sweating by the time I was done though I did have some level 2 as dipping on the side. Keep in mind I am a lightweight when it comes to spicy food right now. They have about 20 or so different dishes, mostly in the ramen soup variety. Either spicy or non, also vegi is available for most. They have non bowls as well I didn't have them so don't know how they stack up.\n",
      "Ramen for less than $10? This is definitely the option for it. There are a few options under $10 here, like the Miso Ramen (7.95), the Shoyu ramen (7.95), and some of the spicy rames that for 8.95. So if you're craving ramen and not too picky of the taste, not a bad choice. I picked the Miso ramen, and it was quite meh. The broth is fine, the noodles are fine, the meat was fine. Nothing was \"bad\" but I don't come for ramen to feel \"fine\". The ramen comes with 3 pieces of pork, a piece of seaweed, and a little bunch of bean sprouts. I kept thinking....where's my egg! My BF ordered the dippable ramen, which was much better. I think it was about $12.95? But the dipping sauce was delicious, and came with the half egg, and a more flavourful pork than mine. I ended up stealing some of his dipping sauce to upgrade my ramen a bit. All in all....everything is fine. But for better ramen (albeit more expensive), there's some only steps away up and down Yonge St.\n",
      "The king ramen had a lot of stuff and delicious but too spicy for my taste. Couldn't enjoy the noodles due to this. The rest of the menu didn't seem very appetizing and the yaki soba was too sweet. More fast food tasting.\n",
      "Came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. The gyoza was simply amazing. The meat to wrapper ratio was absolutely spot on and worth the $9. Loved that they were pan fried and came with 2 saucers of dipping sauce! I ordered the King of Kings Ramen bowl and that was extremely filling and satisfying. The noodles were cooked perfectly and was neither mushy nor too underdone. The broth could've been spicer (will ask it to be spicer next time) but was well balanced otherwise. Only complaint was their liberal use of salt. Staff were swift and courteous, refilled our water glasses without being asked. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "The food isn't bad. Unfortunately the service is just not there. Rushed out of dinner and wouldn't even take dessert order when there are still other to let there. Not to mention I told the waiter when I started. Probably won't go back.\n",
      "Enjoyed myself thoroughly! Waitress was very kind, not much interaction though which was fine. Ramen was tasty but subtle. They were nice enough to give me a side of minced chilli to put into my bowl for some heat. Will be coming back for sure.\n",
      "Ramen is hitting this city like a nuclear explosion (too soon?) I haven't tried many of the new ramen joints so I can't compare, but for a reasonably priced and (up until now) unique soup in the core I recommend either of Kenzo's locations. The menu is small and simple. You'll be getting ramen noodles in soup with a variety of extra, some spicy, some savoury. If you order a non-spicy dish they'll happily bring you their chili powder to bring it up to taste. Again, I'm no expert, but I happen to think their tacoyaki is top notch. Love it. Great in the winter when you're looking to warm up or if you want to clear your sinuses....or really just anytime because it's delicious.\n",
      "It's good salty Ramen but as a meal you should order 2 bowls because its basically all noodles and very little meat or veggies. There is so much salt that I taste it in my mouth for the rest of the day.\n",
      "THE KING is a great soup.. Dundas location is SUPERIOR... The decor/setting. Yonge location had really bad dancey/pop music playing, way way too loud and completely ODD for the environment, completely annoying. In the end a one time visit. Stick to the BLOOR or DUNDAS spots. simply better...\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Japanese ramen consider its something my mom has made since I was young. Nothing like having a hot bowl of noodles and delicious toppings on a cold day. I've frequented the dundas location and the yonge st. one. Both are very good, but here's my thoughts on this loc. I've ordered in the past the tonkotsu, sho-yu, shi-yo, miso and one last one I can't remember. PRO - Much more spacious than the dundas location, so getting a seat is less of a hassle - Less busy when I went here (around 7:30) so serve was prompt - Can't say food was much different, but again consistently good for a fair price CON - Not positive, but I thought the matcha iced latte was made better at the dundas location The Sho-yu is my fav and good if you don't want something too big. The tonkotsu is also delicious but much more filling. This chain is surprisingly decent considering the people who run it are not Japanese.\n",
      "Good ramen chain a variety of ramen. Tried the seafood ramen and the tonkotsu ramen. The seafood ramen had great seafood flavor and plenty of shellfish. The tonkotsu ramen was fine. They didn't use the thin white noodles that would be traditional for richer broths like tonkotsu. The pork was a slice of plain shoulder. The broth itself was not as rich and didn't have the collagen it should have had. Good ramen especially if you in the mood for it and many locations around Toronto.\n",
      "I'm a huge ramen fan and I was disappointed when I went to Kenzo yesterday. I had the Kings of King Ramen with a spicy level 2/3. It was really spicy though I'm Chinese and can take a quite a lot of hotness. Moreover, mushrooms and meat in the soup tasted smoky, not in a good way. They tasted like they were over cooked and the fire was way too hot for them. Overall, I don't think I will ever go back there.\n",
      "This is some of the best ramen in the city, and they serve Takoyaki to boot! I was so happy to discover there was a location in my neighbourhood in addition to the one near my work. This Kenzo is a little small and crowded, but the ramen is just as tasty as at the Bloor location.\n",
      "I like Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and the king of the kings ramen, the soup of Tonkotsu is better than the king of kings, but king of kings is like a value pack, you have everything in it and the quantity is big.\n",
      "Kenzo Ramen is the same as the Japanese Noodle House Chain. I tried the Sapporo Miso Ramen at $10.95. The description of the dish is very accurate. The dish consisted of very rich miso soup base with mixed stir fried veggies. There is a choice of pork or chicken slices as well as a vegetarian option. I chose chicken and was very pleased. I went at lunch time just at opening. Service was excellent. I would definitely return to try the other ramen dishes especially in the winter or any time I need a rich hot soup to warm the insides.\n",
      "Well fair price for ramen. Very friendly waitress and fast service! Would recommend this to friends!\n",
      "Great food and service... We ordered few sups and octopus appetizer and everything was absolutely amazing.. I highly recommend this place\n",
      "This Kenzo Ramen seems to be solo eater's heaven! Not only it has tons of tables for 2 which are perfect for single, there were in fact 5 tables of single while I was eating there. Wait staffs are a lot friendlier than the other locations I been to, especially the Dundas location. My Netsu Ramen ($8.95) level 3 spicy also a lot spicier than the one I had in other locations?! The noodles were chewy and cooked al dente.....really warmed me up on this cold winter's night! Another great Ramen location if I have a Ramen Attack!!\n",
      "Wasn't the best ramen I've had in Toronto - I like Sansotei (on Dundas) better. However, they have a lot more options to choose from, so if you want a variety of ramen, come here. I prefer Tonkotsu or pork bone broth based soup, and I thought Sansotei or Santouka does a better job with the soup base. The noodles itself were good but the meat was average -- it could have been more flavorful. One of the must get items here is the fried gyozas. They were much larger than expected and were very flavorful. Didn't really enjoy the octobus balls. Service was mediocre since my gyozas and octopus didn't come out until after my friend and I finished our ramen. Had we not asked them about it, I think they would have forgotten about them!\n",
      "I freaking love Ramen. Authentic Ramen. But since I am no longer flying to Japan every weekend, I'm a beggar and not a chooser now, am I? And what are ramen beggars left with? Kenzo. This new location used to be the home of Bowl, a pan Asian restaurant (and shall I mention I served there for a while? ha). The new owners did not change much in terms of layout/design. The location gets + points because it is simply much more spacious than the Dundas location, but - points because it feels a little less like a Ramen House and even less authentic (wow didn't know that was possible). Food is alright; the menu is identical to the Dundas one. I could go on and on about how ramen in Toronto is just not good enough and too expensive (I am SUCH a ramen snob, even bigger than I am a sushi snob)... but seriously when my choices are as slim as Kenzo or Ajisen, I still regularly - albeit half-assedly - satisfy my cravings at Kenzo. Now I just have a location that is even closer to my home! In terms of side dishes, they are really average. I would recommend to just stick to the noodles, and don't try their \"fancy\" green tea drinks either. My personal favourites are always Miso, and Tonkotsu. But guys, you really gotta go to Japan. Atmosphere - 2/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 3/5 Price - 3/5\n",
      "Once in a lifetyme, you freaking suck! How could you have it in you to take my money two days before you would be theives in the night and leave me with no dress and no money?! You ripped and pissed me off! I really hope you owners get whats coming to you! hopefully I can get some of the other women that you ripped off together to start a lawsuit!! Best believe Im bringing the heat to you! I recommend this place to NO ONE, that is if its still around. Karma is the biggest bitch out there so watch your heads!\n",
      "I bought my wedding dress here. I thought what a great opportunity. I can get a great deal on a nice designer dress. What I didn't know was that there were some strings attached which included delayed delivery dates, poor service, no phone call backs, and getting the wrong thing when I ordered something different. So my story with this business starts when I bought my dress. I was quoted 4-6 months for my dress to arrive .when six months came I had not heard anything so I called the company and they said it should be arriving in the next two weeks. Well two weeks came and went and I didnt hear anything so I called again. They told me any day now it should be in. A week past and no word. So this time I went into the store to get an answer, while at the store I was told my dress wasn't suppose to come in until aug. Which is 1 year after I ordered it. I told that would not work because I was quoted earlier and I needed it for alterations. So after me dealing with them I lost all my patience so My wedding planner called and she was ignored so finally my mother called and threatened credit card fraud because she had put down half for this dress and we had nothing to show for the huge sum of money we had paid. Bottom line they had charged our card and we had nothing to show for it and none of the promises they said were being followed thru with. After eight months I finally got my dress. All I can't say is I am happy i planned so far in advance. I also ordered a veil from them and when I went to pick it up it was a completely wrong. It was nothing like what i ordered . At this point all I wanted was my money back for the veil, Before the veil came in my fiancé, groomsmen, and fathers went to ordered their tux. They had no idea how to measure them. It was a group of seven and they had to wait 20 mins before anyone even helped them. They had put the deposit down for the tux but to be honest I am so tired of dealing with them that I am going to walk away from my deposit money and take my business else where. My advice for anyone thinking of going here for anything----- DON'T. It will give you a huge headache. Paying a little more at another store is very much worth it in the long run.\n",
      "Geez! Where to start with the headaches!! I would give this place of business a HALF STAR!!!!!! This place is soooo un-organized and the employees are soooo rude that I still can't believe they are still in business!!! I ordered my bridal dress in January of 2010 they told me I would get it by March, March comes around then they said May, then they said finally will get it by June. My dress came extremely wrinkled and when I wanted to try it on none of they employees bothered to help me out!! They just pointed to where the fitting rooms were. On top of that as I was paying for the remainder they wanted to charge me an additional charge for the custom bag to protect the dress!! Also, the place a business had an auction for wedding stuff and the bids were super cheap but as we were ready to check out they charged $30 each item for shipping tax!!! and they would not ship to your home only to the business. SUCH A RIP OFF!!!!! In addition to that, I called a month later to check on my order, they said my purchases were not ready yet, MONTH 2 I CALL AGAIN STILL NOT READY!!! MONTH 3 TWO ITEMS WERE READY. MONTH 4 THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS THERE I SHOW UP, STILL NO RING PILLOW OR FLOWER BASKET!!!! MONTH 5 FINALLY WALK IN EXPECTING TO YELL AND ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK, WHAT A SURPRISE MY STUFF WAS THERE ALL DUSTY!!! THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS!!! AND THE OWNER IS EXTREMELY RUDE MONEY HUNGRY BEEEP!! I RANK THIS PLACE 1/2 STAR!!!\n",
      "Terrible Customer Service! This store has a completely incompetent staff including the manager Rebecca. I took notes of all of my dealings with them specifically so that I could write this review. I called 12 times in March and April of 2011 and was always put on hold for over 10 minutes. I left messages for Rebecca or Anna (who sold me my dress) to call me back since everyone I got on the phone (usually Cherish) was unable to tell me where my dress was, when it would be shipped, when it would arrive, or how to put a rush (which I said I would pay for) on the dress. No one ever called me back. Three times I was given information (that my dress was shipped when a week later they said that it had not shipped etc.) that turned out to be false. They are no better in person, but rude, unapologetic, and almost unbelievably incompetent.\n",
      "Please be aware that every positive review on the internet is almost certainly a lie made by the owners/employees of Once in a Lyfe Time Bridal or their friends and families. This is a dishonest, disreputable business that should have gone out of business by now. Note that the people posting the positive reviews on various sites have all of the following in common: Similar writing styles, only one review, all made on similar dates, etc. My wife is the maid of honor to-be at my sister-in-law's wedding and she has gotten the complete run around by these liars. She has been told no less than 4 different dates when her dress would be in (beginning in early February, it is now March 1). Each time, something happened where the dress wasn't ready. We've now been promised the dress by March 4. This will be the 5th promised date. The wedding is 4 weeks away. They did offer 20% off alterations, but I wouldn't trust them to cut the crust off my sandwich, much less do good timely alteration work. Plus, their alteration prices are already indefensibly high. My wife also received the same lie that many others here report, that it was \"UPS's fault\" somehow. This seems to be part of Once in a Lyfe Time's business model. They have all of their standard lies. I wouldn't be surprised if they were written down somewhere. Also, the girls who work there don't give customers their real names. I don't know if this is because they are ashamed to work there, or don't want anyone contacting them outside of work to yell at them for their unacceptable business practices, but they sometimes forget their fake names and will start saying their real names before remembering to lie. Managers either don't exist or are never in the store. These are BAD PEOPLE and they are liars, and you will get screwed. Take your business somewhere else and be wary of any positive reviews of this place, as they are almost surely planted reviews made by the professional liars at Once in a Lyfe Time. My name is Chris, and if you want to hear more about my experience, shoot me an e-mail at csuffeco@yahoo.com.\n",
      "I don't know how these people are still open. I wish I would have done my research. I'll try and keep it short bc there are PLENTY of bad reviews already on here: Ordered my dress in January and paid in full that day. Was promised my dress in May for my July 31st wedding. No word from the salon throughout May and into first week of June. Called 1st week of June. Left message - no return call. 3 days later called again. Girl said \"dress has shipped, should be here any day.\" TWO more WEEKS go by with no word from salon. Begin calling again - everyday. No answer. No answering machine. Finally drive down there. Girl (owner's daughter) tell me the dress has yet to be shipped bc the manager hasn't called the manufacturer to \"have the dress released.\" Why did they tell me it had been shipped 2 weeks ago when it hadn't? Why hadn't it been released when it was promised in May? More weeks of this back and forth go by. NEVER receiving a call from the place. I finally called them July 1st (wedding is in 3 weeks at this point) and it had arrived. I drove down to pick it up. They didn't offer a single solitary apology nor any amends for the tardiness of the dress or lack of professionalism and lack of communication. They offered nothing. Even tried to send the gown home with me without a bag \"because they were out of bags.\" I made them give me a bag from one of the dresses on the rack. I hope these reviews save others from the displeasure of working with this horrific business. I'm afraid the owners really do deserve to go out of business.\n",
      "My fiancee ordered her wedding dress in February, paid half up-front and was told it would be ready by July. It has now been seven months, and they still don't know where it is. The only answer they can give us is \"I'll call the manufacturer\". This is easily the worst customer service I've ever had in dealing with a retailer.\n",
      "If I could rate this store a zero I absolutely would. Hands down the worst experience with a bridal shop I have ever encountered! DO NOT USE THEM if you value honesty and accurate results. I ordered my bridesmaid dress on February 20th which was a Sunday, so I was instructed to call them back on Monday so that they could contact the designer for timeframes. I called on Monday and was told that the dress would not be in until the first week in May if I did not put a rush on it, so I told them that I would need the rush because the wedding is out of town on May 16th, They said they woud add to my order and that my dress would be in the first week in April. I did not hear from them the first week in April, so I placed my first of many calls to them on 4/12. I was told that the dress had not come in yet, but that they would call the manufacturer and call me back; no one called. I called again on 4/13 and they said that the dress would ship the following Monday and would be in by the end of the next week (4/21-22) and they would call when it came in. I called again on 4/25 because I had not heard back YET AGAIN and they said that it didn't come over the weekend, but that it would be in the afternoon shipment and would call when they got it. AGAIN no call back, so called again on 4/26 not in said they would call manufactuerer and call back. Nothing. Called again 4/27 spoke to Cherish - no one ever contacted the manuf. would call me back. by noon, but didn't get a call so called again and they said it was shipping, but they were not allowed to release tracking numbers, so I asked to speak to manager (Rebecca) who was \"out running errands and would call me back\", but never did. This same back and forth went on until Saturday 4/30 when I finally had to have my husband take over the phone calls because they said that my dress had been delivered to a PUB in Tempe somewhere and they couldn't find it. They finally found it that afternoon and I had the bride go get it for me for fear of what they would do with it if given the opportunity. Laughably, they still asked if I wanted to schedule and alterations appointment...FAT CHANCE!\n",
      "I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS!!!! I wish my two bridesmaids who went here would have done their research because this has been a nightmare!!!! First off the dresses were ordered nearly 9 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago my bridesmaids were told the dresses were \"lost\" they kept blaming Alfred Angelo even though Alfred Angelo said the dresses were already shipped. So for 3 weeks after going back and forth with the dumb manager and whoever else works there my fiance had to take over and forced the owner to give him the UPS tracking number... after looking at the activity with the tracking number it turns out the dresses were NOT lost but had been attempted to be delivered 3 different times but every time they tried to deliver them the store did not have the payment for the delivery even though the dresses were paid in full already!! I am so angry and so confused as to how a company can function and stay open like this! They are so unhelpful and rude! Supposedly tonight the manager is going to the UPS hub to pick up the dresses so my bridesmaids can pick them up tomorrow.. with my wedding less than 3 weeks away I sure hope this is true! I will believe it when I see it. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but according to this link, this shitty store has officially closed its doors, moved out, and disconnected their phones: http://linktown.azfamily.com/biz/once-in-a-lifetime-bridal/tempe/az/85284/296516 Unbelievable. In addition to the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life, they have now also stolen money from my bridesmaids, who paid for their dresses and never received them. I feel so awful for my best friends, as well as all the other brides and bridesmaids that will not receive their dresses and have been hustled by this fraudelent and thieving store. Once in a Life Tyme Bridal, you suck at life and should all go back to the white trash hole you crawled out of.\n",
      "A one-star rating for this business is generous. The staff are rude, flippant, immature, and obnoxious. The manager is never in the store, but you will be placed on hold for 30 minutes and speak to 3 different people before you are informed of this. Don't bother requesting that the manager be called, too, because she flat out refuses to speak to her customers. No assistance is provided in the dressing rooms, no organization is evident behind the counter (beware your credit card receipts!), and no dress ever arrives in a timely manner. Repeating other reviewers' concerns, that this business is still up and running is shameful.\n",
      "Really glad Yelp is smart enough to filter out the 5 star reviews. If you notice, the exact same people, with the exact same 5 star reviews posted them EVERYWHERE they possibly could. This place is quite possibly the biggest joke of a business I have ever encountered. My best friend \"bought\" her dress there. I'm not going to bother typing out how horrid our experience was, but I will say it was RIGHT ON PAR with what everyone else has written. Do yourself a favor, just don't do it. Ever.\n",
      "This place doesn't need another bad review but I am giving them one because it's worth it to me to write this all out. I am an MOH to my best friend and we just had the WORST afternoon with these people, essentially the most horrific bridal situation. My best friend (the bride) bought her gown at the Phoenix Bridal Convention back in January through this bridal shop. The sales people were pushy the day of the convention but my friend loved her dress so much, and the price was right, so we over-looked it. The bride's mom put down half of the $$ for the dress, and they charged her credit card the wrong amount. They were supposed to call the bride when the dress came in the first week of May, and she didn't hear from them. She basically had to call every week to finally get an answer that the dress was in the shop, and to schedule her first alterations session with their seamstress. We show up this afternoon, the bride came in from Flagstaf, the MOB came in from Colorado for this fitting. We get there and first they cannot find her dress, of course we are panicking right away. Then they find the dress, and for some reason mixed up her appointment and thought it was at 4pm rather than 1pm, so the seamstress was not in the shop and wasn't available in the afternoon to come in. This place contracts out seamstresses, they do not have an in-house seamstress - and this was NOT made clear to the bride when she made the alterations appointment. When we asked if they could call in another seamstress, they couldn't find their contacts and didn't even understand when we asked \"how does your seamstress contracting work\" - they had no answer because they didn't even understand what that meant. Finally we decide we are going to take the dress elsewhere to get altered because the bride at this point doesn't trust this place, and wanted to get out ASAP. She got a free veil and tiara at the convention when she bought her dress, so we needed to get those items from the store and then we were going to leave. It took them an HOUR to figure out what veil and tiara she had pre-ordered, people would say they were helping us, then walk away. Essentially the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We walked out with the bride in tears, the mother extremely angry, but at least we had the dress and no longer need to deal with these people. Long story short - DO NOT order your bridal items from this store, they are disorganized, it was disgustingly dirty in the shop, and they will rip you off without even knowing it.\n",
      "I am a regular at Antalya Red Square, for lunch that is. The food is really good, the interior being a curious blend of Turkish chintz with a Russian after taste. One of my Russian coworkers identified it as Azerbaijani, a former soviet republic and part of the Ottoman Empire before that. Anyhow, I digress. You might have better luck eating lunch there on a weekday than dinner. The server is really nice and hard working (read, overworked). My favorite is their falafel sandwich, chicken Shawarma or even the Lamb Kofte sandwich. As of May 2008 the lunch special cost 7 dollars including the lentil soup, not a bad deal. The sandwich is hard to finish after the soup and hot pita but it keeps you full until dinner. The falafel is crunchy and wholesome, nestled in a bed lettuce, onions and tomatoes that benefit from the creamy dollop of hummus. Closed on Mondays.\n",
      "Always fun for a great Russian party with lots of food and dancing! One of the good ones!\n",
      "This Russian/ Turkish/ restaurant/night club or whatever it was is a disaster! It is a shame because the food is really good. The servers were HORRIBLE and it turned out to be a very disappointing evening for my family. We were never even offered drinks the entire evening! We had to beg for water and menus. The appetizers eventually made their way out of the kitchen after the meals arrived. Our server quit half way during our dinner! The owners really need to figure out the restaurant's identity and get their act together if they want to make it. I feel bad about writing this review because the chef (former chef of Ceder Center Anatola) is excellent. :(\n",
      "We discovered this restaurant by accident for dinner (used to be a korean restaurant location). When we walked in, there weren't a lot of people there but i'm glad we stayed. The food is delicious and definitely high quality. We ordered the dinner for two--small mixed appetizer, kabab mixed platter and two kinds of dessert--and it was very good. The hummus is some of the best i've tasted and is served with a warm pita basket, that will be refilled upon request to the waiter. Every time we've come back the food has been spot-on. What i feel that's lacking though is the atmosphere. There's no one to greet you at the front when you walk in so it feels like you're intruding on a private party, the decor is sparse and not at all cozy. I would definitely come back but the restaurant owners could make it more welcoming.\n",
      "Went there at 5:30 on a Wednesday to find the place locked up, despite the website hours saying it would be open. No signs or anything to indicate why it was closed, and phone calls went to voicemail, very disappointed\n",
      "I was on holiday with my boyfriend. We were at Edinburgh for a couple of days doing tours. We stumbled upon this place, what a happy surprise! First time we came, the place was packed. The server told us it would be about 10 or 15 minutes, she was closing a ticket and they should be leaving soon. No problem. She recommended that we go two doors down at Castle Arms for a drink and we thought why not. We returned and the table was ready for us. Now the food. My boyfriend had the haggis for appetizer and supper. I had oyster for starter and fish for supper. I tried the haggis for the first time. It was creamy and good. Delish! We ordered a bottle of wine and shared a pudding for desert. The owner came by our table to serve us the food. Server says he's a hard worker. I can tell he takes pride in his restaurant. We were happy with the first visit, we came returned the next day! The only con i could think of is the toilet. There is only 1 ladies room, and on the second night, someone took their time. If I'm ever in Edinburg again, I will definitely come back for another haggis.\n",
      "Bland overcooked overpriced.. The overall 3 rating is too generous. I should have checked first before I wandered into this dump.\n",
      "This was a sad experience. The entry is nicely painted staircase with lively graffitti. The inside looks cozy with exposed brick walls and wine bottles with dripping candles to add to the ambiance. We asked to eat on the terrace. That was probably our mistake. The waitress didn't came back after we said we needed a minute. The guy waiting on us seemed to be the chef. The food took a while to come out and then was bland and cold. It was pretty though. Just wish it tasted as good as it looked.\n",
      "I went to Maxies Bistro - with so many options, I went there because of their cleverly placed sign at the bottom of the steps on Victoria St which lured me upwards. It was open late one night in Edinburgh. It was too cold to eat in the Terrace but at the time the Terrace looked too lonely to be eating out from. I sat at a cushy table near the bar - that part of the restaurant makes me think of Persia in its glory, but the food is quite decidedly Scottish. I had the Tower of Haggis - an arrangement of Haggis, Neeps and Tatties fancifully arranged as a tower. It was quiet at the time - just me and the bartender so I sat back and relaxed and paired it with some mulled wine and finished with a great Berry Crumble dessert. Good value. Hurray for free wi-fi access as well!\n",
      "Horrendous. Truly wolf dressed as lamb. The decor and layout were deceptively nice, but please do not waste your bills on this place. Our waiter was surly and only attempted a pleasantry when bringing the bill. The food was standard if not completely appalling (some had a brown salad, others had meh 15 pound lamb, and I had bland mushroom pasta that left me in the bathroom for a good part of the night). Plenty of other places in this fair city.\n",
      "Worst steak of my life!!!! Tasted like it was made 2 weeks ago then microwaved a week ago then boiled in bath water today. Cold as hell. Garlic Sauce tasted like watered shit. Never again. The garlic bread was microwaved too! The nice waitress earned their one star for refunding my money\n",
      "Stopped in here with a group of fellow traveler's for the prix fixe lunch before heading up the road to the castle. The choices were actually pretty good, I ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer, salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert. The garlic cheesebread was not what I expected. It was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese. It was more like eating toasted bread. I couldn't find a hint of garlic in it, and I was expecting mozzarella cheese and this Italian sounding appetizer. It wasn't bad, but not what I expected. I was thinking more along the lines of an Italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich. The entree was very well done. Both the chicken and salmon were superb. The sauce on the entree was also quite nice. The vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless. The dessert was also very good, and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song I'd never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday. I'm only giving this 3 stars though for the price. I don't think it was a very good value. At 22 pounds without beverage (almost USD$40) I feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn't quite command that sort of price. It was included in my trip package so I wasn't out anything out of pocket really, but I couldn't recommend it to someone else unless it were a bit cheaper. Nice little place though. Service was very good and the food came out quickly. Maybe other dishes would be better and priced more appropriately.\n",
      "Over all the visits I had here (about once a year since 2010) I think that 2 star is about as much as it deserves. That is NOT for the food, nor for the ambiance - both are seriously lacking in class, depth and flavour. The first few visits we tried some food (notice that I didn't use the phrase \"we had a meal\") Nope, my 2 stars go to A. Location. They are a in brilliant out of the way suntrap in the summer. Sit outside and enjoy the scenery. Definitely worth a star B. Service. (not the cooking!) Their front of house are really nice and the amount of unhappy customers must really wear them down. I actually feel sorry for them. This, my friends, is what you show visitors so they know what to avoid for the rest of their stay. It is a tourist trap. I certainly hope to see a 'New Kitchen Manager' banner here rather sooner than later. That may entice me to visit again. Maybe. Though I am a possibly a sucker to go here once a year in the summer to see any kind of change has been made.. only to be disappointed. Maybe next time\n",
      "Maxies doesn't look much from the outside, and to be honest, it isn't up to all that much inside either. Situated just round the corner from the Royal Mile, Maxies is right behind Edinburgh Castle and so it ought to be a great restaurant for all the tourists to go, but unfortunately it is not up to much. The restaurant has quite a cosy feel inside with padded seats covered in cushions, with a pretty lively atmosphere. The menu in Maxies is pretty much seafood orientated, with lots of fish and seafood dishes, but there are also steaks, stir fry's, chicken and haggis dishes on the menu too. I had the sole cooked in a creamy sauce, which was OK. The sauce was pretty thick and gloopy and lacked proper taste, but the fish was perfectly cooked. My friend had a pasta dish which they really didn't like, she said the pasta was still hard and that the sauce was tepid - not nice. The service was pretty average too, the waiter's weren't that attentive and only seemed to show some life when we asked for the bill. There are much better restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of the custom than Maxies.\n",
      "Let me first say, we were wearied, hungry and circled the town several times before stopping here. It was late and most Edinburgh restaurants stop serving dinner at 10 PM. We snuck in because it was close to our fantastic hotel - Missoni. So the food was no great shakes but not as horrible as other reviewers write. I had poached salmon with boiled veggies and man had spicy chicken something. Both good and not overpowering for a late night meal. We had a bottle of the Maxie's house red. Good for the price. The interior was small ans quaint; a little stone-walled, candle-lit room with a medieval charm. Nice terrace, too. What really stood out was the service. Sweet little cherubs served us with smiles and willingly provided tips for fun stuff to do during our stay. We hung quite awhile and relaxed, chatting with the staff and other guests. I would recommend for late-night meals after a long day of travel or sunny terrace pint stops. We're told it rains more than not in Edinburgh so give it a shot on a sunny day. Staff easily gets 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3. Last note - one of the sweet cherubs tried to tell us we gave too much money, to which we replied, nope we thoroughly enjoyed it. Cheers!\n",
      "Initially very impressed by the place, but then turned into an average experience in the end. You come down into a lovely cave like place with nice moody lighting. The food was pretty good but the service not particularly friendly and the place was too cold so I had my jacket on the whole time. Certainly cannot fault the speed of the arrival of food.....probably arriving worryingly fast for what we had. Hoping it wasn't microwaved! All in all, an okay place but absolutely nothing to shout about unfortunately.\n",
      "I came for the sun, I stayed for some food and both were really rather nice. Had it not been a super, super sunny and hot day, and had I not been looking for an outdoor place to eat, drink and soak up the rays (I shall defeat rickets yet!) I may not have come to Maxie's. But with it's prime location on Johnstone Terrace, overlooking Victoria Street and the Grassmarket, it got ALL the sunshine and did some quite nice pub grub to boot. This is old fashioned British pub grub. Not nouveau gasto-pub posh burgers with portobello mushrooms and haloumi. It's the sort of pub grub I ate as wee girl at our local smiddy pub. Which is good in it's own right. So, of course, I had breaded mushrooms and duck liver pate. And they were fine. Nice even. The chicken enchillada on the left of me looked really quite good, lots of chicken, fresh ingredients and not too cheesy. But pub grub food is as pub grub food does. No bells and whistles, but still good quality for what it is. The next time the suns out I'd happily bob down here for another drink and bite to eat. Scottish tan (roughly lobster red) comes as standard.\n",
      "Un tres bel endroit, tant par sa situation que par son décor ! Les plats écossais typiques sont servis à la francaise, petits légumes pomme de terre, carte des vins et beaux desserts ! Si vous etes dans les parages, un peu blasé de la friture des pubs, mais que vous voulez manger à thème scottish, c'est un super compromis!\n",
      "The best thing about this place is probably how it looks... which is never a great thing to write about a restaurant/pub/bistro - I'm not really sure which one this place is supposed to be. It was too pricey to be classed as a gastro-pub sort of place, but the food wasn't really restaurant standard, nor was the service. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but the what you pay and what you get don't quite tally up somehow, especially when you've got such amazing places earby like the Grain Store or Maison Bleue. It's just above Victoria Street, in the side of the hill stretching up to the castle, so if you get a table on it's little outdoor terrace in the sun then you may as well just write off any constructive plans you may have had for the rest of the day, because I can safely say you'll be sipping something cold for the rest of the afternoon.\n",
      "A little out of the way, tucked away on a side street in Edinburgh, it truly was a neat little places. Inside, it was a lot like a cave, with plush little seats resplindent with pillows and tables with candles. The food was heavy on the carbohydrates, lots of pasta and rice, but the food was damned well tasty too. We had pasta with red sauce, and I had the stir fry the flavours were full bodies and well developed. Service was a touch slow, but over all, I'd come back.\n",
      "i hate to give them a bad review because our waiter was so nice....but, my allegiance to the YELP community must persevere! This was a crappy restaurant. But, it was walking distance from our apartment and my mother-in-law wanted something close. Arghhhh. The drinks were warm (yes, I know I'm in Scotland....but, I'm from the US where we serve cold drinks) and the food was mediocre. Had the shrimp stir fry and it was pretty bland. The only good thing was the price and the nice waiter. Don't waste your money. I lost my pounds so you don't have to.\n",
      "Came here with my family during my wedding weekend. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating seeing as every other restaurant nearby was extremely busy and had no room for our large party. I ordered a chicken entree which was extremely tasty. The rest of my family all ordered various items off the menu and everyone agreed that our food was good. Good food and great service is all I need when I visit a restaurant and this place delivered.\n",
      "Dinner, and it was fantastic food. We had starters and mains, and we were not disappointed. The mussels were some of the best ones I have ever eaten. The salmon came next, and it was cooked to perfection. My company ate salad, fajitas and chicken, and we were all very pleased and happy. The interior is picturesque and warmingly welcome. The staff would be difficult to get a hold of, as they frequently rushed by or looked in the other direction, and the toilets were small and not so nice. But the food will make me go back there again and again.\n",
      "I used to love this place a few years back so when Ms Susie suggested it for a quick bite to eat last night, I was excited to go back. It was really quiet compared to its neighbours but we didn't let that put us off. Maybe it should've been a warning. Susie had the chicken enchilada & I opted for the tower of haggis, neeps & tatties, a real winter warmer. The plates arrived & the portions were generous. Well the haggis & tatties were, the neeps were almost non-existent. The tatties looked as though they had been toasted under the grill but in fact the dish must've been keep warm in the oven as both the tatties & haggis were dried out. I tried to eat some from the middle but it just wasn't doing it for me. I cannot fault the service. As soon as I told the waitress she offered me something else from the menu. By then I'd lost my appetite so they took it off the bill. Shortly after the chap at the next table also complained. He though his breaded mushrooms were going to break his teeth!! Susie's enchilada was definitely the better choice. Overall I would've given 2 stars but for the decent service which gets it three stars. I may go back but when there's a wealth of competition it's better be good next time.\n",
      "Excellent with outdoor seating. Had the haggis appetizer and fish and chips! Great food, great view, great service.\n",
      "Décor atypique et haut en couleur. Des viandes très bien cuites et très tendres mais des portions un peu juste.\n",
      "We had just come from a horribly serviced restaurant and when we came to Maxie's everything was a lot better. Our server was a young man and despite having a lot to do (practically serving everyone) he was super helpful and nice and always had a smile on his face. Very pleased with the food as well it was all very good and had many selections to choose from. The only negative I think is the set up, it was so crowded up there the restaurants were split up outside and it was weird, but it's easy to get around that and is very much worth it.\n",
      "We stopped in for a snack and to warm up on a rainy November day in early afternoon and had a very pleasant experience sitting in the small lounge bar area. Only a few other people were there, the hot, mulled wine hit the spot and the other snacks were tasty.\n",
      "We saw the sign that mentions they have good fish and chips cooked to order so we thought why not try some classic uk fish and chips like we hear about on television. The batter was not salted or seasoned so there was zero flavour, the fish they used had no flavour to speak of. The temp on the fryer must have been too low because the batter was very greasy and it soaked right through into the fish as well. Maybe they are famous for something else but they have no business selling fish and chips\n",
      "Excellent location with good food and excellent service. We got into this place after walking around Edinburgh, site-seeing and shopping. I passed by this little place the day before and I decided to come back and try it out. It's a cozy little place, warm and comfortable. We were greeted from the door and seated immediately. We started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce. Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce. Veggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant. I am not sure if she was the manager or not. But she was quite polite and helpful. I would love to come here in summer and dine out on the patio, it has such a nice and unique view...\n",
      "Good location, nice decor, nice staff, terrible food. I ate here recently and was decidedly disappointed; from the menu it looked as though the food would be lovely. I had smoked salmon and cream cheese pate which was much more cheese than pate, then a very interesting take on enchiladas which unfortunately was the kind of standard I'd expect in McDonalds. My boyfriend had duck and orange pate which was horrible; he only ate half of it. He then had steak, which he said was nice but the crevettes it came with were mushy and very over-cooked, and the mashed potato with was dry and crumbly - he said it reminded him of the sort of potato you'd get at school. He thought it'd had all been left under a heat lamp as it was so dry. We were discussing how it had been so busy and the only conclusion that we came to was that it's in a tourist trap. I don't think this place gets a lot of repeat business. My advice if you're looking for somewhere nice for dinner in this area is to go to Maison Bleue on Victoria St, or The Outsider on George IV Bridge.\n",
      "I like In and out burger. The prices are reasonable. the menu is simple. The burger is good. But I do have a problem with the massive lines and the seating. I assume that this is the way In and out burger is but I do not like to wait for a burger then have to scan the room for a dirty table that I have to wipe down myself.\n",
      "Showed up here at 12:57 AM a few nights ago -- we were driving from Tucson to Los Angeles, and pulled off on a whim, hoping this location had hours to 1:30 or 2 AM. The place looked open, but empty -- we pulled into the drive through, asked if they were still open, and received a very enthusiastic \"For three more minutes!\" I felt bad about it, but the cashier was nice, and the fellow who handed us our burgers jokingly said that they were made with love. It seems odd to say it, but he sounded genuinely sincere. Ordered two cheeseburgers with extra everything, a double-double, and two fries. Fries were piping hot / crispy, single burgers were heavily laden with at least 2.5 times the normal veggies -- unusually large for 'extra everything.' I wouldn't normally leave a review for an In N Out, but everyone we spoke to was very nice, and they served us so close to closing. Thank you!\n",
      "It had been a while since I had been to an In N Out, and I figured I would give it another chance. I've lived in California twice, and everyone there is obsessed with the place. I can remember my first time visiting and thinking, meh, it's just ok. So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food. My opinion: meh. Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special. Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week. So next time I was hungry, that's exactly what I did....go across I10 and get something that I enjoy.\n",
      "Best place to get a protein burger and vanilla shake. The staff is always friendly but today our cashier Madison went above and beyond when my son was being cranky while I was trying to order. She gave him stickers and a hat. Thanks for helping to calm him down.\n",
      "I've been to this place several times and the service is always friendly and fast. Orders were always correct. Prices are very reasonable. Only con is the limited menu, but hey, that's how they work so fast.\n",
      "Fries sucked but that's okay cus in and out has the best burgers. Literally better than any other burger I've ever had. Service is great like chick filas too.\n",
      "No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out \"In and Out Man I love that place\" I think that says it all.\n",
      "Best low-carb burger in town.... Double Double with cheese protein style (wrapped in lettuce).\n",
      "Absolutely one of the best fast food restaurants ever!!! Never had a bad meal here and always friendly staff. Be sure to look of the secret codes to order as they will make much more than what is on there general menu. Recommend the Double-Double with animal style fries and a drink. I hope one day they put one in Seattle, WA.\n",
      "I love their burgers! It's my favorite place to go after a long day of work. The spread is amazing over the fries because sometimes they can be plain. The burgers are nice and juicy. The meals are cheaper the most fast food places and you get more for your money. I have been satisfied with my service they took my order quickly and kept the line moving.\n",
      "yes 2 stars. Fries were cold and hard, and burger seemed EHH. I dont have these where I live so I was excited to get one. They did give my dog a patty which I thought was cool. BUT the fries killed it for me and the burger just seemed off.\n",
      "We stopped here on our way out of town for a trip. They were busy but we were helped fairly quickly. We got our food and were able to get a seat no problem. The food was great as always. The staff was very friendly and they had people walking around checking on tables and clearing trays. We will definitely be back when we are in the area.\n",
      "This location is always busy, but it is worth the wait. The burgers are amazing (we all already know this), and the staff are always friendly, welcoming and work very hard. They also are able to manage a long line in the drive thru very efficiently, you'll be surprised how quickly you can move through.\n",
      "It seems every time I head west for either golf or coming back from LA, I like to stop off and grab a number 1. The burger always has fresh produce and the fries are one of the best.\n",
      "Check your order before you dive away or you'll get a bag of fries and a bag of fries. No burgers. Serious?!\n",
      "First off I love in-n-out for life lol, I've been going ever since I was a kid, however it was the California location, which for some reason always has that authentic taste but ever since moving out here, I've gone to this one every time because it tastes just as good!! But every time I go they always seem to forget something on my order..\n",
      "A #1 Double Double w/ Animal Style fries... Simply the Best!!\n",
      "If In-N-Out is available to us, we're goin' to it! This location treated us as well as previous ones we have been to! We headed straight there after getting settled at the hotel. Manged to score a table outside in the shade and enjoyed our burgers and Animal Fries in peace!\n",
      "I've only gone through the drive through BUT they never mess it up! Always yummy! Of course it can get busy because 1. it's in n out & 2. it's right off of the 10!\n",
      "Black shoe leather. Worst burger ever. Don't use the drive up as they will dump their rejects on you.\n",
      "On a recent visit to the Phoenix area, we Seattleites decided to indulge in a trip to In-N-Out, something that we don't have up here. We are so glad we ate here. The place was PACKED on a weekday afternoon and for good reason! Everything we ordered was incredible (burgers, fries, milkshake). Yum! Can't wait to go back! I deducted a star because we had nowhere to sit and the food took a long time. Wish we had In-N-Out in Seattle.\n",
      "Perfect, just like everyother in-n-out\n",
      "It's a clean, friendly, yummy place for the famous In N Out taste. Don't forget the hidden menu- get it animal style.\n",
      "While this wasn't my first In-n-Out experience, it was my first in a over a decade and I have to say, I remember it a lot better than it actually is. OK, don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me. It was fresh, well made and just fine. I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to! I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion, they mean it!), fries and a chocolate shake. I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce, which to me is just thousand island), liked the fries, although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste). The place was packed, the service was fine and the price was right! I would go go back, but I like Five Guys better - sorry I do!!\n",
      "My go to location. Great fast and friendly spirit. Employees really seem like they enjoy working here. Food is consistently fresh and tasty.\n",
      "Always a great burger and love their fries. This location does get crazy busy at times though and we've left because it was too busy. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "Where to start. Ugh. Spent $30 to feed my family. Asked for no tomatoes and they put two big fat hearty slices. Nasty. Pulled them out for of course it left that nasty seeded snail trail. Yuck but I can deal. Then my son. Eating his 4x4 and get to almost the last bite and finds a bug in it. It looked like possibly a large mosquito. Not sure. It was some large winged thing. I took it in and pointed it out to the lady at the register and she thoroughly examined it like I was a liar trying to get out of it or something. They replaced it about 15 minutes later. Just an overall bad experience. This is a very fast paced in n out so I try to look past the dirty tables and full trash. But bugs? Can't let that slide.\n",
      "SLOW service. I've been to other In-N-Outs before, and while I'm not the biggest fan of their food, they at least get it out in a timely manner. This location doesn't seem to do the same.\n",
      "this is the third time I've ordered drive thru from this location asking specifically for a double double hamburger and they have given me a cheeseburger. most definitely my last straw\n",
      "Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger. The fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips. The restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt. This was worth trying once.\n",
      "I'd say this place is just a normal In-N-Out Business. You get the same treatment, the long lines, similar food quality and burgers, and the overall satisfaction of getting something in your belly after a long drive. My friends and I stopped by this place on our way from Tucson, AZ to Los Angeles, CA and she was craving \"animal style\" fries so we had to stop by here. If you do decide to make a pit stop at this place, I'll warn you now about the parking. The flow of traffic in and out from this restaurant business is awful. Lines build up and just finding parking in their small lot is a nightmare. We came around peak hours, unfortunately, and luckily found a spot in the corner to walk inside and order. I believe we got there around 12:30pm or 1:00pm and I never wanted to get out of an In-N-Out so badly until then. Haha. But I digress. If you want a standard burger and fries that'll curb your appetite, this place is always the place to go to. It's conveniently located next to other shops and stores (like Taco Bell and Walmart), and is just off the freeway. How convenient!\n",
      "After a year I made it back to Phoenix. The food here was better than the last time I visited. The fries were really good as well was the chocolate milkshake. It's a great place to eat for fast food.\n",
      "This must be my 43rd different location of in-n-out, so I consider myself an aficionado. I got double the salt on my double double. But seriously folks, I will not be doubling back to this location. In and staying Out!\n",
      "Does one need to even write a review for In-N-Out? The value can't be beat- the burgers are delicious (especially Animal Style), the fries are so light I have to stop from inhaling them, and the shakes are the perfect consistency and size. My only complaint is that they are not in Chicago!\n",
      "In-N-Out is standard. We went at lunch time and it was crowded (which is typical for all In-N-Outs). I was a bit suprised that my food was out right after I ordered (accidentally almost grabbed someone else's; they called 74 and I thought I heard 94). Anyways, the maximum capacity for the dining area is 71 people, so if your planning on having a party, bring under 71 otherwise your 72nd friend will have to sit outside (and no one likes to sit by themselves). Pro's: 1. This In-N-Out is in a really good location. Right off the freeway; you can go off the freeway, grab your food, and go back on. Con's: 1. Good luck finding a seat.\n",
      "The food is very good but they never have enough help at this location. The lines are always too long and the staff is often not aware of the need to speak up and clean up. Typical In and Out food.\n",
      "I don't even eat red meat and I have to give it 5 stars! Love their grilled cheese with onions, fries, and either a strawberry shake or iced tea. Low prices, fresh food, and friendly employees. My favorite fast food place! Parking lot can be a bit challenging and always crowded. There is another location at the 101 and Camelback that isn't too far away, but not nearly as crowded.\n",
      "I came here expecting the best burger ever.. hailing from Chicago, that would be a tall task, being that we have so many great burger joints. Maybe it was too much hype.. maybe I expected a high end burger.. I came away with a very good impression nonetheless. The burger was very good, fresh, great bun to meat ratio, good toppings and great value. The fries were alright, kinda soggy and a bit underwhelming, even with animal style toppings. 4 stars.. great fast food burger, one of the best chain burgers I have had. I realized quickly this was not a high end joint but the quality was definitely comparable. Service was fast for the amount of traffic in and out this place.\n",
      "Great and fast service. I really like their Neapolitan shake.\n",
      "It's a good burger and milkshake-great for the price. I am not a big fan of their fries, but I know a lot of people who are. The hidden menu is fun to try out as well! This place is always busy, but they have a good staff that speeds up the line quickly.\n",
      "I love In-N-Out you always know what you are going to get. But at this location they have one gal taking the orders that does not know what animal style is. She gave me just a cheese burger last time and today we went here and she almost messed it up again.\n",
      "Classic chain food place. So I will review on the service because the food is just like most others. I am greeted with a smile and like the people there. but it should be a little cleaner I think.\n",
      "Long line in the drive thru (weekend) but worth the wait! I ordered through an employee standing in the drive thru, with a tablet in hand. Very friendly, very professional! Quality of food and service is outstanding!!!\n",
      "I will give 5 stars if their french fries taste better than fried cardboard. Their burgers are good with fresh lettuce and tomato, better than Burger King, McDonalds and Jack in a box. I sent my comment about french fries but I suppose they are not gonna make better fries. I wish they would use russet or yukon gold.\n",
      "My brother is visiting from Seattle, where apparently they do not have In 'n' Out Burgers! So of course we had to go. The menu could not be simpler, and for once, a fast-food burger looks like what's advertised. Will definitely go again when I'm craving a burger and fries.\n",
      "We've been coming here for years. I've always loved In-N-Out ... the burgers are on the small end but it's perfect for me. Great service. Great food. Super busy location.\n",
      "I have been to In-N-Outs in Cali and in AZ. My niece from OH was craving it, so we all jump into the car and went. I ordered the #2 (cheeseburger, fries, and a drink). They still do not impress me, the cheeseburger was ok. I love the fries but they have to be eaten fresh. They taste soggy if you wait too long. Smash Burger is still my love, sorry In-N-Out.\n",
      "This place is super overrated. I wasn't sure if I was eating a burger or a jar of salt\n",
      "Another trip to in n out and it was as good as usual. Boyfriend said his burger was kinda dry but mine was just fine.\n",
      "Yum yum gimme some!! This place is always busy... and that's cause it's delicious!! Staff is sweet and friendly and burgers never disappoint.\n",
      "in the immortal words of the Bangles: If you want to find all the cops, They're hanging out in the In-N-Out. They sing and dance (Oh-Way-Oh) They spin their clock and cruise on down the block at least I think that is how it goes now =P Seriously they had about 4-5 squad cars here when I swung through late at night with a friend to get something on the way back to SURPRISE where we were staying. It is awesome that they are always open late. Pro Tip: Do not try and rob this location. You are likely to find more cops than in a doughnut shop grubben or chillaxen here! The grub was pretty tasty. Exactly what you would expect from In-N-Out. The double double was tasty. I stole some fries from my friend since I didnt wanna eat a lot of them. Carb overload on the fries ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... i can feel the fat growing even now from the carbs... This place is tasty and worth a stop. Its everything you could want in a quick burger and is the only \"fast food\" joint just about that I will eat at on rare occasion. Enjoy it, it is tasty.\n",
      "In-n-Out. If you don't know about it, get your head out of your a** and get a double double, animal style with fries and a shake. You're welcome.\n",
      "I've been a consistent costumer of In N Out throughout the years. They make the best hamburgers EVER. Seriously, I feel like angels are dancing on my tongue after ever bite. I'm almost positive I saw a unicorn poop out a rainbow last time I was here. The food is always delicious, hot and fresh. This location was no different. Only downside to my last visit is that some rando crazy man walked in talking to himself and hung out in the corner for awhile having a very important and loud conversation with himself. I wasn't really fazed. I mean shit it's 105 outside, that'll make the best of us go a little crazy. Now get up and go get yourself a damn double double and don't forget to animal style that ish.\n",
      "Worth the wait - love this place - lucky if i get it every 5-10 years. You can't go wrong with in-n-out. Menu isnt big so just het a burger and fries. I suggest the burger \"animal style\" and pink lemonade if you are't getting a milkshake.\n",
      "Went on a Saturday evening, the place was really packed but the service was super fast and the food was great. We enjoyed our meal :)\n",
      "Fast service, good burgers, same as any other in-n-out. The know how to handle lunch time with out making people wait too long.\n",
      "I've never been to an In-N-Out, I've only seen instagram pics and etc so since I was starving and wanted some fries and decided to expand my beef taste buds (I don't eat beef,but when I do it's only Taco Bell and Five guys) so I went through the drive through since inside was packed. I got my meal and sat in my car and ate thinking with such amazing great reviews I'd have the same experience, but no. When I got my food it smelled like fish, the fries were okay, not what I was expecting and the burger was okay. The only good thing about the food was you can taste how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes. Also the girl at the drive through was nice, that's about as all the good things I can say. I'm so disappointed, I was really wanting an awesome meal since I didn't feel like driving to a restaurant in old Scottsdale and waiting for my food and being even more hungry. Either way I will not eat In-N-Out ever again, just not my cup of tea lol. I only give two stars to places I will never eat again.\n",
      "I love In-N-Out!!! This location is awesome. The staff is extremely friendly. It can get busy, so I would recommend going durning the off times.\n",
      "Ok food and great service. The owners, family and staff really make the difference. Duncan is a great host and a pleasure to talk to. Small but comfortable atmosphere. Gate 403 brings in wonderful jazz talent and they promote young talent. Keep up the great job!\n",
      "A very talented and musical friend of mine was playing a jazzy show here and I rarely if ever pass up an invite to hear live music. Almost every day of the week at Gate 403 you'll be sure to happen upon a few local jazz artists or bands who are simply playing their music for the love of it. Not only do I find this endearing, I also think it's perfect for those who wish to support local talent in Toronto. While Gate 403 is not a large space, it fits a nice crowd of people who are either there for the food or for the music. Both are safe bets if you ask me. Gate 403 is a mix between a pub and a piano bar and it seems to have something for everyone. Come in for the food and stay for the tunes, either way you'll be happy you filled your ears and of course, your belly.\n",
      "Let me be clear, you come here for the music and vibe--not the food or service. Casual drinks or a date its a great spot. However, if you are planning on having dinner this is not the place. Very few waitstaff so the service is slow, even when they are around they are not attentive. Who brings over two waters for a table of four? food is typical bar fare and it is mediocre at best. If this place didnt have live music I really couldnt see a reason to come here unless i was desperate for a pint.\n",
      "Very cool bar with great live jazz music, the servers r nice & nice selection of beer on tap\n",
      "Awesome place!! I used to basically live here Tuesday nights for Julian Fauth! I held a business christmas party here and was taken care of BIG TIME!!! love the owner, barmaids and everything about this place... Calamari?? meh....its better for booze and tunes...\n",
      "Came with a group of friends on Thursday night (they had a bar rail cocktail special for $4)! You can't go wrong with $4 drinks and great company. Ordered the signature burger with fries, fish tacos, calamari and bruschetta. Overall, the food and service was awesome! The burger is definitely a must try, especially with their fresh cut fries. Yummm\n",
      "Love the food here and the service is great. I attend the Saturday Afternoon (5-8) Blues and roots sessions quite often. Always find a few faces I know in the crowd.\n",
      "I am super surprised to be one of the very few 2 star reviews for this place... As a place to grab drinks and listen to live music, I'd be willing to give this place a 3 star but the food and atmosphere were not the best. I ordered the cheese Quesadillas (a commonly known safe bar food option in my opinion). It was very small for $9 price tag that came with it (three pieces) and every ingredient tasted like it came from a can (think pizza pocket!) My friends ordered the garlic bread with cheese and the wings and again both of them said they were surprised about how bland the taste was. My recommendation is eat before or after coming here and just come for the band....\n",
      "Food was mediocre at best, not to mention far too pricey. I had ordered the burger with a side of fries and a drink, but instead received a salad instead of fries. When inquiring about the mix up, I was told \"You happy? No? You eat salad\". After being ignored for the next 20 minutes and subsequently eating the salad I was served, I finally managed to convince the owner to give me my plate of fries. The service was excruciatingly slow, though the supposed \" jazz\" (a single piano) was okay. Overall I give this restaurant bar a rating of 2 stars, since I did eventually receive my fries.\n",
      "The Gate has good and bad points, but every experience I've had here has been positive. I gotta urge ya to sit at the bar; it's often a rewarding experience, had a great conversation every time. The music is often excellent, and it's really the reason you go, though the placement of the stage doesn't work well - it's too close to the bar, so it's hard to walk between the bar and the larger tables in the back. Frankly it gets inordinately loud, so beware. Beer prices are excellent (usually $2 below the Local across the street) and they know how to mix drinks - most of the time. The food is nothing to write home about, but I'm there for music, company, and drinks, so I don't mind.\n",
      "Very disappointed in this place. Food was incredibly bad and way too expensive for the quality we got. Definitely not going back again.\n",
      "We came here on a Sunday night for a live jazz performance and casual drinks. It wasn't too busy so there was plenty of seating. The jazz band was situated right in the middle of the restaurant so you could sit infront or behind the band. No cover to see the band but they pass around a tip jar. Service was friendly and quick. They have a good selection of beers on tap with pints ranging between $5-8, fancy coctails priced at $8.50 and house wine for $5/glass. Food menu has the basic pub food with a few entrees. I don't know if I would come specifically to have a meal but it's an option if we're looking for snacks like nachos, fries or wings.\n",
      "I've been stopping in here for an after work drink quite frequently of late. First of all: they have an actual happy hour from monday to thursday, with the added bonus of half price appetizers til 6. My regular bartender Jasmine is top notch, and I've always found the music to be pleasant but not overwhelming in terms of sound level. Recommended.\n",
      "A lovely evening out. I would suggest reservations... particularly since visibility to the live acts is limited. However it is a nice place to explore if you are in the area and enjoy jazz, blues and folk music. If you're down in the area, give me a heads up...I'd be happy to try and connect with you.\n",
      "While waiting for a table at Barque we came across Gate 403. Is the 403 in reference to Calgary? Perhaps the owners are from out West? There is live jazz nightly, though on this particular night (Friday night) they would only be on until 9PM. There is no cover to see the band, but there is a tip jar. The bar itself has a good selection of beers (both on tap and bottled) and a list of cocktails and wines. The music was pretty good. The crowd was mixed. You had couples, you had solo-ers, and music lovers alike. Can't comment on the food as I didn't have any.\n",
      "Laid-back non-pretentious atmosphere. The venue is a bit small for everyone to see the performers but the atmosphere is intimate and homey!\n",
      "This is a terrific restuarant with amazing music. Everyone who loves Jazz music should come here to try the music and the food which is beyond my expectation !\n",
      "Gate 403 Bar and Grill is a hidden gem in Roncesvalles that host live jazz and blues 7 nights a week. Performers include #Juno award winning artists such as Julian Fauth! Check out the calendar on their website to see the performance schedule, they're really good about updating it! 403 SIGNATURE BURGER 4.5/5 PENNE PESTO 4.5/5 BRUSCHETTA 4/5 CAJUN SHRIMP 2.5/5 (could be because I'm not crazy about shrimp) BBQ WINGS 3.5/5 (regular bar wings) I tried their burger (Ground rib eye, pancetta, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, arugula, tomatoes, aioli served on a multigrain bun) and fresh cut fries ($14). Whenever I have this combo, regardless of how good the burger is (and it was pretty darn good), I focus more on the fries than the burger, is that weird? Anyways, I like my fries with a thin layer of crispiness on the outside and meltingly mushy on the inside (and not the powdery type of mushy). When fries have thick layer of crisp on the outside, it reminds me of my highschool cafeteria fries, which is not my preference. Gate 403 hit the nail right on the head with their fries, I will go back just for them. Another solid entree is their penne pasta with red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes and baby kale in olive pesto sauce ($13). If you order this, do NOT forget to add the sausage (+$3), which is optional (but come on, it really isn't). I also quite enjoyed the Bruschetta with Feta cheese, vine tomatoes, roasted garlic & balsamic drizzle ($9). The bread was crispy and the topping was seasoned perfectly. It seemed to be a rather big portion of bruschetta though, it can definitely be shared. Gate 403 also serves cocktails, martinis, sangrias and mangrias (the male version of sangria)! If you're looking for parking, there is a greenP lot within walking distance nearby.\n",
      "Love this place in theory... but the music is SO loud that it makes it tough to enjoy a great conversation along with your martini and jazz... (BTW: I'm not even an old fart yet... I like my music loud and this place gets on my nerves). BUT, if you don't want to talk, it's great for live jazz.... The food is OK - nothing to brag about but not a problem.\n",
      "Oh dear. I went on a Friday evening in April, expecting to hear Jazz. What I heard was so far from it. The band was driving people out of the bar. No Jazz, unprofessional music. I have been several times before, and they occasionally have good bands that actually play Jazz, but mostly it's a big miss music wise. Service is good, food is okay but perhaps expensive for what it is. But the biggest let down is a Jazz bar booking non Jazz musicians. Toronto is not devoid of good Jazz musicians! I'd stay clear of this place until they get a real booker and some better music.\n",
      "Great live Jazz every Wednesday! Terrific atmosphere and very friendly people. Go for a drink and enjoy the live music.\n",
      "Year after year, still love this place just the same if not more. The food, music, and service have only gotten better. Coming here is so warm and welcoming, such a great vibe. Toronto is lucky to have a hidden gem like Gate 403 :)\n",
      "While I think that, overall, Gate 403 is a great bar, the above four stars is not for the bar as a whole, but for the bar on Tuesday Nights. While Gate 403 has a revolving selection of live jazz, for free, every night of the week, Tuesdays are especially great, as they are the night Julian Fauth plays. Tuesdays have been, for the last few years, a regular destination for myself and many others on and off the Roncesvalles strip, due mostly to the fact that Julian's style of blues (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZarpCUeykI, but this doesn't really do the live setting justice) is so great for either letting sink into the background as a wonderful setting for conversation and drinking, or for sitting quietly at the bar and attending to. Besides that the bar is notable mostly for great and friendly bartenders (except for Kate, who is really great and unfriendly), the fact that there is free music every night, and a good cast of nice regulars.\n",
      "Great that they have live jazz music. The curry coconut ratatouille was delicious and priced fair. They only had one server when I went but service was still very quick.\n",
      "Definitely wouldn't recommend the food here. Drinks are a fair price. Music isn't bad on weekends. Service started out amazing but by the end of the night we had to pay with another waitress as our original disappeared into the night. Overall - not terrible, but not amazing either.\n",
      "So far, this is the best place I have found to hear jazz on a Saturday night in Toronto. You can still hear your conversation or you can focus on the music. The drinks are great (as is the service). Plus, it is a short walk south from the subway. I'm eager to try the food--it looks good.\n",
      "Came here for dinner and jazz with my friends who live in the neighborhood. It was not one of their best nights but the company was great and the staff were very friendly. The food was decent though nothing to write home about. The live band did play a few lovely songs and I can see how if I were a local I would enjoy coming here on certain nights when I expect the music to be good and would enjoy just sitting back with my glass of wine.\n",
      "when i am in the area this is one of my favorite places to stop by and chat with friends, The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is good and if you are there on a friday or saturday night the music is intoxicating. Even though i have not lived in the area for a decade, i still return every chance i get.\n",
      "Gate 403 is the definition of your cozy local bar. Always has a great crowd and live music. Has a wonderful array of drinks with bartenders who are able to conjure up drinks with funny names on a whim. The fresh cut fries are my favorite. I would say this is one of the gems in Toronto if you are looking to hang out with friends over good drinks and food.\n",
      "This place is ok if you just want to chill and have a few drinks and listen to jazz. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going and be sure to be there on time and not a minute late because they will give away your table. The food is ok and the atmoshphere can be described as cozy if you like to sit at tables that are an inch apart.\n",
      "Ich liebe das Essen im Juleps. Die Burger und die Steaks sind wirklich köstlich. Der Barkeeper ist nett und kompetent, was bedeutet, dass man sich mit ihm gut über verschiedene Drinks unterhalten kann. Allerdings sind die Kellner, die Einem das Essen servieren, entweder genervt oder einfach lustlos. Das ist der einzige Kritikpunkt am Juleps. Für die Burger lohnt es sich allerdings über die Kellner hinwegzusehen.\n",
      "Gefällt mir gut. Die Location ist sehr schön, mitten im Dick Areal. Meiner Meinung nach gibt es aber in der Umgebung Restaurants und Bars, in denen die Qualität etwas besser ist.\n",
      "Für Leute die gerne guten Single Malt Whisky trinken ist die Auswahl der Hammer. Essen is absolut für den Preis in Ordnung. Immer wieder gerne\n",
      "Tolle Cocktails, gute Stimmung, nettes Local, nich hab mich da total wohl gefühlt!!!\n",
      "İch finde das die schlechten komentare nicht zutreffent Mir schmeckt es sehr und Der Service ist gut bin immer wieder gerne da\n",
      "Julep's New York Bar & Restaurant is the right place for all fans of classical American cuisine and cocktails. Every day during Happy Hours 17:00-20:00 all cocktails cost only 4.50 euro! Moreover, you should definitely try Soulfood-Tower (6 / 12 fingerfood portions cost 6.20 / 8.50 euro, respectively).\n",
      "Ich kann um ehrlich zu sein nicht Verstehen, wieso die Bewertung hier so im Keller ist - das Juleps ist ein nettes (amerikanisches) Restaurant im super schickem Postindustialem Design. Die Preis sind zwar nicht die günstigsten, aber dafür scheckt das Essen wirklich gut und auch die Cocktails sind einfallsreich und lecker!\n",
      "War gestern zum ersten mal im Juleps und muss sagen das ich nicht wirklich begeistert war. Obwohl relativ wenig los war (ca. 15 Gäste) hat alles sehr lange gedauert. Auch war die Bedienung nicht wirklich professionell (mehrmaliges Nachfragen nach einer Bestellung). Die Cocktails waren ok. Zum Essen kann ich nichts sagen da ich nichts zum Essen hatte.\n",
      "Besuch am Samstag Abend: - zentral in Esslingen gelegen; im DICK Freizeit- und Erlebniscenter - Terrasse, sowie innen zweistöckiges Restaurant (mit Galerie) - Location okay; ziemlich groß, daher nicht unbedingt gemütlich - rieseige Auswahl an Drinks (wir saßen direkt an der Bar; Bartender waren einigermaßen professionell); Speisen haben wir nicht probiert - Santiago Julep geschmacklich gut und optisch schön zubereitet (7.80 EUR): Minze, Grenadine, Limetten, Zitronensaft, Ananassaft, Lemon Hart FAZIT: Große Auswahl an Cocktails, Räumlichkeit könnte gemütlicher sein, aber für einen Drink in Esslingen absolut okay!\n",
      "Ambiente: Gemütliche Bar/Restaurant auf 2 Ebenen mit angenehm gedimmten Licht. Auch draußen sitzt man auf einer Terasse sehr gemütlich. Das einzige Manko sind die kleinen Tische. Wenn man zu 4. ist, wird es sehr gemütlich und abenteuerlich um die kleinen Rundtische. Service: Bisher leider immer seeeeehr langsam und vergesslich. Freundlichkeit ist leider auch nicht die große Stärke des Personals. Aber immer noch voll und ganz akzeptabel. Essen/Trinken: Ist geschmacklich beides ganz gut. Die Cocktails sind Standard und auch das Essen hat mich noch nicht vom Hocker gerissen. Es kommt hier allerdings auch sehr stark drauf an wer kocht. Mal sind die Burger/Rippchen sehr lecker und mal total zäh/trocken. Preis-Leistung: Die Preise sind akzeptabel. Besonders die Cocktail-Happy-Hour bis 20 Uhr sollte man nutzen. Fazit: Nettes Ambiente, aber zum richtig schönen Abend mit tollen Essen und Trinken reicht es leider nicht.\n",
      "Tolles Ambiente wird zerstört durch lange Wartezeiten und schlechtem Essen. Auch die Cocktails sind nicht gut gemixt, die Gläser außen klebrig und die Preise leicht überteuert. Wir sind damals weiter gezogen und haben uns nach der Enttäuschung im Joe Pena's die leckeren Cocktails mixen lassen. Sehr schade da ich das Ambiente mit den verschiedenen Stockwerken, Balkonen und Terrassen sehr angenehm und einladend finde. Ich hoffe, dass hier stark nachgebessert wird. Dann komme ich gerne wieder und ändere die Bewertung um.\n",
      "Service ok, essen ok aber nichts besonderes eben . Wenn einen amerikanischen Namen hat und auch noch damit wirbt erwartet man mehr...\n",
      "Das Juleps in Esslingen ist einfach zu empfehlen. Ich war diesen Sommer öfters dort. Sehr schön ist die Tereasse im Dick Areal. Cocktails und Essen haben immer super geschmeckt. Was fürs Auge (und natürlich auch für den Gaumen) sind die \"Türmchen\" auf denen verscheidene Snacks serviert werden.\n",
      "Das Restaurant ist sehr groß, bequem, aber sehr laut. Der Service ist freundlich aber sehr verpeilt. Haben Getränke bestellt, das erste Getränk kam sofort, das zweite erst nach mehrmaligen Fragen. Das Besteck wurde uns erst vorgelegt als wir danach fragten; das Essen war zu dem Zeitpunkt bereits da. Hab mir einen Burger bestellt, den hätte ich besser hinbekommen mit den ganzen Fertigzutaten. Einmal und nie wieder.\n",
      "Das Juleps ist im Vergleich zum daneben liegenden Joe Penas (das das nahezu identische Konzept fährt) die eindeutig bessere Wahl. Die Cocktails sind einfach klasse, das Essen schmeckt im Großen und Ganzen wirklich gut, auch wenn es nicht gerade billig ist. Abgesehen davon ist der Service wesentlich freundlicher als in vielen anderen Bars (inkl. Joe Penas). Das Ambiente hat auf jeden Fall etwas!\n",
      "Das Essen schmeckt, wie immer gut. Die Bedienung ist freundlich und baut zum Teil Kontakt zu den Gästen auf. Es werden neue Getränke vorgeschlagen, die es erst seit kurzem gibt. Manchmal wird gefragt, ob man irgendwo etwas dazu haben will und sich so einen individuellen Cocktail machen lassen will. Alles auf eine Art und Weise, die freundlich, aber nicht aufdringlich ist und man sich nicht schon \"fast\" verpflichtet fühlt etwas zu bestellen. Ich kann eigentlich nicht mehr viel (zum oberen Abschnitt und) zum ersten Beitrag hinzufügen außer, dass die Toiletten/ Räume nicht gerade die neuesten sind. Sie sind nicht unsauber, aber das Wasser ist ziemlich kühl und an der Wand geht langsam, die Tapete ab. Unterm Strich kann ich es dennoch fast nur empfehlen. (3,8 Sterne von 5; MB)\n",
      "I had been craving for mexican/asian fusion for the past weeks and finally convinced by boyfriend to take me there last week. We had the duck tacos to start! (Awesome!) and a plate of guacamole with salsa and chips (not the most impressive but satiated by craving nonetheless). We then decided to order the tower of different appetizers which was quite filling. I would recommend this for a big group of people, not really the best for a couple.\n",
      "Eines unserer Stammlokale in Esslingen. Haben hier schon den ein oder anderen netten Abend verbracht und waren so gut wie immer zufrieden. Das Lokal im Loftdesign bietet verschiedene Sitzmöglichkeiten auf zwei Ebenen so wie einen Außenbereich. Kellner sind meist freundlich und bedienen, was die Getränke angeht, recht schnell. Das Essen lässt jedoch etwas länger auf sich warten, manchmal zu lang. Die Größe der Tische sind bemängelnswert da diese, wenn man etwas Größeres bestellt, nicht ausreichen und ein Barhocker als Beistelltisch genutzt werden muss. Über die Gerichte an sich kann man sich geschmacklich nicht beklagen. Saftiges Steakfleisch, leckere Burger und Cocktails die es in sich haben. Vor allem lohnenswert zur Happy Hour, die jeden Tag zwischen 17 und 20 Uhr stattfindet. Probierenswert ist auch der Soulfood Tower mit diversen Häppchen im Stil der internationalen Küche. Preislich ist das Ganze zwar etwas hoch angesetzt, für das gebotene Essen aber meiner Meinung nach, lohnenswert.\n",
      "Ich war bis jetzt zwei Mal im Juleps. Als Anti-Alkoholiker gefällt mir die große Auswahl an alkoholfreien Cocktails sehr gut. Geschmacklich ist einer besser als der andere. Auch vom Essen war ich beide Male begeistert. Die Portionen sind in Ordnung. Keine riesigen Mengen, aber man steht auch nicht hungrig auf. Geschmacklich ist es sehr gut. Allerdings sollte man eine längere Wartezeit einplanen. Beide Male musste ich fast eine Stunde auf's Essen warten. Wenn man vor hat, danach noch ins Kino nebenan zu gehen, kann es evtl. knapp werden, wenn man nicht großzügig kalkuliert. Die Preise sind gehoben. Aber für die gebotene Qualität (alles frisch zubereitet) bin ich auch bereit, mal etwas tiefer in die Tasche zu greifen. Fazit: Sehr gutes Essen. Gehobene Preise. Extrem lange Wartezeit.\n",
      "Die Essensqualität hat sehr stark nachgelassen. Man hat den Eindruck, dass mittlerweile nur mit Fertigprodukten gearbeitet wird. Bedienung war sehr nett und sehr freundlich, aber vorm Kino gehen wir nächstes Mal woanders hin.\n",
      "Waren heute beim Juleps zum zehnten Mal oder so. Mittlerweile echt eine Katastrophe. Essen ist nach wie vor lecker aber die Bedienungen sind völlig unkoordiniert. Cocktails stehen minutenlang an der Theke obwohl wenig los ist, bis sie serviert werden. Essen werden an falsche Tische gebracht und brauchen sehr lange. Stühle fallen beim bedienen um und das Essen dauert mittlerweile über 40 Minuten. Geschmacklich ist es hier aber immer super! Preise ok.\n",
      "Wir waren an Silvester 12/13 in Juleps zum essen! Die Mehrheit entschied dich für das 3 Gängemenu das auf Tafeln an den Wänden stand. Man konnte sich auch auswählen wie man es zusammenstellt! Gutes Angebot & ein Gruß aus der Bar stand auch noch mit drauf auf der Angebotstafel. AUF NACHFRAGE! Nach einer Stunde bekamen wir ihn. Ein Erdbeerdaiquiri lieblos in nem kleinen 0.1 Gläschen gereicht. Das Essen Ansicht durchschnittlich. ABER bei mehreren am Tisch hat was gefehlt oder es wurde viel zu spät gebracht, da waren andere schon fertig! Cocktails in denen nicht mal Alkohol enthalten war. Sorry aber bei der Menge was wir getrunken haben kann das nicht sein. Im Endeffekt haben wir uns zum Glück alles aufgeschreiben, so dass wir wussten was wir zu bezahlen haben. Der Kellner hat dann plötzlich nicht mehr kapiert das nicht jeder das Menü hatte. Wirr auf seinem Zettel durchgestrichen usw & noch iwielche nicht lustige Witze machen wollen. Sorry aber wenn ich ins caspertheather gehen will dann mach ich das sonstwo! Im Endeffekt hat jede Rechnung gestimmt bis auf meine! Da ich mit meinem Partner zusammen gezahlt habe kam es uns sehr komisch vor das wir im Endeffekt eine viel teurere Rechnung hatten. Dann haben wir uns selber alles noch einmal zusammengerechnet und sind auf 10 Euro weniger gekommen. Bin zu ihm hin und sagte dann, dass das so nicht stimmt und wir auf 10 Euro weniger gekommen sind. Ohne nochmal nachzurechnen gab er uns diese. Komisch?!?! DANKE für dieses bescheidene silvester! Die vergeudenden 400 Euro! Den Rausschmiss wegen Betriebsfeier!!! Und den aller schlechtesten Service den ich jemals erlebt habe! Und das an Silvester!!!!\n",
      "Preise und Bedienung passabel. Ribs waren ganz ok, die Marinade war recht lecker und das Fleisch ziemlich zart, wenn auch ein sehr fettig. Ribs waren aber nicht einmal lauwarm und wurden viel zu schnell geliefert, eindeutig nur aufgewärmt! Dafür sind die Portionen und die Preise dann doch nicht wirklich angemessen. Das Fleisch des Burgers war ebenfalls eindeutig nicht frisch. Der Coleslaw war mehr als dürftig (etwa 1 Gabel) und von den beilagen wird man auch nicht wirklich satt. Cocktails waren Durchschnitt, manche gut manche weniger, ist natürlich aber immer Geschmackssache. Ein weiter Weg lohnt sich allerdings für dieses Restaurant nicht finde ich.\n",
      "Wenn man vor oder nach dem Kino mal etwas essen will ist man hier richtig. Ob Burger oder doch etwas anderes, das Essen hier ist echt in Ordnung. Die Bedienung ist echt freundlich und meistens auch echt schnell. Hier kann man immer wieder herkommen...\n",
      "Wegen Reichtum Geschlossen. Dann denkt euch euer Kommentar.\n",
      "Es war einmal ein Lokal im Industriedesign namens Stahlwerk, das der Traum eines jeden war, der Lofts und Industriedesign liebt. Um uns eine Beleidigungsklage zu ersparen, schreiben wir jetzt nicht was wir von jenem Menschen halten, der diesen schönen Raum mit einer geschmacklosen Riesentreppe einfach kaputt gemacht hat. Vielleicht findet er eines Tages einen Beruf, der seiner Qualifikation entspricht. Das amerikanische Essen und die Drinks sind ganz ok, das Personal könnte manchmal schneller sein, aber wenn man nach ein paar Drinks die Augen schliesst, kann man die Treppe vergessen\n",
      "Wir wollten vorm Kino nur noch mal eben schnell ein Bier trinken. Der Laden war gerappelt voll, aber wir haben von dem freundlichen Empfangsherr sofort einen Tisch zugewiesen bekommen. Unsere 2 Getränke kamen auch sehr schnell und so kamen wir auch noch rechtzeitig zu Filmbeginn im Kino an. Mit ein bisschen mehr Zeit kommen wir gerne mal wieder.\n",
      "Leute, das ist mit Abstand die schlechteste Location wo ich je gewesen bin. Genervter und ungelernter Service - keine Ahnung von nichts. Habe 26 minuten auf eine !!!! gewartet und knapp eine Stunde auf meinen Burger der zuvor ewig lange in einer Art Aufzug stand und wirklich komplett kalt und ungenießbar war. Nach einem Bissen bin ich aufgestanden und woanders was Essen gegangen. Diese Location ist absolut nicht zu empfehlen!!!\n",
      "Gute burger, sehr sehr freundliche Bedienung! Klare Empfehlung\n",
      "Well, this is my first time writing for a food court vendor but honestly once I tasted their food , I felt like I was in a restaurant but this kind of food comes from a food court vendor. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a food court vendor that is operating in conjunction with their main restaurant , Vince Seafood and BBQ , which is located just steps away from the food court. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a great place for customers to have a quick , hot, fresh , and tasty meal that can be eaten at the food court or be available for take-out. Rather than having a sit down meal at the nearby restaurant, customers can expect to have quick and efficient meals in a matter of minutes. Vince does the classic stir fry dishes to perfection. They stick to the classics and customers will be able to enjoy these dishes for a good price. They have great combinations in terms of dinner where you can make a selection of how many dishes you would want. For example, you can select 3 items, which includes rice and soup, from their special combo menu for $19.50 plus taxes. This is a great deal if you are feeling a bit off take out for an evening dinner. In terms of the fried noodles and rice, the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $5-$7, and you will not be disappointed, they are absolutely amazing. The BBQ selection is astonishing, I have not had good Chinese BBQ for a long time, and if you want a taste of authentic Chinese BBQ, this is the place to go. If you can't decide what to order, I would recommend trying the Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice, Stir Fired Beef with Seasonal Vegetables, Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, or their BBQ items with Noodles in Soup. I will defintely be coming to this food court vendor for a long time. Before I forget, try their Soya Sauce Chicken Leg Special ! $0.99 for a chicken leg, what a deal !\n",
      "Good dim sum and reasonable prices. The food came very quickly and tasted good and fresh. The specials are cheap and the staff are quite friendly. The washrooms are really gross.....i wouldn't recommend going before eating as you'd probably loose your appetite.\n",
      "This will probably be my last time visiting this place. My family and I came here earlier tonight for a Mother Day's dinner. We ordered a set meal and the dishes came out at a decent time, and the food was good. It wasn't until near the end of dinner when we called for the bill my mom noticed on the slip of paper with our order written that one of the dishes didn't come. So we asked the waitress about it and she apologized and that she'll check. My mom told her no need since we're finished with dinner and would like to cancel that dish, but the waitress told her if the kitchen is making the dish then we can't cancel. Anyway, by the time the dish arrived our table was already cleared. The waitress sets our table again - yes I know, just to eat one dish? We didn't even want it anymore, the food did not taste good bc it came out cold! After, the waitress came and said she'll bring us the desserts...well that took around 20 minutes! At this point, everyone was pretty much pissed out. Overall, service was average..several times the servers either forgot to bring us refill of teas or brought us the wrong order and of course they forgot one of our orders. This was actually our second time that this had happened, the first time was on Chinese New Years - but we understood bc it was extremely busy and everyone's running around. But tonight wasn't too busy I thought..\n",
      "My dad and I came here for dim sum. It's $1.98 before 11:30 am and there's no tea charge. However, there is a tablecloth fee and the price varies depending on the table size. Since there was only the two of us, it was $1 for the small table. We ordered 5 dishes - sweet corn and pumpkin congee, chicken feet in soy sauce, egg with ginger sauce, Shanghai style bun and sweet egg yolk cake. What I like about this restaurant is the selection of food they offer. Also, everything came really quick and tasted awesome. The sweet corn and pumpkin congee wasn't the best I've ever had but it was still decent. I've had sweet egg yolk cake before at another restaurant and hated it but I thought it tasted really good here. Lastly, the service here was great. We weren't regular customers here and I felt that the waitresses treated us very well. They were considerate enough to keep our dessert warm by keeping the cover on the bamboo container.\n",
      "After a quick trip around the Pacific Mall, my family decided to get a quick Chinese dinner meal at Vince's BBQ. It was a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty packed with local Cantonese speaking people. It looks like your typical Chinese seafood place and can be used as a wedding banquet reception hall during the weekends. We ordered the $48 family meal which included chicken soup, bean curd and bok choy, red snapper fish, pan fried beef and mushrooms, and a plate of BBQ duck and pork. There are decent portions and we were pretty full by the end of the meal. My favorite dish had to be the beef and mushrooms and the bean curd with bok choy. The red snapper fish was flavorless and there wasn't much BBQ meat to go around for four people. As far as the food goes, I would have given this place four stars. However, I had to take away one star due to the service. The hostess was nice but the food came out really slow. There was seriously 15 minutes between each plate. Other tables were also complaining that the service was too slow and that they weren't receiving their food. We didn't know if it was because there weren't enough people working in the back kitchen or if they didn't have enough food to feed everyone. In any case, we could have saved quite a bit of time if the service had been quicker. FYI: The waiters speak English but the waitresses don't.\n",
      "We had dinner combo the first time been there. Roasted Duck was amazing. Duck skin was really crispy. Lobster with Noddles was quite tasty too. The second time we decided to try the dim sum, which is the lowest price I've seen. But the quality really let me down. The shanghai bun was cold. Veggie tofu roll tasted awful, the mushroom filling had gone bad I think. I would recommend dinner for sure, but certainly not a good dim sum place.\n",
      "Located just 15 minutes from home. Went here often before it was Vince's. The food has definitely gone downhill since the old restaurant closed(name escapes me). Portions i find are a bit small and dim sum is quite expensive due to their \"special\" selections which cost a lot more. Dim sum quality lacks in taste and i guess the only positive thing i can recall is the service. Head somewhere else people...better options in the area.\n",
      "I really want to give Vince more stars, but I can't per the dinner last evening. The main reason for the low rating was the inefficiency of the kitchen. We placed our orders at 6:38pm (the ticket was time stamped). We ordered a seafood tofu hot pot and a honey and pepper eel dish. The hot pot arrived in 15 minutes. The eel arrived at around 7:30pm. Yap, it was a whole 35 minutes wait for the second dish. We asked the waitress to follow up on the eel dish twice. A manager finally lost it and took our ticket to the kitchen to follow up the third time. (At least the service on the restaurant front was good). I noticed that 2 other tables around us also asked to follow up on their orders. To be fair, both the hot pot and the eel dish were delicious without being oily at all. The hot pot was of reasonable portion size, and the eel dish was a bit smaller than average, but this was well compensated by the deliciousness. I have always enjoyed the overall dining experience at Vince since it has opened. I enjoy its dinner more than its dim sum. I hope the kitchen has had an off night yesterday only. I will surely return to dine again and update the rating. I hope the experience will be better.\n",
      "We normally head here for dim sum early in the morning and there's less crowd. Dim sum is $2.28 for all sizes before 11am. Pretty much everything on the menu is quite tasty. My only complaint is that the seating is very tight. You can barely walk between tables.\n",
      "This is my family's to-go place for dim sum (generally on weekends). Their food quality is quite good especially for the price being paid, so the overall customer value is great. The main dim sums are cheaper before 11AM on weekends, but its only $0.20 more expensive after 11AM anyway. Even if you go on weekends, the line up is quite short. Their service is pretty good too and the servers are friendly. The restaurant itself is bright and somewhat spacious. And most importantly, you can find the common goodies there.\n",
      "I came here a few times while I was visiting Toronto because they have like, everything you'd ever want for dinner. Seriously. When I was a kid, you could only get these dishes for like, a special occassion. But imagine going on a random Thursday and ordering peking duck, and crispy skinned pork and jelly fish, delicious steamed lobster. Just because it's a Thursday. Soooo in other words, prices here are crazy reasonable enough that you can come here on a random weekday and decide you feel like having all those awesome dishes you could only have once a year when you were a kid for the price of any regular Chinese dinner. Why only the two-stars then? Service here is definitely hit or miss. One time I went and it was gold. I was ready to throw down 5 stars. The next time I came was for my mom's birthday dinner. That's a big deal. But everything went wrong that night. They messed up dishes, things came cold, some things came tasting off, they sat us in an area that was pretty much a freezer despite the fact the rest of the restaurant was fairly open. So you'll have to take your chances with this place. if I go back one more time and the place is decent, I'll keep my star rating at 3. Otherwise, I'll send another review to drop it down one. Just a customer beware sorta deal. You've been warned!\n",
      "We came here for a CNY dinner so it was super pricey, and the service wasn't there. The waitress didn't serve the food, which is what typically happens during holiday dinners. She rather stood around. Don't expect service.. They do have some of the best bbq pork I've had in my entire life though. Everything else was decent but nothing special especially considering it was a CNY dinner.\n",
      "Great prices. S, M, L all 2ish per dish; dim sum all day. Lots of choices. Cash only. Def try the special dishes on the back of the menu as well. My personal favourites are the XO pan fried turnip patties, and the duck skin fried rice.\n",
      "Food was good. Really the food would have had me coming back. The service was just terrible. I don't have a high standard for service when I am at HK Style Restaurants because unfortunately, poor service & HK restaurants generally go hand in hand. I mean the service is efficient, but poor. Under-staffing and tip management is the main reason to blame, but that's a whole other story, for another time. The service at this restaurant was depressing. I got number for a table of 2 for me and my gf. We're a small table so it was hard to flag anyone down. The boss is too busy servicing the big table customers, and so are the service captains. One of the waitresses that finally serviced our table did so very reluctantly. Gave us almost a \"god, why are you even here, and sitting in my section?\" feeling. The waitress that ended up servicing our table in the end (due to the fact that we were unable to flag down the same waitress again) was very friendly. Oh and our tea pot came with a side of grease and sauce. Yummy. So we ordered a cup of ice water. The cup was pretty dirty, so instead of telling them, we just ordered another cup of ice water--still dirty. Food was great, everything else, not so much. Won't be coming back until new management/owner.\n",
      "Came here with unrelated Chinese 'family' for a huge dim sum lunch. We ordered tons and tons of stuff (see picture). Everything was quite good, some particular standouts include their fried sesame ball with egg yolk dessert ('Jeen Diu') and their Har Gow/Siu Mai. Would avoid the steamed bun with the glutinous rice filling though. Bland and fills you up unnecessarily - save room for the other good stuff instead! Everything is steamed/fried fresh to order, which is refreshing compared to other places. For dessert, the sweet deep fried Taro 'fry' is their speciality, apparently from the Chiu Chow part of Guangzhou Province in China. It tastes like a glorified french fry coated in coarse sugar - so amazing for some people and meh for some others. Didn't see what the total price came out to, but if you come on weekdays before 4 I believe, it's 2.28 for everything, which is amazing value compared to all the other Dim Sum joints I've been to.\n",
      "Looking for good and cheap dim sum places? this is the spot to go! $1.98/dish during weekdays and $2.38 on weekends Unlike every other $2 dim sum spots, Vince restaurant offers both value AND quality. Menu is extensive, they have 7 different kinds of fillings in their rice rolls, and 6 different buns. Everything came out relatively warm, made fresh. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but because of the value, and comparison to other Chinese $2 Dim sum places, this is where you will get the most bang for your buck.\n",
      "2.5*. The food was mediocre. The service wasn't great. First, we were put in the small and dark back room (storage room?) when there were empty tables at the back upper section of the main restaurant. Then they forgot to give us the dim sum menu. Then we had to ask two times for hot sauce. The SP dish - curry octopus- was over priced compared to the amount and quality of food received. Our tea which they charged for was good and the staff was good about ensuring this was filled. This was our second time there and we will not be returning. Too many other places to go to in Markham.\n",
      "LOBSTER SPECIAL ALERT !!! Limited time only $5.99 lb when ordering over 8 lb lobster In comparison; other restaurants will charge $15.99 lb for lobster Make reservations because many people are coming for the special pricing We ordered one of the largest lobsters I'd ever seen. A single 12 lb monster of a lobster. The claw itself was larger than 2 hands put together. Even though the lobster was so large and so old it still had the same taste and texture of smaller lobsters. However, if I were able to turn back time I would have order two 6 lb lobsters to get more tail meat. Deep fried salted eel $22.95 - decent but I would rather have fried eel with a sweet honey sauce or Chinese XO sauce (3 stars). Sweet and sour pork was nice and crunchy but not overly hard and not overly battered (4 stars). Beef sirloin was done very well with the caramelized onions but portion was small (4 stars). Service was a bit slow because of how busy they were.\n",
      "Update: roast pork continues to be incredibly delicious. Deep fried lobster and deep fried crab claw are excellent. So are the noodles that come in your standard ten course dinner. Way to step it up, guys!!!\n",
      "I've been going back to Vince regularly each week for the past month and I've decided to upgrade it by one star because the service has improved since I last reviewed the restaurant. I find that going early in the morning when the restaurant opens is the best time to go. It's not so busy at that hour and service tends to be more attentive. If you go often enough and the waiters recognize you, they will obviously treat you better. I still think the dim sum here is good. I recommend the shrimp dumpling in papaya soup and their rice noodle rolls. Sometimes the latter is hit or miss, but generally, I find that Vince makes one of the best rice noodle rolls in town! The skin is thin and wrapped tightly around the contents, which is how rice noodle rolls are supposed to be made. So what made me come back to Vince in the first place? I was looking for a restaurant that's nice and quiet on a weekend morning and this place doesn't really get busy until 10:00 AM, and what brought me back a second and third time is that the service gradually improved with each visit. Most of all, I can yum cha for hours and they won't rush me.\n",
      "Vince Seafood Restaurant & BBQ has one of the most value in weekday dim sum offering around on a weekday morning! Before 11 am, it is 10% off $2.28 S/M/L size and free tea. Not surprisingly that it was packed with seniors that ordering a lot food to take out for lunch and dinner later to enjoy. Dim Sum menu is quite interesting with a mix of classical and chiu chow style dim sum. And at this price point, my Yelp friend ordered quite a few and more from the menu. Shrimp Dumpling \"Har Gow\" - A-OK Pork Dumpling with Liver on Top \"Siu Mai\" - Meh, not crazy about overcooked liver Pork Rib with Black Bean and Olive Sauce - good portion Bean Curd Skin Roll with Mix Chinese Vegetable - lacking filling Dumpling in Lotus Leaf - love this! great contrast of taste and texture! Beef Tender in Spicy Sauce - Tender enough but really lacking any spice, more on the sweet side Crystal Dumplings in Fish Papaya Soup - huge dumplings!!! shrimp has great bite! Roast Pork Belly Roll - Not fatty enough and a little dry Rice Roll with Whole Shrimp - shrimp quite mushy and rice roll itself a little too thin Overall the quality and quantity are great! A little mix up here and there but service is friendly and decent. My Yelp friend wants to try the Steamed Fish Intestine Egg Custard... I guess have to come back another time for that!\n",
      "This place is really good! The food is tasty and price is amazing for what you get. The place looks decent too and service is not bad. Came here twice and had lobster both times, both times were delicious. Their other dishes like the fish, beef, chicken etc were all pretty good as well. I'd also really recommend their \"Wintermelon soup\" for $20, but make sure you preorder it! Just a warning you should bring someone who knows Chinese though. I think it'll make your time here easier.\n",
      "The meal was well prepared. The food was juicy and not dry. The waiters was really helpful. My opinion is that you can't eat the same food anywherelse\n",
      "I vow to avoid this store as much as possible. Smugness is not a virtue yet some of the employees at this store can teach a class on it. I did shop here knowing their prices were high yet it was convenient. Yet due to their employees poor attitudes, other stores will get my business.\n",
      "Always helpful staff. Super convenient and easy to get in and out of. Small selection of juices for this gurl who loves her fresh juices. Tip: Check out their clearance area. I've got some great ASU gear from them!\n",
      "I come here only when there's a deal or for the fried chicken... But I try to avoid coming as much as possible. The staff can be very rude and snobbish (for someone working a menial job).\n",
      "I usually go for their dairy products like gallons of milk, eggs, and yogurts. Friendly staffs and helpful employees.\n",
      "They have a meatless section! Although there's a sign on the board, there really isn't a lot of selection for vegetarian alternatives in the frozen section. Was a little underwhelmed when I saw the sign -- I thought maybe I had found a little frozen vegetarian paradise. Turns out that's not the case.\n",
      "What splendid company and breakfast! This is our first time staying in a B&B in Europe. The accommodation was very roomy and comfortable. The bathroom was large and there were lots of nice natural light. Room had tv, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and biscuits. The building is stone and WiFi can be difficult (like any accommodation that is stone built). Once you sit in the dining room WiFi was fine. The location is fantastic, far enough from the crowd and close enough to walk to all the tours sites. We were suggested to walk through the gardens that sits parallel to the main Princess street. It's beautiful with all the flowers as we stroll through this garden to the National Gallery and to the Old City. The B& B is near the off and on bus line one short block away. We were situated in a lovely courtyard. Don't let the initial entry into the building fool you. We were a bit taken back with it too when we first got there. Once inside the B & B, all is well. It's spartan and clean. The conversation and knowledge from our hosts is what made our stay nice. Each breakfast (which sometimes linger for 2 hours because of our conversation) has really made our trip personal. We were there for 3 mornings. If you want to understand from a local perspective, this is the way to go. Take part of their history with you. Our host Duncan is fluent in at 3 to 4 languages and worked for many years as a tour guide all over Europe. His love for history is evident in his knowledge of all that he advises about what to see while in Scotland. His recommendations for sight seeing and schedule of when to get there as well as restaurants were dead one. Our other host Walter (pictured here) was a delight! He shared a local perspective and insight. Thank you for the wonderful company and for the scrumptious breakfast.\n",
      "Die Ausstattung entspricht dem Alter des Gebäudes. Dafür liegt es sehr zentral ganz in der Nähe der Princes Street. Diese zentrale Lage macht sich auch am Preis bemerkbar. Duncan, Chef des Hauses, ist ein vorbildlicher Gastgeber und auf seine Tipps, was Sehenswürdigkeiten betrifft, kann man sich verlassen. Desweiteren spricht er sehr gut deutsch.\n",
      "Tried out the new location tonight. Great beer, the food was ok but the service was horrible. Food took over 1 hour and our server just disappeared. We ended up checking out at the bar. I'd go back but I would never eat there again.\n",
      "Soooooo.....torn between a 2 and a 3 here. Stopped in during a business trip looking for a good beer and food. The good - this place has a great outdoor seating area with loads of picnic tables and lawn area to hang out. Location is near airport in a very nondescript industrial zone. Inside the facility is REALLY loud - they were less than 50% of capacity and the ambient noise was pretty loud. Now for the food....ordered the black and blue burger and the burger itself was OK. Nothing spectacular but also not remarkable. The fries were the worst ever - lukewarm and chewy. How do you make French fries chewy?? Seriously??? OK....moving on from that. When I told my server about the fries she feigned interest but didn't go any further than that. After thinking this over I'm going with the 2. I'm not a huge fan of German beer so am not taking the beer quality into consideration in my review.\n",
      "We decided to go here for a late lunch/early dinner yesterday. We split a sausage plate and got 4 different kinds - Kielbasa, Weiss Wurst, Spicy Beef and something else. They tasted good at the time, but after we got home, my stomach was shot for the rest of the night and this morning. We also decided to split the apple strudel dessert - it's the only one they have and it sounded good and was recommended to us by our waitress. I took one bite and didn't have any more - the strudel was burnt. It was literally black all over. The ice cream had freezer burn on it. I'm normally not so particular and will eat most things at a restaurant, but this was so bad. When I told the waitress, she apologized and took it off the bill right away. It was an okay experience overall. It was a big let down from out first time going here.\n",
      "Cool place, lots of care taken in its decor and construction - nice place to grab one and the pig picking and corn hole tournament event was really fun. Service - great!\n",
      "Nice place, (however i think they are moving to a new location soon). The setting is of a old german brewhouse, which is very fun. They serve food along side their brews. The have the beer that they have available on a chalk board on the side of the rooms, make sure to check out the seasonal. I recommend the \"hornets nest\" if available. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Also you can get 2 types of growlers to take beer with you.\n",
      "Solid brewery. I love the atmosphere, nice outside seating and the inside is really neat. Good beer, have yet to try the food, but that's on my list to do. I wish they had more of a selection of brews. This summer, they've only had 2 or 3 on tap and I really want to see what else they can come up with. Recently, maybe the past 2 times, their beers haven't been hitting the spot for me (I've been here maybe 8-10 times this summer drinking there and taking a growler to go). Like another reviewer said, they tasted skunky. I don't know if that's just my taste buds changing or if it's actually the beer, but something was off the last time I went. I've been living in Charlotte since May and I've began to notice how many restaurants have OMB on draft. This makes me really happy because I can get local beer at a lot of the other restaurants and bars I frequent. I even looked up the list of restaurants in Charlotte and the surrounding areas that have OMB on tap and the list seemed endless!\n",
      "Visited OMB this past weekend for Mecktoberfest. The event has grown in size since we were there 2 years ago, so the outdoor tent was much bigger and food was included with the $25 price of admission, as were 2 beers. We were also given some sort of ticket for a prize drawing, which we never actually saw take place. There were only 3 beers on tap, Copper, Captain Jack and Mecktoberfest. It's disappointing to go for an all out \"Oktoberfest\" and get your choice of wow... Three whole beers. Captain Jack was way too hoppy and Mecktoberfest was too sweet, so I settled on Copper. The food was served by a catering company. I had the pulled pork which honestly, was the worst pulled pork I've ever eaten, anywhere. Baked beans from a can were also a disappointment. We purchased a pretzel later in the evening, which was cold. Definitely don't go to Mecktoberfest expecting decent food. Between dodging the cigar smoke everywhere outside, and the smell of feces inside (it was later reported by a guy in our group that someone had done something tremendously foul inside the men's bathroom - so over the top I can't even explain here) the evening would have been a bust if it wasn't for the company I was with. By 9PM the place seemed mostly empty, no one was outside and the band stopped playing, so we left. Overall, not nearly as enjoyable as our first visit to Mecktoberfest 2 years ago, which included much larger steins of beer instead of 21 ounce mugs. I'm not highly motivated to return to OMB for any events.\n",
      "Yet another place that I have been wanting to check out for a while. The wife and I were in the area and decided to stop by for a beer and do just that. Unless you live in the South End, it can be a little out of the way to get here, but definitely worth the effort. We weren't sure what to expect, but overall it's a taproom attached to their main brewery operation, which also serves food. The food menu can best be described as German inspired pub food, but we did not partake in anything but beer. I really like their Dunkel so I opted for that and the wife is more of a barreled beer fan and she chose their bourbon barreled porter called Fat Boy. For my palate, both of those beers are some of their best. From what I could see from their beer menu, they offer several sizes from samplers all the way to pitchers. The service was good and attentive, and you can order at the bar as well as table service is provided. They also have some outside seating with games like corn hole making it a great place for groups. Next time, we will have to sample some of the food.\n",
      "If you love german beer, this is your new favorite place. It should be noted that this is a brewery not a bar, so the food selection is limited and if you don't like beer well you better like water or soda. We came down last year while visiting friends and now it is a must do when we are in Charlotte. Great place to grab a few pints and then take some growlers home so you can continue to enjoy the deliciousness.\n",
      "First off, I generally do not like most US. micro breweries. With that said this place is different- it's ALL about the beer, and they have done a great job. Cheers!\n",
      "Awesome place to hang out, super relaxed.\n",
      "I am a fan of micro breweries and having local breweries when visiting an area. The beers were very good. I had a flight (small glasses of the four beers for $3) that consisted of the Fruehbock, the Captain James Jack Pilsner, the OMB Copper and the Winter - Dunkel (dark) Lager. My favorite was the Dunkel, but I thought they were all delicious. I wish I had made it in time to go on the free brewery tour. I also like how they offer the ability to buy refillable growlers of their beer.\n",
      "Had a random Tuesday afternoon free in Charlotte, so being the beer lover I am, I yelped breweries in the area and the OMB popped up. They were open from 4 to 8pm and apparently Tuesday is pint night (discounted beers). It was pretty easy to find, just look for all the cars! I was doing this outing solo, so it was kind of nerve racking that there were so many people there, but I can't blame them....nice weather and good brews, I'd be there too if I lived in the area! The inside is a big open room decorated in German beer hall style with picnic tables, and smaller tables for couples (or just me) with more seating outside. I got a sampler platter of the 5 beers they had on tap. Three ounce tastings of 5 beers for $3...not bad! My favorite was the wheat, but they were all pretty good. You can also buy growlers and have them refilled for a low cost, wish more bars would do this! I checked out the menu, and reluctantly decided against the bratwurst panini....it looked good =) They are open most evenings with free tours on Saturdays. While being in a crowded brew hall solo was a little weird, I'm glad I ventured out to taste some of the beers Charlotte has to offer. This place would be a great week day hang out for friends or family.\n",
      "I'm a sucker for microbreweries but this 5 star review goes beyond \"cool because its local small business\". The Copper is delicious, and I order it almost every time I have the opportunity (we also have one of their refillable carboys, so having this at home has become beyond cheap). 6 months ago, you could find it in a tiny handful of local restaurants and bars - now, there are upwards of 40 places serving OMB. Awesome. The Pilsner we sampled Saturday was good, too - tart, a little floral - and they're supposedly releasing a Bock this week. Which is also awesome. Additional awesomeness, and a reason to visit - the space is open, airy, but comfy - high stools and tables, high backed booths, easy, friendly service. Despite being hidden in a somewhat industrialized area off of South blvd, I could hang here all day. Especially if they got some Veg Brauts out there on the cart. The tour was rad because, well, hey, you're surrounded by a sea of delicious beer, but other than that - it was interesting to learn that OMB imports all their grain from Germany, meaning that what goes into the brew is high quality stuffs. The tour was given (and is often given, says he) by a dude from the CLT Homebrewer's Association, awesome thing number gazillion. Our first microbrewery! Go and give them money, now.\n",
      "I've been a fan of OMB since they premiered in 2009. Their beer has come a long way and is still in a state of evolution. If you've yet to try it, stop by the brewery for your first taste. The tap room is styled like the Bavarian bierhaus, with wood community tables, high open-beamed ceilings, and lots of dark wood panels. Don't arrive expecting expansive walls of TVs...it's a brewery tap room, not a sports bar. But you can expect great service from the friendly staff. Pop in on the weekends and you can get a 45 minute \"tour\" of the brewery. You don't get to really wander the warehouse, but you can come face-to-face with the machinery and learn about the history of OMB and their beer making process - great afternoon if you have a beer-lover visiting for the weekend! The beer itself is generally good. Copper, their flagship, has been hit-or-miss for me, but their seasonal releases are where the good stuff is at. They have German-inspired snacks from the kitchen, too. OMB was the catalyst for Charlotte's craft beer explosion - stop by and see where it all began.\n",
      "Came here for my cousins wedding-who would have thunk to have a reception at a brewery!? This place was AWESOME. We had the left side of the brewery reserved with the outdoor deck which was perfect- Beer was delicious and heavy and the service was great! We also was able to tour the brewery- way cool.\n",
      "OMB is great! The beer is awesome, the taproom is warm and inviting and the staff is very welcoming and helpful. The few (very few) bad reviews I've read on this site about OMB are ridiculous. The place is great! If you're a fan of fresh beer, then I recommend you get down there ASAP! Support local beer!\n",
      "Still love this place and the \"beer tasting beer\". My wife and I just visited the new location and expanded Biergarten. Fantastic! I hope the get a more permanent beer kiosk for the Biergarten -- perhaps a chinesisch Tür like englischen Gärten im München. The lines are shorter outside, but the beer is colder inside. The food options have expanded and this place will be on our return list, and always near the top.\n",
      "Nice microbrewery. Great food. Just know that the food comes out on of paper plates and plastic utensils. I would pay a dollar more for real plates and utensils. But it's okay as is.\n",
      "Simple, laid back & very casual. Copper is the best beer!! Food is good and service is quick. Plus they have FREE Yoga on Tuesday nights started by LuLuLemon. What could be better than yoga and beer?? Best tip about this place: they have \"OMB coins\" that you use like money - as if you're a leprechaun or 10yrs old in an arcade - so fun!!\n",
      "We've been loving OMB beers for 2 years now, and are really glad that the full kitchen is now open! Head out on Friday night for beer, dinner, and live music, or Saturday afternoon for football and a tour. Also, be sure to get tickets for Mecktoberfest (October 1st, 2011) because that is a day of fun that you'll be sorry to miss.\n",
      "Of all the breweries I visited in Charlotte, this was was the most interesting. Everything here is from Germany, even the furniture. From what was explained in the tour, the owner wanted to keep everything in a strict fashion as to the way beer is made in Germany. While I didn't really learn anything new on the tour about how beer is made, I have to say that the delivery of the information was the best I've seen. The guy giving the tour was extremely knowledgeable. One thing I did find interesting about the brewery was that they keep their own yeast cultures which isn't something you see a ton of these days. I tried a flight with an extra tasting on the side so that I could try everything they had available that day. My personal favourite of the day was the Captain Jack. The Domm Kolsch was good also and it was cool to find out that it came from a home brewer who won a contest. While OMB's beers weren't my favourite of the Charlotte breweries I visited I would recommend anyone to come check these guys out.\n",
      "Let me start by saying I am not on the IPA bandwagon that everyone else is, instead my favorites are - you guessed it - German-style brews. I can't think of a single OMB beer that I haven't liked - I think Copper appeals to the most people, but I love Dunkel, Mecktoberfest, Fruh Bock...oh who am I kidding, I love them all. I definitely recommend visiting if you haven't already. The \"tasting room\" is designed to be like a German tasting hall and the feel is great. You can order at the bar or they have waitresses. The food has made a big improvement over the years, last visit we had pretzels and they were a million times better than they used to be. But can we get some beer cheese in here? We've been so many times, but this last trip was the first time we took a tour. (By the way, it was their 5th anniversary. They started this craft beer thing in Charlotte.) The tour lasted about 30 minutes and took you through the history, brew process, growth plans, etc. I really enjoyed it and our tour guide was really entertaining and knowledgeable. The space is huge, I had no idea. And as big as everyone thinks OMB is, the guide said they only represent one half of one percent of the Charlotte beer market. I guess there are still lots of Bud drinkers out there? Whyyyyyyy???? They are moving to a new space 200 yards away in early June, so I definitely recommend checking out the old space before they vacate. I'm eager to see how the new space stacks up.\n",
      "What a great spot...so glad we found this spot...i will definitely be coming here more often. .i hear they are opening up a spot right down the road can't wait to see how awesome that will be. I will be coming back for sure!!\n",
      "Went on Friday night. 5 minutes at least at the bar to flag down a bartender. Once at a table at least 15 + minutes to flag down a server who told us food would be 1 hour. I left immediately. Went to Macs & got served in minutes. I took a date there & felt like an idiot. Never again!\n",
      "We brought our friends from out of town with us for our first tour here and it was absolutely delightful, and delicious! Our tour guide, Josh, was friendly, funny, knowledgeable and truly enjoys his job, as well as his beer! My personal favorite beer of the day was Captain Jack. I look forward to a \"refresher\" tour again in the near future.\n",
      "Yesterday I went to the brewery with friends and wondered why I had never been there before! The beer was awesome, and the bourbon beer was especially delicious. I went on a tour of the brewery (which is free!) with jimmy and it was great! He was so knowledgable and entertaining, and I was surprised about how much you actually get to see while on the tour. Great spot and I'll definitely be back!\n",
      "Pretty spiffy spot during the day time! Location - easy to get to, off Old Pineville Street. Parking lot seems ample, if you get there early enough. Street parking will suffice, if there are none Inside - I like the set up, there are three different areas where you can lounge - two outside patios on a warm breezy day, inside with the bar is swanky with displays of tshirts and different beer taps, and the other side of the establishment has your counter of beers and extra tables. Service - nice and attentive to your needs. They make sure you are kept hydrated (whether it be beer or water) and picks up your empty mugs. What brought me here? Their Louisana Fest which was awesome! Loved how they set up cornholes, live music, and crawfish/beers -- it was an awesome sunny and breezy day! Would definitely come back again next year. OMB - Please do add mayo to your list of condiments, thanks ^___^.\n",
      "I met some friends here, and I suppose my rating is a bit low, since I am not a beer drinker. There wasn't much else offered to drink besides beer, and for a German themed menu, not to offer Riesling or some other light German wine seemed weird to me. There is no other alcohol here besides beer and wine. So I settled on soda, which had no ice. It appeared there is no ice machine. The menu was limited, and was hard for me to order, since I'm gluten free. I gave it three stars, since I've been to many restaurants where not drinking beer and being gluten-free is not a death sentence for my appetite. If they expanded their menu slightly and offered a small variety of other alcoholic drinks besides beer, I'd go back.\n",
      "Solid beer, great atmosphere, good German food. Gorgeous nite. Very fun place!\n",
      "A brewery less than 5 minutes from my house... What can be better??? This small brewery puts out some really good beers. I am a pale ale kind of guy, but the copper and seasonals are quite tasty. The tour isn't too bad, but due to the size of the place, it is over quickly. This is a great place to go and grab an afternoon beer on the weekend without your typical bar scene.\n",
      "Have been going here since they opened. Great German beer. Copper is my fav by far and I've tried them all including all seasonals. Good atmosphere - they keep improving everytime I visit.\n",
      "It's a nice little place to get some brew. The tour was basic and informative (given by a volunteer local beer brewing enthusiast). The brewery is a fun thing to do and a great place to take a visitor to enjoy some beer. The sad part was that there was no free sample after the tour which was kind of a let down. The tap room is nice. High ceiling, i'm guessing those were German flags in the rafters, a nice long corner bar and plenty of servers. They only had 2 beers on tap at the moment (a third being tapped soon) i did enjoy the Copper more than the other choice. $3.50 for a pint.\n",
      "I drink way less now than I used to at various times in my life. And I was never a huge drinker of beer regardless. Yet it is still nice to see that the Queen City has another local gem in the form of the OMB. Not the first brewery in the city limits by a long shot, yet definitely a different breed than the more corporate stylings of Hops, Rock Bottom or even the now-departed South End. This is more akin to a winery, where you can see the inner workings - and even take a tour if you so choose - partaking of the product at the end. Or even at the beginning, or skipping the tour entirely in favor of the suds. I get that the City of Charlotte has little in the way of country charm, or charm at all for that matter, having long ago forgone those details in the favor of building at all costs. So the one downside is that the OMB is on a side road, in a very industrialized location that you are most assuredly not likely to find unless you really know where you are going, and even once you do, you probably will not be overwhelmed by the exterior of the building. That is truly a shame. Be patient, as the inside is not nice, but it is nicer than the outside by a large margin.\n",
      "Why have I not been here sooner?? Olde Mecklenburg Brewery is great! I went here last night with a friend, we did the tour and hung around for a few beers & a hot pretzel. First, when you're on your way here, it feels like you're going the wrong way. It's tucked back in this industrial area, warehouses, etc. I started driving slower, turned down the music - you know, less music helps you look better - and thought I had made a wrong turn. But then, boom, there it is! They're actually moving up the street this summer, for a bigger brewing space. (Grand opening here I come!) It's really nice in the inside, ridiculously tall ceilings, flags hung up everywhere, a bunch of seat yourself tables. The bar is small, but there are no stools, so it doesn't get crowded. I had the Captain Jack pilsner, and the wheat beer. Both were very good. I prefer lighter beer (really, I prefer cider, haha) and these were great options for me. I got there around 5:50pm, the tour started at 6pm. They recommend that you come a little bit early to grab a beer before the tour starts. (Free tour = no free beer on the tour). It was about an hour, interesting and funny. Then. Oh my goodness then. I was looking around a bit and saw a beautiful looking hot pretzel on someone else's table. The decision to order the hot pretzel may have been my best decision all week. It was so good! Fresh. Perfect. Mmmmm. I'll be back for a beer or three, and I'll probably bring out of town friends here when they visit!\n",
      "Finally got back over to OMB the other night. Love this place! I'm a huge fan of Copper but I tried a couple others on Thursday that were pretty tasty. The Dunkel, a nice dark lager, was very nice. I also tried RPA and liked that one too. They've added a fire pit out front and have added a small kitchen inside (the first time I ever visited they had a guy outside cooking up brats). I didn't have any food while I was there but someone told me the brats were still out of this world. They also serve up the large pretzels. Located in an industial park between South Blvd & S. Tryon, it's a bit of a hall to get over there for me, but when I have a reason to be on that side of town, I'm always looking to stop by for a brew.\n",
      "I fought the pouring rain to find this place close to the train tracks. It doesn't look promising from the outside; less like a brewery and more like a meat packing plant where dreams go to die. I wasn't sure which door to go to, so I wrongly picked the one closest to my car. I found myself in a big empty space with what looked like some kind of class going on. Luckily, someone pointed me to the restaurant portion on the other side of the wall. As much as this place is basically a warehouse, they do a good job on the interior. It is surprisingly welcoming with a ton of dark wood, long tables, German flags hanging from the rafters, and panels on the walls to deaden the noise. I've never been to Germany, but as far as German beer halls go, this one feels right. The room is accentuated by two gigantic windows that gaze upon the brewing operation, which looks quite large from outside. It's probably the best option I've seen as far as giving visitors a glimpse of the brewing equipment without having it all up in their faces or in the way. And the restaurant didn't smell like brewery, so they must do a good job containing odors to the back. The menu is a little limited; it features sausages imported from around the country and sides that can be prepared at the start of the day. I'm guessing they don't really have any cooking equipment in the back. I opted for two sausages - gyulai and knockwurst - and two sides. The sausages were excellent, and the sides were pretty on-point. Fair warning - if you don't like vinegar, don't order the German sides. As for the beer, it is clean and crisp and a damned good representation of the German style. If you don't like simple beers made with quality ingredients - if you must have 10 different malts and 60 plus IBUs - this is not your scene. There's beauty to be found in a well-done lager, though, as there's nothing to hide mistakes. Everything is tasty, but my favorites were the dopplebocks. Then again, that's my favorite style to begin with. And taking it to the next level, they had one of their higher ABV bocks available aged in bourbon barrels. Also my favorite. The beer could have used a little less time in the barrels, as I thought the bourbon stole the show instead of adding a layer of complexity, but it was still damn good. The one negative comment I have is the service, and it wasn't the servers fault. Somebody must have called in sick, because on a Saturday near lunch time they only had two servers and a busser working the giant room. As such, I had to flag people down whenever I wanted something. But once I did, they were friendly and quick. Overall, I'd be back if I lived nearby, both for some sausage and some bock. Well done.\n",
      "Great place to visit, when we went they were revamping the menu so they were limited on what was available because 3 days later they were rolling out something new... the pretzel we had was excellet so hopefully they kept it. Great place to hang w/friends or bring people from out of town, didnt do the tour but would go back. Great service and love supporting local businesses!\n",
      "COPPER...need I say more?! Its worth buying a large bottle of the beer since the refills are so inexpensive! WOW! Make sure to get the tour and fun explanation of their brewing process. I dig the european concept and feel of the place. Its a good time had by all!\n",
      "This place is a great place to hang out. They have a limited but awesome selection of beer that they brew at their location. They also have live menu and a cool food selection. The location is a little off the beaten path but definitely worth checking out!\n",
      "I'll take a Copper please...no wait, a Mecktoberfest...but wait, maybe a Mecklenburger...hmmm...oh hell, I'll have one of each! I'm a huge fan of OMB. Have had in in restaurants for months (the cool places have the local stuff on draft!), but on my recent visit to the actual brewery I was in love. Keep in mind, this is a one year old brewery, so don't go expecting a gift shop and gourmet menu, etc. The OMB tap room makes you welcome by serving great beer in a cool environment. Tables all lined up for people to mingle and sit next to each other with some seating along the side. There is some seating outside too. If you haven't visited OMB before, October is a great time to do it. A little hard to find, but once you do, enjoy!\n",
      "They have added a great deal to their menu int he last few months, the food has been a great upgrade. When one considers their great beer, headlined recently by the award winning Mecktobberfest (Great Amercian Beer Festival), this place is awesome\n",
      "I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this place. Yes, the beer hall atmosphere is nice, but when we went they only had 2 beers. 2 beers?! What kind of brewery only offers 2 beers? They had the signature OMB Copper and Captain Jack Pilsner. We both got the OMB Copper, which was just fine if not particularly unique. The pretzel another reviewer raved about was nothing more than a Superpretzel Soft Pretzel that you can get from the freezer section at Wal-Mart, and the brat wasn't much more impressive. I could see how it might be fun to come here with a big group for a tour and tasting, but don't think I'll be back any time soon...\n",
      "OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had.\n",
      "I get the niche they are going for and the theme for their beer. I'm not saying what they produce is bad - it's just not my type of beer. No IPA or other hoppy beers. Definitely go if you're into lagers, ambers, etc. The atmosphere is great though, I will concede that. However, they are moving so we'll see if that changes.\n",
      "First, let me recommend that you read Amanda F's review. She is right on with her description. So, I'll fill in from there. The menu isn't extensive, but for a brew hall, it is just fine! Several appetizers, sandwiches, and other items. We recently visited OMB for a birthday \"gathering\" and everything we had from the menu was excellent! We tried the pretzel and the Meat and Cheese tray to start. Then we ordered a variety of sandwiches, all of which were quite good! The beer... so Copper is my favorite, but since I was IN the brewery, I decided to try some of the other OMB brews. They offer a flight of four samples for $4. I really enjoyed several of them. Copper is still my favorite, but I'll enjoy some of the others occasionally too! Service was excellent! There was live entertainment outside in the Biergarten which had a respectable crowd gathering too! All in all, it was a very good time, good food, great service, and terrific beer!!\n",
      "I had the \"brat in a bun\" for lunch today and it was delish!!!\n",
      "Currently my favorite Charlotte brewery and a beautiful place. I hope their new location is just as well setup and makes good use of the additional space.\n",
      "I really like it there. It's a really nice, really clean local brew house. The beer is good. The people are nice, but then again, I would be happy too if I worked there. I picked up my first GROWER and I love it. I am hooked.\n",
      "They stay consistent with there theme...from water without ice to canned sodas to the German Purity Laws. OMB produces a consistent product and I'm proud of how well distributed Copper is in Charlotte. Now I need to head back and try the Hornet Hefeweizen. Dunkel was great. I wasn't a fan of the Fruebock, but we all have our tastes and that's not mine. The food was good. Maybe one of these days I'll check out the bicycle group they have.\n",
      "This brewery has two awesome things going for it: Although some claim it's not \"craft beer\" enough, I've never had a beer like it in the states. That's a lot more unique then some douple IPA that every craft brewery has made, right? It's local, and boy do they keep it that way. The beer is made by some exceptionally-tongue-twisting-named German purity law, which means it's only got four ingredients in it - water, yeast, malt, and hops. Not an ounce of preservatives or fillers. Can you seriously argue with that? And I don't care how many IPAs you've drank -- you haven't had anything until you've had a beer that was kegged THAT DAY! Amazing! The tap room also has the best ambiance of any brewery or brew-pub I've been in. Large ceilings, dark wood, long table and German flags hanging on the rafters make for a seriously cozy feeling. Also, I do believe they now have a small kitchen and serve food during all open hours. Hurray!\n",
      "Love this spot. I'm sure people know about it, but I randomly came across it the other day. Someone mentioned that they are going to be relocating just down the street and they will be opening a beer garden. First thing I search for when I moved to Charlotte. Looking forward to many more visits here and more at the new location.\n",
      "Arriving just before 9:30 on a Monday night, our waitress was a doll. She got our order in to the kitchen before closing. Try the Teller with Bratwürst and Frankfurter with potato salad and Rotkohl. Such a fulfilling delight! I love Mecklenburg Brewery!\n",
      "Great, friendly, VERY WELL HIDDEN, place. For connoisseurs of outstanding German-style beer, absolutely fresh, and absolutely authentic. Open Wed. - Sat. closing early every night except Friday--understandable, since it really is a brewery-with-a-pub, not a bar. Great bratwurst & cabbage too. EIN PROSIT!!!\n",
      "Still 5 stars, but with some very worthy additions! 1) The Christmas Market is so much fun! Local merchants, delightful eats and, of course, plenty of beer. Fun for the whole family...except for the beer, if the kids are under age. 2) Their private room is fabulous. Check it out! I hear it fits about 80 people...company party anyone?! 3) Live music! Over the summer and as of late, OMB has done a great job of hosting super cool events like a cornhole tournament and live music at the tasting room. Go. 4) Food. Yup. Now they have a bit of German food to stave off hunger while you're trying their super fresh beer. Brats and more from a very casual food window. Nom nom. Now I just gave you four more reasons to check out OMB if you haven't already. Prost!\n",
      "Disclaimer: I came here to watch the 2014 FIFA World Cup final. Germany vs. Argentina. The OMB will only be like that once every four years. But when it is, it's AWESOME. Everyone is predominantly German, and very, very, very excited. The beer is good, pretty cheap, the finger food hits the stop, and the place is beautiful. High ceilings, tall windows, and wood panel everywhere. World Cup 2018. You should be there.\n",
      "One would be unlikely to stumble upon this location. Camoflauged among several warehouse looking places on an inconspicuous road off of south Tryon, this spot is a brewery first and a place of consumption second. The latter is a small, beerhall style area with high ceilings, long tables and chandeliers. Service is present but could use some work - only after sitting with our beers for a good fifteen minutes did the bartender/server? inform us that she'd forgotten to put in our order until just then. The brats were tasty, served with yummy German inspired sides on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. As a fairly young brewery it is understandable that the beer selection is focused on the two very drinkable standards, copper and mecklenburger, and the rotating seasonal, in winter a dunkel. After noshing we waited for the brewery tour (free on Saturdays!). It started a bit late but we got the beer 101 treatment, and learned all about this young brewery's mantra: fresh beer, pure ingredients, no preservatives, all local. It's promising. Still, none of it's current brews stick out much to me - as a Belgian style/IPA fan, nothing was quite hoppy or spicy enough, although the dunkel has a satisfying roasted flavor. Maybe with some years and experimentation I'll find a beer to love from olde meck. Either way I'd say this spot is worth a visit.\n",
      "Great brewery in Charlotte. The tap room reminds you of something you would see in Germany with the vaulted ceilings and iron chandeliers. I am a big fan of their seasonal beers...especially Mecktoberfest. They have it now and you need to get it as soon as possible. It is easy to drink and has a great full flavor. Just do it. They have live music on Friday nights during the summer. It is so nice to sit out side and listen to music while having 1 or 5 beers. Always a good time!\n",
      "Haven't made it to the actual brewery yet but i plan on it soon. There are two local bars that have there beers and im a huge fan of the OMB copper ale. It taste great and i love how local it is. I drink red oak often but love the fact that there is a brewery here in charlotte doing something right. Cant wait to come check it out.\n",
      "The bones of this brewery are classic in the pint-lifting sense: vaulted ceilings, lots of group seating, plenty of open space, three sizes available for all brews. I'd have not been super surprised to run into a few modern vikings here, arms akimbo, toasting into the night. Alas, this remains modern day North Carolina, where the breweries don't work the wee hours and where vikings aren't often in line to tread: we sauntered in here for roughly the last thirty minutes of open they had going down, and that was that. It's worth mentioning that the OMB offerings are pretty terrific by many microbrew standards, and I sipped my way through a couple of different sizes in the brief time we had. Definitely worth a gulp if you find yourself nearby.\n",
      "David and I visited the Olde Mecklenburt Brewery last night for the first time to attend the Brewer's Ball benefiting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. We enjoyed the Copper and Mecktoberfest. We'll definitely be back to check it out again!\n",
      "Love this place and love the fact they do event. They have parties and you can have your party there. Love the fact you can take some beer home and put it in the frig. Beers you just cant get in the store. Look forward to seeing the new place\n",
      "I stopped in whiile traveling thru because I had heard good things about the beer. I had their lightest beer, which seemed to have a bitter taste, but after my second glass it started to taste better. I ordered a braut, it wasn't good. The roll was cold and tasted stale. The braut looked like it had been heated in a microwave, no grill or stove marks and it had a after taste. My advise is to stick with the beer. My partner had the Copper and seemed to really enjoy it. Again, after the second glass. I guess this stuff has to grow on you.\n",
      "I decided this would be a great way to spend a friend's birthday. I went on a Saturday and they have free brewery tours at 2pm, 3pm and 4pm. The information that was shared was interesting and the brewer conducting the tour was funny! It was HOT AS HELL in the brewery (Not in the tasting room, don't worry!) but the tour was only 15-ish minutes long. The food available is your typical bar pretzels and a couple more snacks. I think OMB is great for get-togethers or just for date night!\n",
      "Good not great. I enjoyed the beers I had here but I didn't really care for the place. It's an unique setup. High ceilings, big long tables where you sit down with strangers to eat and drink (which ended up being a lot of fun). The bar is HUGE but there are no stools. I was told that's the \"european style\" - you stand at the bar. Weird. Guess my American-centric brain just can't get wrapped around how that would be fun.... They have a good location and a good variety of beers, too. The prices aren't incredible - $5-6 for a pint - but that's ok. If you're up for some good beer and making new friends, this is the place.\n",
      "Great TRUE German style beers done right - FRESH! Made with care by a small team at OMB, the tap room has a great German feel to it and a comfort to it that makes it an ideal place for a few beers after work. No need to worry about parking, they've got a huge lot and there's no traffic or hassle getting there since it's right on Old Pineville Rd near Woodlawn! Tours of the brewhouse are free on Saturday @ 2, 3 and 4pm - definitely worth a check out if you're even mildly interested in the world's greatest beverage!\n",
      "German style beer hall and German style brewing. That nicely sums up OMB. OMB makes several tasty varieties of german beers following the reinheitsgebot german purity laws. Though they are good at making the beers they make, their downfall will be sticking to the reinheitsgebot. Because they follow that, they have a small selection of beer compared to most micro breweries. That is disappointing because I believe they could have a pretty good lineup of beer if they expanded and only brewed their traditional german beers using the purity law. I also took the tour while I was there and it was informative and entertaining. I tend to travel the world on brewery at a time and am becoming a tour snob. This one does not disappoint. They cover everything a good tour should cover, you get to enjoy beer while on the tour (though it is beer you buy from the beer garden) and the tour guide was entertaining.\n",
      "My owner organized a little brew crawl on July 3rd for me and some friends. Dogs are allowed in the biergarten. The only problem is the biergarten has no 'garten'! It's really just a concrete spot next to the parking lot with some picnic tables. : ( The beer is fantastic, as are the various 'meats in casing' that they sell. The pretzels could be awesome except they always seem to spend too much time in the microwave before making their way to the plate. Even with umbrellas, it was way too hot for someone with tender paws and no shoes. My owners were sweating up a storm (there are times i wish I could sweat, but alas I can only pant to cool off.) We'll definitely go back, but only in another season!\n",
      "I have to say that I'm agreeing more and more with the people who say that OMB should stick to the purity laws for their staple beers and offer more of a variety of other beers. The reason the purity laws began in the first place was so that brewers wouldn't add a whole bunch of filler and cheap ingredients to their beer. Now, when microbreweries add stuff to a beer, it's for flavor, not filler. I know most of the local breweries get along well, but people are almost always going to go where there are more choices. I'm not necessarily inclined to always go back to OMB for the same 3-5 beers I've already had. I say they should offer their \"pure\" beers and start experimenting with others.\n",
      "Excellent Beer now available to Charlotte residents! Ask for it on tap at your favorite bars and restaurants. From the brewery's website: \"The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery (OMB) is now brewing and delivering premium quality, thoroughly refreshing German style beer right here in Charlotte. Look for us at your local establishment.\"\n",
      "Love this place. Real ale!!!! Great beer and friendly service. A great way to spend an afternoon!\n",
      "Came here after work in early February to meet up with the mouse for a quick beer and bite before our alumni board meeting held there later that evening. Don't you wish all meeting were held at breweries? Anyways, we tried the four brats special. I liked how it was served up on disposal dish ware with plastic utensils. I really do - matches the feel of the place. Food is secondary to beer! The brats all tasted pretty good, but enjoyed the Kielbasa with spicy mustard. I wish the bartender-server keyed us into some options, if any, that come with the brats - would've loved some kraut or extra fixings. Maybe that's now how brats are served, but with the overload of just brats, probably could've cooked me up as the next brat that's how purely stuffed I was after that. (There was some bread, but mouse always takes my bread). Also, they need to fix one of the rickety benches - when one board member shifted, we all shifted. Drinking beer required careful balance - that doesn't go well together, obv. Definitely coming back here though as Copper is my favorite beer... of all time! Need to take a tour and find out how its made. dmo out\n",
      "I had HIGH hopes for the OMB in its new location. I've enjoyed coming to OMB to participate in Yoga on Tap and always enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe at the old location. However, I visited the new location over Labor Day weekend and didn't experience the same treatment as I did at the old location. The layout is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean, the grass is green, but the service is TERRIBLE. I was sitting inside with about 6 other people. It took 15 minutes to get someone even to notice that we were sitting there (the place wasn't even that crowded). After asking 3 people if could get some help, a very pleasant woman came by and helped us. We all ordered flights (4 smaller beers that give you the opportunity to taste a variety). When the beers finally arrived a different server brought them....totally fine, but she didn't know who ordered what and she didn't even know what beers were in each flight. So none of us even got what we had ordered. Then we ordered food and all of our orders were wrong. I was very disappointed and a little embarassed since I brought friends there from out of town. My advice to you --- save yourself some time and head over to Triple C, NoDa Brewery or any other lovely brewery Charlotte has to offer. I'll give OMB a few months to smooth out those kinks before returning back.\n",
      "After living in Germany for three years sometimes I'm in the mood for a beer garden. This place is pretty close. Good biergarten food and great beer! Check hours before you go because they're not open every day!\n",
      "OMB, I've been raving about your beers ever since I found them at some of the local stores and restaurants. Tonight I was able to experience them at your brewery. This brewery is literally on my way home from work so it was quite convenient to stop Friday after work. On draft today was Copper, Capt Jack and Mecktoberfest, all of which I have tasted before, Copper reminds me of Yuengling...not as much body, but still a very good beer. Capt Jack is ok but like someone at my table said, it can be a little bitter. Now Mecktoberfest....I could bathe in this beer. It is definitely my favorite fall brew - so much flavor and so smooth. I can definitely see myself stopping here regularly on the way home from work. Just a note to the reviewer who gave poor ratings on the food, this is a brewery. You come here for the beer, not the food. Most small independent breweries don't give you the food option.\n",
      "Had appetizers from here it was basic simple finger food and not too bad. I dont remember exactly the name of it but thr tuna with pita bread was good & so was the hummus. Boyfriend had the copper beer amd he loved it and recommends it.\n",
      "I've been to OMB a few times now for different events, most recently the Brewer's Ball & Christmas Market. While I'm not a big beer person ( If I was I think I would be in beer heaven ) If I was. It may take you a little while to find this spot, since it's down an odd street in Charlotte. I have to give it to this place and their marketing team for always having interesting and community/ local events. What a huge selection of beer! You can even keep refilling you own beer jugs, how clever and environmentally friendly! I'll have to spot by during the summer months to catch some live music.\n",
      "Olde Mack is the big brother of the Charlotte microbreweries and it shows. They have a big operation, which lacks some of the home-town-ey-ness of some of its neighbors. The beer lineup is very german, so you won't find a ton of west coast IPAs and the like. The food lineup is similarly german; the sausages didn't have much pizzaz to them, but the soft pretzels were amazing.\n",
      "Awesome German beer hall atmosphere, and great German beers!! This place is great, definitely worth stopping by and having a beer or three.\n",
      "I'm not sure how I missed out on this before I left to the UK. And I've been back for a year and still managed to not find time to get here. So when an out of town friend wanted to meet for a beer, I suggested we give this spot a whirl. We were not disappointed. He had the OMB Copper and the Dunkel. I stuck with the Captain Jack (a pilsner) and had two of those. Really tasty and with a good sharp flavor. I could drink bunches of 'em. We sat inside so we could talk, but outside there was a live band. They also have food - sausages and other German haus food - but he wanted some of our great BBQ so after the brews, we headed elsewhere. Five beers for under $20 plus tip - a pretty good deal. Factoid: Captain James Jack was one of the signatories of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, which predates the US Declaration of Independence by a year. He was also one of the representatives from our area to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. What a journey that must have been - no airport, no highways. It's over 500 miles and that's with I-85 and I-95. Wow! I'll definitely be back to OMB! Hooray for Charlotte and all these great breweries that we're getting!\n",
      "Probably one of the best tap house brew joints in town if you like their beer. There in lies my problem. Just not a fan of the beer they brew. I feel like I'm not the norm based on the popularity of this place but they have also been doing a marketing job unlike any of the other micro/craft brew houses. Bar area is nice and clean, lacking a little on TV's but not lacking in service. I'm sure given the nice large room they can cater to some pretty large groups.\n",
      "This place is awesome. I think it's a great place to take people who are in from out of town because I believe it represents the spirit of what the new Charlotte is all about. By that I mean that these guys are smart, entrepreneurial and not pretentious. The food They hand out free pretzel sticks, they aren't home made or even spectacular but they are a very important part of the experience. I also had a brat worst on a bun and it was fantastic. Sure I could have done it at home but for 4 bucks!? And free pretzels? Add that to the beer and I was a happy camper. The beer: they had 3 types on tap the Dunkel, the copper and a seasonal. All were tasty fresh and cold. The tour: Our guide was knowledgeable both about brewing and about the business it was really cool to hear the story about how they started and what the growth plans are. He was enjoying the beer with us as we walked so it felt just like visiting a friend at his or her business. The place: The area to have a beer isn't much to look at but it works. Outside is a fire pit which was really cool although the day we went it was too cold even for that. I hope to go again here in the spring and enjoy that part of the experience. Over all I just wish it was open more than it is as I work around the corner and would love to enjoy a brew after a hard day at the office.\n",
      "Was pleasantly surprised about this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is a warm, cozy, family style haven. The beer is delicious and the food surprisingly not just a great compliment, but delicious on its own. Overall, it feels very German. The only reason I'm not giving them all 5 stars is the waitstaff. They are great with beer knowledge, but have a tendency to be inattentive and disappear for long periods.\n",
      "This is the home some of the best craft beer in Charlotte. At Olde Meck, it is obvious that the focus is on quality as it is evident in every brew. You won't find more than 4 or 5 beers on draft but they are all tasty. Each one is served in the appropriate drinking vessel for that variety of beer. \"Copper\" is the signature beer and you'll find it not only here but also at many bars around town. The atmosphere at the brewery is heavily influenced by German beer halls. While it does its best to be true to the German style, it's a bit bland if you ask me. I prefer the cozy and lively NoDa or Birdsong when it comes to the design. Of note, they are building a whole new location that should be opening soon. Very excited to see that! There are some food options including bratwurst and pretzels. They stay true to the German influence in the menu. The brats are really good, and the other food is pretty average. It is a plus that they are able to offer food, as some other local breweries are not. They offer free tours throughout the day, which is a really nice touch as well. There are also lots of events that take place at the brewery which really brings out the community in full force! Bottom line, Olde Meck is the stalwart brewery in the QC!\n"

      "I enjoyed all the bier at OMB. Great German style heritage brews. The food was good but no there's a no non-sense take on the service with paper plates & plastic cutlery. Little disappointed they didn't have soft pretzels, they were out of stock, on a early Saturday evening... The one non-beer drinking guest in our party was also disappointed she was never offered the chance to have a glass of wine,which is available. We'll give it a second chance when it's convienient and\n",
      "Oh. Wow, there's breweries in Charlotte. Who knew?! Well, this was my first time here and was I surprised. When we first got here I noticed the nice wood fire they had going out in the front, but sadly we could not enjoy it because there was a lot of wind and smoke flying all over the place. Going inside there was a lot of flags hanging down from the tall ceilings, which I really enjoyed, and in the back stood the brewery itself. I got a couple of drinks and sat down with my friends. During the middle of our discussion someone came up and asked us if we wanted to go on a tour of the brewery. Awesome. So inside we got to see how they produce their beer and what their company stands for. \"Freshness\" and they honor this by saying that they only deliver their beer only 30 miles away from their brewery. So, according to them they don't like to put preservatives in their beer and that they go by that beer has an expiration date. In conclusion, the main points are these, they like fresh, only 30 miles of the brewery, and that's about it. So, this beer is exclusive to Charlotte. In conclusion, my trip was okay. It wasn't amazing, however I did enjoy some of the beer I got the chance to drink from there and the vibe and I'll definitely come back for a hangout with my friends.\n",
      "Everything about this joint was just ok. There is a very limited menu consisting of appetizers, and a variety of both sandwiches and brautwurts (that's it). I tired the wurst sampler and each of the sausages were rather bland, only one had some real flavor. The beer is what this place is supposed to be about but I found both beers I had to not be very good. I came in OMB looking for a burger a beer and to watch the game, with only one TV I only got one of those things. Def wouldn't run back there for anything.\n",
      "Great beer, good atmosphere, and friendly staff. Went there to attend a brewery tour, and was blown away by the quality and taste of thier beers. Nice place with an authentic German feel. No food served on a regular basis, although they do have a vendor come in sometimes to sell bratwurst and the like. The service is good, the waitresses are quite attentive on making sure you don't run out of beer. They have tours on Saturdays, which are interesting and informative. Kind of a small brewery right now, but well laid out and kept in order. Unfortunately, they only have two year round beers on tap, a Kolsch/Pilsner hybrid and an Altbeer. And only one seasonal at a time; at this time it was the summer seasonal. They haven't done any one offs or specialty beers to help fill out the tap list. It really is a nice place that is comfortable to hang out with some friends and have a few beers. The only complaint that I would have is the fact that there are only three beers on thier tap list at any given time, it would be nice to see at least four or five.\n",
      "Great beer and pretty good food, but the service is seriously lacking (might just be the two particular waitresses we had). We were expecting a much more interesting environment. Was full of drunk hipsters, which is funny too, but honestly, it was pretty boring. Not a real party environment or anything. Oh yeah, they close at ten.\n",
      "This is a five star establishment. Every experience with this team has been super positive. I stopped in today to have hanging hardware added to one of my mirrors. I arrived without an appointment, Cammie helped me unload the mirror from my car, completed the work while I waited (even though I didn't have an appointment), and helped me get the mirror back in my car. They are the friendliest bunch, both in person and on the phone, and spent all the time I needed to be comfortable in my decision. They answered my questions, even those that may have felt silly. I will definitely be using them again for all of my framing needs. In fact, they had a couple of other mirrors which I am considering stopping back and buying for the house. Quality team, quality work, friendly and knowledgable to engage with. A+\n",
      "I came here a few weeks ago to look for frames for a few paintings that need them. The guy behind the counter was one of the nicest and most helpful employees I've run across in a long time. It's refreshing to run into people who love what they do and are good at it. Props to him. I settled on a frame that only cost $40, but looked it would normally run over $100 due to its high quality. I was happy about this because I never like having to buy a frame that costs more than what I paid for the picture itself.\n",
      "Excellent employees who are extremely helpful and attentive. They did a great job assisting in picking out the best frame. Their finished product was spectacular.\n",
      "I took on painting as a hobby was looking for nice frames for them and I ended up at this place and they have a great variety and even put the wire on it for me.\n",
      "Can't complain here just sold my second work of art here for $300. They were open, serviceable, and punctual.\n",
      "I've been to this store at least 5 times now and I'll keep coming back for any framing needs. They are always very friendly and available to help. The orders always come in quickly, typically within 1-2 weeks. Once a frame came in damaged, they called me right away to let me know there would be a delay because they had to reorder. They took care of everything with no hassle and it turned out great. A+ for these guys!\n",
      "Was on a super tight deadline and the guys at Hall of Frames not only accommodated, they gave me advice on where to get the other stuff I needed. Fair price (and happier to pay it because it's family owned and not a HUGE corp), but I'd probably pay even more if I knew that was the kind of quality and help I would get every time. Came in on a Sunday around 1pm, had to do two other things in the framing/engraving/printing process and they had it done beautifully by 4pm.\n",
      "After a lot of internet searches and a couple visits to box frame stores, I settled on Hall Of Frames. The customer service was awesome Cammie has 27 years of experience and also is the manager of this long time family business. All the framing is done in house. Some chain frame shops send the orders out to a central location for the work. Cammje spent time and together we came up with my Million Dollar framed piece.\n",
      "I bought a used Dell desktop from him over a year ago. Thank god I know how to repair computers. I had to replace alot of the parts during that time. -One of the DDR ram chips went bad. PC would not boot -CMOS Battery went dead. BIOS would loose the time and settings -Internal SD Card reader went bad. I had another one handy -DVD burner had to be replaced. It would hang on burning disks.. Now I find out that one of the sata ports is bad on the motherboard. Having to use another port instead.. His prices are also very high.\n",
      "They wanted $50 plus tax for a DVD burner. Ordered the same part from newegg.com for $12.99 tax and freight included. I don't mind paying an upcharge for local service but I do mind being taken advantage of. The person at the counter also had a nasty attitude. Never will go there again.\n",
      "Very good service here. Quickly diagnosed the problem, found a solution and had me back up and running in 24 hours. Professional and courteous, I highly recommend!\n",
      "By far my favorite Pizza ever. Just had it again last night and it was great. Called ahead and picked it up. You guys rock pizza. Can't wait to try the new location...that has a different menu. I've taken many people to try your pizza and they all agree that it's the Best.\n",
      "Well sadly I have been forced to change my view of Spinato's. April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends. In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet. On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol. I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists. Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant. What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did. Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out. I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes. I think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists. Or is your establishment so unsafe I should arm myself next time I come? Unfortunately, I won't ever take the chance again. I DEFINITELY will miss you... (I changed my rating from 5 to 3...the food I give a 5, the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise).\n",
      "This is the best pizza in Phoenix. I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times. Their canolies are amazing too. They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead. I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too.\n",
      "Neighborhood pizzaria right across from my other favorite, Pat's Pizza. Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy. The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side. In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak. But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?\n",
      "REALLY Good! It's so good, it makes good look not so good! I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). The spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool.\n",
      "Great Pizza. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The sauce is what makes these pies extra special. It actually nice and sweet! That is what makes this place so delicious. Be sure to go there on Tuesday for the Beer specials. They have Peroni & Stella on tap. Yum!\n",
      "How is it that I've lived in Phoenix for 19 years and I've never been to Spinato's? This place is fabulous! Upon arrival there was a short wait but definitely worth it. We started off with the garlic bread as an appetizer. It was THE best...an explosion of flavors in your mouth! If you don't try it, you're missing out. We decided on a 14\" thin crust pizza. Menu claims it feeds 2-3 people. We were a party of two so I figured this would be adequate. We ended up taking the majority of the pizza home because there was a lot left over. Ummm, leftovers! Next time we'll opt for a smaller size. The service was impeccable. Brittany, our server, was beyond cordial. She checked on us at least five times to make sure our needs were met. Overall, best pizza I've had in Phoenix. Better than Pizzeria Bianco (in my opinion) and you don't have to deal with the average three hour wait. Prices are fair. For the appetizer, 14\" pizza and two drinks, it was only $23. We'll be back!\n",
      "I recently revisited Spinato's with my parents and brother's family. Though I thought their pizza was really good I was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was. I could have just eaten that with a little salad and have been very happy. The portions were generous. I saw one of the calzones and WOW...it was huge! I really want to go back for one (seriously, you have to see it. It looks like someone folded a pizza over a ham). Overall, very warm and inviting people. Good food.\n",
      "I'm giving them a 5 just for their spaghetti and meatball calzone. It sounds awful, but it is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Must try!!\n",
      "Some of the best pizza in town. Owners are friendly and ALWAYS get our order right. We usually get the \"Other Signature\" and it is delicious! This place is justifiably popular, so if you are in a hurry, consider ordering take-out, otherwise plan for a wait.\n",
      "First visit...Very busy; but worth the wait to get a table...First of all; like the selection of \"discontinued\" wine and beer; didn't try - but great concept. Had the pizza; my roommate had the calzone. Both items were hot out of the oven; tasted excellent. Service was great. Will definately be back again!!!\n",
      "This place has the best gluten-free pizza in town. Even if you aren't gluten free if you like thin crust, you will love Spinato's gluten-free pizza. I got it to go so can't speak to the restaurant ambiance, but staff were very pleasant. I'll definitely be going back.\n",
      "Our family always enjoys a night a spinatos. We always request Lorenzo as our server.\n",
      "Can't get enough of Spinato's pepperoni and sausage pizza. The combination of the sweet sauce and cheese blend makes for the perfect pizza.\n",
      "YES!!! I am really impressed with this place. Three of us arrived on a Friday night and had a 30 minute wait. We were all exhausted and starving, but we couldn't wait to try a new place. We had a beer while we waited and were seated on time. The place is cozy, and the staff is super friendly. We started with the cheesy garlic bread. My friends were not excited until they tried it. Oh WOW, it's bursting with flavor. That cheese, that sauce, that garlic, that crunch. Oh. SO. GOOD. Then we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch). All I can say is: EAT HERE, thank me later.\n",
      "mama spinato's garlic pizza is awesome, the salad is always fresh too - best to eat there -\n",
      "From start to finish: Answering the phone was Elena, who was friendly and attentive. I ordered two pizzas and she told me delivery would take 45-60 minutes ( and I am 4 miles away). It took 35 min. I ordered the thin crust Signature Spinach, and Super Six (meat & vegetable), and they are a tasty balance of flavors, and it smells great. I hope you are within range of them for delivery because you will never order from a major chain again.\n",
      "Wow, the \"mamma's spinach\" pizza was really good! Garlic, spinach, & fresh tomatoes was great, even 2 days later.\n",
      "My whole family went here last night for my oldest brother's birthday. This restaurant was very accommodating to our large party. They even sat us before everyone was there, and we appreciated that. We ordered a bunch of food, a couple pizzas, a couple sandwiches, bruschetta, salad, ravioli, meatballs.... a lot of food. Their pizza is always good and my brother swears that this location is the best and has the best crust of all the locations. I thought the pizza was good, the italian salad dressing was very good, and the ravioli and meatballs were tasty. I thought the bruschetta was just ok... but overall, this place is very good. I would recommend it to anyone for some classic italian food, plus about 10 of us ate for 100$....pretty good deal.\n",
      "After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch. I had a small pep and cheese, which was the perfect lunch size btw. I have to admit that this crust was nothing short of amazing. They were not shy with the toppings either, which made it even more amazing because cheese makes everything awesome. I even found myself thinking about the crust after I left, and the next day as well. I am not sure what they put in that pizza but I am addicted. It would be dangerous if I lived close.... I will definitely be back.\n",
      "Love love LOVEE Spinato's. Their red sauce is to die for, perfectly sweet and tangy! Calzones are fabulous as well, especially the spinach, garlic & tomato one. Wards off hoardes of vampires, I'm sure. Warning - these don't reheat well. Plan on eating it all fresh. Normally multi-meat pizzas make me want to ralph from greasiness, but their \"Get Meaty\" is really good, the sausage (I think?!) has a nice smokey flavor that goes well with the sweet sauce. I go to the location in Tempe, but I believe they make their food in one place, so you shouldn't get much of a difference as far as quality goes.\n",
      "I just visited their new location at 7th Street and Missouri. The baked spaghetti calzone (with meatballs and ricotta cheese) put me into a wonderful afternoon food coma. The personal size is more than enough for a filling lunch, but you need to get the regular size if you want to take some leftovers home. They have such amazing food and they have a beautiful new building now too!\n",
      "Best pizza in town!!! \"...so good, you'll jump up and slap the person sitting next to you...\" This location has moved to the corner of Missouri & 7th St; talk about making a good thing better.\n",
      "North Central Phoenix is home to some great pizzarias. The 12th Street corridor has Stumpy's, Isa's pizza now anchors the northern gates of Sunnyslope.....and Spinato's is on the southern edge of the 'Slope. Great pizza, though I am not a fan of the \"Mama's signature\" (sauce is too sweet for my taste), I like their \"Get Meaty\" pie and the \"spicy italian\". Salads are good. They have a wine special on Wednesday's that's pretty sweet (50% off on bottles, I beleive).\n",
      "My favorite pizza joint in the PHX metro area!\n",
      "I love Spinato's pizza. I usually get a gluten free Get Meaty. The gluten free crust is better than any I've had. Their regular crust is, of course, delicious as we'll, but I have come to enjoy the gluten free crust even better than the regular. My family loves to go to Spinato's.\n",
      "HOLY SMOKES! I now have FOUR favorite Phoenix pizza places! With pizza I'm all about the sauce, and this is the shizz! Yeah it's sweet, like really sweet but I freakin' LOVE it! It's soooooooooo good that I don't even want a topping, just cheese and that fabulous sauce! This maybe my new favorite pizza but it's such a tough call. For the record ... the best in Phoenix (for me) ... in no particular order. Pizza A Metro (pepperoni) Spinato's (cheese) Cibo (Diavola which is the best topping I've ever had on a pizza) Pane Bianco All three just rock my world, man do I LOVE Spinato's!\n",
      "Pretty damn good. Recommended by our hotel's bartender, and you know that's good advice! Pizza toppings were fresh and tasty. Thin-ish crust, cooked to be a little crunchy with lightly browned cheese. Zesty, hearty homemade marinara sauce may be the X factor.\n",
      "Family owned and super fresh ingredients. Their pizza sauce is the best I've ever had. Their salads are great too. Even the delivery guys are the best. Love this place!\n",
      "After living here for three years, I have finally found delicious pizza. Great thin crust and good flavors throughout the pizza. This is the first pizza I have found in Phoenix that I actually want to go back and get some more of!\n",
      "HORRIBLE!! I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone! They should have known I was coming!!! The food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better! We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm. OK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! :( Now I have no more left :( Unfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*\n",
      "After about 5 failed attempts at finding a pizza joint worth the money we were invited to Spinato's. The only thing negative I have to say is that our service was not great. The watier seemed way \"too cool\" for his job. My daughter never got her meatballs. When she finally did, 20 minutes after the pizza, they were free. But still, she was hungry. The service didn't take away from the fact that the pizza was SOOOO cheesey and delicisous. I love the cross cutting style. I can't decribe it any other way than utter cheesy goodness. If you love your pizza cheesy and gooey and messy..this is the place for you. If you are in the mood for whole wheat, less cheese and health pizza...find somewhere else!\n",
      "This place has really good thick and thin crust pizza. I've never been a fan of thin crust because of it being so crispy and it just wasn't good to me. However, the thin crust pizza here is quite good. I would order it again. It's really small inside the restaurant, so I would recommend ordering it to go.\n",
      "***Moving to 5509 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85014*** This location is closing at the end of November 2013 to a new location on 7th St and Missouri. They will offer some great new menu items, as well as introducing a café/marketplace/bakery! --------------------------------------------------------------------- From article at http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/11/spinatos_pizzeria_pizza_central_phoenix_restaurant_new.php The family-owned local chain that's been making old-school Chicago-style pies in the Valley just shy of 40 years has announced their newest location, a 10,000-square-foot space at 5509 North 7th Street in Central Phoenix (7th Street and Missouri), will officially open Monday, November 25.\n",
      "GREAT pizza place! The thin crust pizza is AMAZING! I ordered take out for the first time and everything was absolutely perfect. The dining room seemed to be fairly busy, but that is to be expected for a Saturday night.\n",
      "Again, Yelp*, why no 1/2 stars. I'm not giving five but this was better than four. Terrific pizza, I ordered it without mentioning, \"don't cut it\"; you know they like to do the cross-cut here. She told me it would be about 25 minutes. Well, I called back after 14 minutes and she said she'd tell them not to cut the pizza, but when I got there, it had already been cut. I have to tell you, this young woman apologized at least 4 times and offered to re-cook the pie at least that many times. It was my mistake, they were faster than expected, didn't want them to re-cook the pizza. She should have apologized and offered to re-cook...and she did. Pizza was great, of course and next time I'll remember to ask for no-cut. In the meantime, this is a good spot. Go there!\n",
      "Eh. Placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight. The confirmation said it would be 75 minutes, which wasn't unreasonable because the NBA Finals were on TV. It actually took 90 minutes and the pizza was barely warm, and definitely not hot. I had to put it in the oven. Ordered the Combo pizza. The Italian sausage was good, the peppers were ok, but the mushrooms were canned. Gross. The sauce was also way too sweet. Definitely not my favorite pizza and I won't be ordering from there again, especially when a large pizza is $20. If you charge that much for a pizza it better show up hot and it better be good.\n",
      "I really like the pizza. We ordered the 7\" personal size custom toppings ! The red sauce was the best I have ever had. On the sweeter side but amazing . Crust was perfect fairly thin and crispy . I loved it.\n",
      "They get 5-stars because they have gluten-free pizza!! I usually get their Mamma Spinato's signature pizza. It's wonderful! Like nothing I have ever tasted before. Their wait staff is always good and very efficient. It's always crowded so try not to go at peak times.\n",
      "This is more a 2.5 stars restaurant ... May be after reading all these reviews have hyped up my expectation of this restaurant. Ordered the signature Mama's pizza, meat ball and spaghetti and the cheese ravioli and was disappointed in all of them. The crust of the pizza yes is thin but soggy when ordered extra crispy :-| .... and the sause is definitely not from fresh tomatoes ... and over salted Meatball and spaghetti and the ravioli is slight better than what I can get from the frozen aisle in the supermarket .... ain't meeting the hype for sure. Interior is very Chicago-ish, Service was good but it took them sometime to open the tomato can ...\n",
      "I really had to take time and taste this pizza and some how the thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom was very salty either due to the sausage or pepperoni but either way its not the quality of items that I am use to in a pizza, a little history about myself I was raised in a family of catering I really get into the taste of food, the tomato sauce I really did not get that feeling on my taste buds of oh that's good, and by the way when a pizza place starts using a dough press instead of kneading the dough themselves looses 2 stars off the the top, you cannot replace kneading and a rolling pin . I have made pizza's before and i make my own sauce and use quality ingredients once you do it yourself for a while then you can really sharpen your taste buds for quality pizza. I have to say CIBO has a better pizza, and Grimaldi's due to the fact that the dough, tomato sauce is much better quality. \"The Gastro\"\n",
      "I love Spinato's! Recently my husband and I planned a dinner out. When circumstances required a shift in the plan we chose Spinato's because we did not want to be disappointed. And of course we were not. The food was great and our server was very friendly. They offer a gluten free crust, which works well with their sauce!\n",
      "I give this restaurant 5 stars not because it's a 5 star restaurant, but because their pizza and service are both amazing. This thin crust Chicago style pizza is almost identical to the Aurelios pizza I grew up on in the south suburbs of Chicago. It's pizza perfection. The brownie dessert is to die for. We didn't try to calzone but saw lots of other customers who ordered them.\n",
      "Some primo eats... period. Me likes the beer specials I've happened upon there. If you want to know what a moron is, scroll down and read a low rating for this place... because there is no way to not dig on this killer grub.\n",
      "Ben here a few times for lunch. Its in a tiny strip mall, and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here, and you have to remember to control yourself :)\n",
      "Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza It's the only thing I've ever ordered there And it alone warrants 5 stars.\n",
      "one of the best thin crust pizza places in the phoenix area and the price is right too: a) The Super Six has the right flavors and a lil sweet. b) The cheese with mushroom is always a favorite with me.\n",
      "I've got bad news for you. One day, you're gonna' die. I've also got good news for you. You're gonna wake up and be standing at the pearly gates. The bad news is that they're gonna' be closed. The good news is that they more than likely are going to swing wide for you and a choir of heavenly angels will sing as you walk through. The bad news is that your Aunt Agnes, who used to like to pinch the crap out of your cheek until she kicked the bucket will be there to greet you. The good news is that she's going to hand you a box that says \"Spinato's\" on it. You open the box. If it's empty, you're in hell. But more than likely, it's got a piping hot, fresh-made a Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinash pie. Your piehole will be dripping, and as you lift a piece to your lips, even Aunt Agnes's pinching of your cheek will seem like a blessing. Yeah, it's that good. If they serve pizza in heaven, it's Mamma Spinato's. The good news is you don't have to croak to enjoy it. And they deliver. And it's hot! Manga! Quick notes: Their \"medium\" is everyone else's large. I did not see their large, but I bet it's manly indeed. Extra star for square cutting the pie. Spinato's is what pizza is ALL about.\n",
      "Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's.\n",
      "Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know. One of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring. This was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks. Ken and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home. The menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own) and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!! I have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.\n",
      "So the parental units call me up on Sunday and ask me if I want to meet them at this place they love called Spinato's. The catch, I have to meet them in a 1/2 hour coming from Scottsdale. Normally this wouldn't be a big issue, but I took lounging to a whole new level on Sunday, and I was looking pretty bedraggled. I quickly looked up Spinato's on Yelp, since my parents have been known to be hit or miss on some eateries. All great reviews, which made me really want to try it. The lure of a free dinner, (and seeing my mom) put my unshowered butt in gear! So I hopped in the car 15 minutes later looking slightly scary. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear a hat inside the restaurant, or I would have. Turns out it didn't really matter what I looked like anyway. At 5 PM on Sunday the crowd was right out of Cocoon, before they got in that pool! One lady even had her oxygen tank with her. I found myself wishing I could try it. I kept wondering if I breathed in that oxygen for a while, would I get some kind of wonderful, natural high??? The place was packed, and it turns out those geriatrics really know their stuff. The food was great! We did the whole dinner family style. The antipasto salad with spinach was amazingly perfect, really the best I've ever had. The garlic bread was deliciously, warm, garlicky, and crunchy all at once. The marinara sauce to dip it is was slightly sweet, but not in an obnoxious way. It was just the right counter balance to the garlic. The pizza itself was decent, not great, but decent. This is probably because I prefer thinner crust, and minimal cheese on the pizza, such as Grimaldi's, but that didn't keep me from eating it. It didn't keep me from having it for lunch the next day either! I will definitely be back for the antipasto salad with spinach & the garlic bread. I need to cut back on the pizza anyway. Oh, and the service was amazing. I don't even think we had one wait person. Anybody you asked for something immediately brought it to you! Seriously, nothing phased them. Love it, and hopefully I'll be back soon!\n",
      "The pie is pricey and sweet but you'll be back! Great mom-n-pop shop feel, good service, sometimes a long wait but you'll understand why.\n",
      "Our family comes from Chicago area, & we frequented Aurelio's- & were thrilled to find Spinato's here!! They now have 4 locations- their sauce is delicious- pizzas are thin crust, & you can order extra-crispy, if desired. This place is family owned, great people, & clean- a major thing I look for in a dining establishment! They also deliver (not sure if at all locations, tho). I have even called in to radio stations to tell others; but like the other poster(s), don't want to have to wait for 'my' table! Check them out if you like pizza!!!!! Best we've found in Phx!\n",
      "I've been to Spinatos a few times now. I've had the famous spinach, the Chicago, and the Super Six. All of their pizzas look delicious and are generous with the toppings. The first couple of slices were overwhelmingly sweet. Almost too sweet for my liking. That being said it kinda grew on me and before I knew it I ate almost half of the first pizza. I dont think Id ever order the spinach again but the Chicago and Super Six I would recommend. The prices are a bit high. ~20 bucks for a medium Super Six before tip is a bit much for a pizza in my book. Spinatos does not crack my top 5 in the Valley but I would definitely recommend you trying it if you are a general fan of pizza.\n",
      "I can't believe I am giving this place 5 stars but after two visits in one week, it is well worth it. After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. There are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. First visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. For the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the \"lil\" spinach calzone (7\" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two). Well done Spinato's, well done.\n",
      "A little background.... My husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of Chicago. My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. Fast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!\n",
      "I have never dined in here, so I can only speak about the food really. I have ordered carry out and delivery many times from this place and have never had a bad experience. Everything is always really fresh. When I have done carryout the employees were always nice and attentive. The delivery staff is always good as well. Delivery has taken up to an hour at times on lunch, so just be prepared. The food is still good, hot, and fresh when it arrives and is worth the wait. Sign up for their email coupons and you will have a pleasant surprise every year the week of your birthday. Bottom line, if I were to move from Phoenix and come back for a visit, my first food destination would be Spinato's for the Italian Beef Calzone.\n",
      "I love spinatos. They have my favorite pizza. Every time I am in phoenix, I make sure to stop by here. The spinach pizza is my favorite. I also like to get the family style half and half salad. i've been going there for years and it's always delicious!\n",
      "We had the thin crust pizza with sausage and ham, and it was very good. It was very, very greasy, though. Possibly the greasiest pizza I've ever had. Cut down on the grease factor and it would have been 5 stars.\n",
      "The food is good, but I just can't get into the sweetness of the pizza sauce. I will try it again, maybe a pizza without the red sauce. Bread was great, salad also great!\n",
      "Best Pizza in Phoenix...Period!! Sweet sauce. Crispy crust. Never have had a bad experience here and I have been here at least 10 times. Staff is always welcoming and polite. Also if you happen to have room at the end of your meal order the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.\n",
      "Best Pizza ever!! ingredients are fresh. you get quality pizza! For a good price!\"\n",
      "Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are explosive! When I order for take-out, even after only 10 minutes of a drive in my car, my car ends up smelling like the pizza for 2 full weeks! The antipasto wasn't much to write home about as the house Italian dressing wasn't very flavorful, but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING. I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good. Check this place out for eat in or for take-out. Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks.\n",
      "Visiting or live in Phoenix??? NEED TO GO HERE for Pizza!! MMMMmmmm\n",
      "I came here because I wanted some pizza and I was hungry. Settled on a salad and a margarita pizza. The salad was intimidating because it came in a bowl. The next thing that came was the margarita pizza. It arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most pizzas come on the tray it was cooked on sort of. Well at least the size of tray it was made on. You know the standard metal pizza pan. Instead the pizza came on a round rack on top of the pizza tray. Then while trying to grab a piece of pizza I thought it wasn't cut all the way though. It look a while to figure out the pizza wasn't cut traditionally. it was cut every which way. The pizza was good, but it doesn't compare to my favorite pizza place. Some of the pizza didn't have topping on it. it was odd too because there wasn't a lot of cheese on it. There also wasn't a lot of sauce. I liked the crust of the pizza because it was crunchy and not soggy. I think I'd try some other pizza if I did go back. It was good, but I'd try something else. There was gelato there. I ordered two scoops vanilla and then one scoop dark chocolate. The dark chocolate was good. The vanilla was a bit sweet for me.\n",
      "This is my FAVORITE place in Phoenix for pizza. I discovered Spinato's years ago when I still lived in Tempe/Mesa and my then-current girlfriend took me to their original Spinato's location on Smith, which is hidden away in an industrial park. Despite the obscure, hard-to-find location (even when you've been there before, it's very easy to drive right by it), this place is ALWAYS busy.There is nothing else around there to draw in business, at least not after all the industrial park offices close at 5pm. That is how good it is. I live in the Dreamy Draw area now and I get my Spinato's fix from their 12th St and Glendale location. My all time favorite is their sausage pizza. The cheese is very, very good. They make their own Italian sausage. There is something about the sauce OMG it is SO good, slightly sweet. As others wrote, this is Chicago thin-crust-style pizza, cut into squares. Oh, and the crust is so good too. I'm not gai for Chicago pizza but I just love Spinato's. Every single person - and I mean, EVERY SINGLE ONE - I have ever taken to Spinato's, they love it and they go back for more and introduce their friends to it. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Nello's gets lots of props in Phoenix but I promise you, Spinato's is better than Nello's.\n",
      "I ordered online for take out. I got the margherita pizza and a spinach calzone. The pizza had no sauce on it. None. Not like any margherita I've ever had. The calzone had way too much garlic and it was really sweet. Also, everything was incredibly oily. Yuck. It was almost inedible. Also, there's a problem with their online ordering system. I ordered the pizza under my name. I had to set up an account with a password and everything. No big deal. When I placed my order the only option to pay was immediately instead of also at the pizza shop. My husband gave me his credit card to pay with and I did so. Still this is all fine other than the pizza shop losing out on a tipping opportunity but, whatever, not my business. When we got to Spinato's my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me if it could be under a different name and I said no I just set up my account and we already paid, what's going on with our order? Then as we're trying to figure out what happened we started going over what we ordered and then a man appeared with the food. My name was right on it. I pointed out that there's my name printed right on the piece of paper that's with the food. Then the lady behind the counter got a little condescending with her tone as she told me that the order is under the name on the credit card. I kept my name so me and my husband have different names. Why didn't she say this in the first place? Why the condescending tone? She might work there and know how the system is set up but, as a first time customer how would I? Also, if the food is under credit card name and they require that you pay online immediately when you order then why do I need an account unless they want to spam me for ordering food from them? or sell my info for extra $$\n",
      "Yum! You usually couldn't get my husband to touch spinach but the Mama's Original gets him his greens. We discovered Spinatos at the Culinary Festival years ago and have been going back since. We love the fact that its a family-owned business and that all the teenage kids work the place. The food portions are generous, the restaurant has a great Italian pizza place feel and they send you coupons for your birthday! Can't beat that. I'd suggest for take-out or for a very casual meal out. Not a date night kind of place.\n",
      "One of the best 'za joints in the PHX. No corkage and BYOB so the pizza wont be the only thing that is deliciously sauced... cheesy... my pun not the pizza... well the pizza too. Both the thick crust and thin crust are amazing, i prefer the thin. Large sausage, onions, and shrooms with a few cheap bottles from Safeway across the street = a night of fun for all your friends. I have NO idea what people are hattin' on the 'nato's for, it is nearly perfect pizza. They also have great huge grilled sandwiches and fresh salads.\n",
      "This is the best pizza, by far, in my neighborhood. The pizza was awesome!!!!!! I will be going back Tomorrow for round 2.\n",
      "I love the thin crust classic signature. So does my mom. My husband thinks the sauce is too sweet...but his opinion doesn't really count. I tried the antipasto with the house italian. pretty decent salad for a pizza joint! We ordered online and picked it up...I am always a fan of not having to call and place an order. I have an aversion to talking on the phone. I have no idea why.\n",
      "When my husband and I moved out here, the first place his co-workers said we had to eat was Spinato's. His boss ordered it for lunch one day and my phone started blowing up with texts from my husband telling me he was bringing this home for dinner. He said simply - best pizza I've ever had. I was skeptical. Is it really that good? Was he just really hungry? NO! From the minute he walked in the door - the pizza grabbed my attention. From the smell to the look to the taste. Hands down - best pizza I've ever had. They don't deliver to our place, but it's well worth the trip down the 51 to pick it up. The staff is alway nice and will remember you after a few trips. All around - great food, great service and local.\n",
      "I have never dined in at Spinatos, however i get delivery or takeout quite often. I love their pizza, love the way they cut it and the taste is great. I have met the owner and he is a kind man with a loyal following of workers that love what they do. A+ food.\n",
      "This is a terrible place to try to take a large group. The food is mediocre at best. But they run the place poorly. We called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8. They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in. My wife went ahead and reserved the table. She was told it would be 45 minutes. She came home and we began getting the kids ready. We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away. We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated. Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably. We left, I will never go back. It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat. The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle. Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult.\n",
      "Horrible. Tastes exactly like store bought microwave pizza or cafeteria pizza to be exact. Really bad. Don't know why people like it. I think they've just never had good pizza. The sauce is really bad too. Tastes like chef Boyardee. Disgusting!!!\n",
      "So i went here after church with some friends. I can honestly say, yes Spinato's is good, BUT this one is not as good as the one on Bell. I really enjoy the pizza here. My one complaint is, the thick crust pizza is so generic tasting, it is a pizza hut reminiscent thick crust. which in my mind. Not a good thing. The thin crust is the way to go if you come to spinatos\n",
      "Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location. They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference. I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch. Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future. My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian. The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!\n",
      "I was born near Chicago, moved away by three and have never been back. So as an adult I have missed out on all the great cusine known from this midwest mecca of a city. This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago. I love the pizza here as well as the down to earth relaxing atmosphere. Servers have always been great to me. I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place. Until I take a vacation to the windy city, I'll have to come here to get my fill.\n",
      "It's been five days since I've returned from Bruce Kessler's Hot Yoga retreat and I'm still in bliss. The week-long journey in paradise will renew one from the inside and out, mentally and physically. The yoga, accommodations, and cuisine are top-notch and the epitome of a five star resort. There isn't a better way to start each day than a morning yoga class in a heated room, on a hillside with a panoramic view of the ocean on the Bay of Tenacatita. The room is heated perfectly to 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity. The yoga is comprised of 26 poses with two breathing exercises. It's suitable for beginners to advanced practitioners. Bruce is an amazing teacher as he is attentive to each guest, providing ongoing suggestions for improvement and positive feedback. You do a second class the same day in the afternoon. Doing two classes a day was quite challenging the first few days, but you'll get accustomed to it mid-week. I've seen immense further depth in my postures in a week of practicing with Bruce. Punta Serena is the resort where the retreat is held at. The ocean-side villas have spectacular views and you'll fall asleep each night with the sound of waves crashing in your front yard. The villas are clean with the grounds well-kept. There's plenty of fresh towels and spa-like amenities in the bathrooms. There's a private beach just steps down from the villas, an infinity pool (perfect for taking a dip in after each class), and two jacuzzis perched overlooking the Bay. And you get one free thirty minute massage during the week's stay. The food served at the on-site restaurant is a highlight of the retreat. You'll have access to The Buena Vista restaurant for breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks, and dinner. All meals are included with unlimited access to the open bar after 6pm. Bruce coordinates with the staff of the restaurant to provide a variety of juices and smoothies, along with 3-4 different types of salads with each meal for the retreat attendees to nosh on before ordering an entree. One surely gets pampered and fueled with the freshest greens, seafood, and meats. There wasn't a single meal I had which I wasn't satisfied with. I'd definitely return for another week at Hot Yoga Bliss Vacations. It's the most rewarding treat one can give themselves. My mind and body are still thanking me for it.\n",
      "I don't know where to begin... I've recently returned from an April 2015 retreat, feel amazing and am looking at my schedule to see when I can go back. The Yoga: The teaching was top notch, Bruce and Carrie were great and took my practice to the next level. I've been practicing regularly (3-6x week) for 6 years and I still learned a lot. Ongoing injuries improved more dramatically over 1 week than over years of yoga and 6 months of physical therapy. The room was perfect as far as heat & humidity and it was fantastic to practice with stunning views of the ocean. I wasn't trying to lose weight, ate 3 meals/ day (including a ton of guacamole which was very good at the resort!) and lost 5 lbs. The Resort: Pacific Coast Rustic Mexican Chic. The staff was warm and eager to please whether it was re-opening the office to get bug spray at 10PM or making special requests for food. You are given particularly special treatment being part of \"El Grupo de Bruce.\" I have Celiac and the manager of the resort sat down with me to go over the menu and see if there was anything that I needed not on the menu or outside of the resort. The Spa: The massages were amazing and incredibly reasonable, everyone on our group got more than 1. I highly recommend Rodrigo! The Price: The resort is truly all inclusive and an amazing value for the price. I barely used my wallet all week. I wouldn't call this a 5 star resort by US or continental standards but you definitely aren't paying for this either. You're getting 8 days of great yoga with star instructors, solid lodging and food in a beautiful setting for the price of ~3 nights at a boutique hotel. The resort is clean, beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. I recommend checking out trip advisor reviews on the resort (it gets a high rating) ... The linens/ towels/ mattresses/ etc are not posh and you won't mistake it for the 4 Seasons (although the staff is as warm and as eager to please). Recommendations: Eat lots of guacamole- it is amazing! Bring strong bug spray If you get sick, see the resort doctor. I admittedly get sick often when traveling to certain parts of the world and go with travel antibiotics. I was the only one from our group to get sick and after an uncomfortable night/ morning when the travel antibiotics weren't cutting it, the resort doctor gave me a shot that had me feeling better in 1 hour and back at the evening yoga class and dinner.\n",
      "Bruce's week long week at Puenta Serena exceeded all of my expectations! If you are considering going, it's 100% worth it! I have honestly never been more relaxed in my life! The resort was peaceful, clean, and the staff very hospitable. The rooms are spacious and each one had a private balcony with a hammock looking out onto the ocean. I personally enjoyed that it was adult only because it was quiet and relaxing. There is a secluded, nude beach (if you want), that is nice because it feels like you are by yourself on a beautiful ocean. The massages are great - plus 30 min came free with Bruce's yoga week! There are plenty of activities you can sign up for if you want... at first I thought I would do this since I'm so active, but, like I said, I became so relaxed I didn't need to do anything extra. Bruce's yoga instruction felt like I was getting 1-1 training everyday. The classes were challenging and fun. Our little group all used each other's energy and became much stronger yogi's by the end of the week. Sign up - it's worth it!!!\n",
      "I joined Bruce for a Hot Yoga Bliss retreat and vacation in December 2014. The Punta Serena Resort where the retreat was held had everything you could ask for - a beautiful infinity pool, two hot tubs perched next the ocean, amazing views and healthy, delicious food. It was the perfect location for a blissful getaway to unwind and relax. But don't get me wrong, it was a lot of hard work to practice two ninety minute classes a day working on breathing, postures, form and endurance. The yoga room was equipped with plenty of heat, mats, towels and water. In addition to an amazing view of the ocean, there was always fresh fruit and juice waiting for us after class. We were treated to healthy, delicious meals throughout the day, and although we had the option of eating at other places, we decided to eat mostly at the resort because it was so good and the staff knew what each of us liked and were really sweet about accommodating our requests. I can't say enough good things about the retreat; but the kind, hard-working staff is what truly stood out for me. Everyone from the massage therapists to the chefs to the servers were angels - and Jose, our concierge hooked us up with anything we needed. So, the one suggestion I have for someone going to Bliss would be to bring plenty of cash for tipping, laundry (available on site!) shopping and more!\n",
      "a beautiful, blissful, experience. it's all just perfect - from the views of the ocean from every room, to the classes overlooking the bay, to the level of teaching, to the green drinks. my favorite part of the experience was diving into the ocean after class. the beach is natural with no development on it except for a little tiki bar for food and refreshments. i can't say enough about this retreat.\n",
      "This place was very good before, but not anymore. They started doing $5 express takeout and $3 breakfast and last week they changed menu (not reflected on website yet). The original menu was good and food was great, but now they dropped the price by quite a lot (for example risotto from ~$25 to ~$15). I think this place has shifted to a cheap mediocre shop. Even though this place is no longer a nice dining choice of mine, I will try their express takeout just out of curiosity.\n",
      "My boyfriend got a good deal online for a 4 course meal for this resturant. I have no idea whether they were under staff or not but that shouldnt be the issue, they couldve let us know for a heads up and not make us wait for each meal. My first experience at vino rosso was horrible and this was on Valentine's day. Dont get me wrong, the food was great but the SERVICE was hell. They questioned us back if we wanted water when we clearly wanted water and they shouldve given water when we first sat down, i think that is proper service 101 for any resturant. Literally took them 20-30 minutes for each dish to come out. Whole experience was feeling agitated and anxious. And the last course which was dessert, the order that came out for me was wrong and didnt even take it back and my boyfriend and i wanted was get the bill and leave asap by than, so thats what happened, asked for the bill when dessert came, stuffed it down asap and left. The customers to the right wasnt too happy either about their service, when they sat down, they waited probably about 20 minute to take their order and they had to get the waiter'waitress attention. By the end, we told ourselve that we wouldve rather stayed in and order take out and not have dealt with the experience and expecially how cold it was outside.\n",
      "A group of co-workers decided to go here for summerlicious, first of all, summerlicious is an opportunity for restaurants to put out there their best food so you want to come back and pay regular price for it....well this place completely missed the mark on that. The menu sounded appetizing but it began with the server bringing water to the table and proceeding to ask us for our food orders, that's all fine but then she didn't even ask if anyone wanted a drink (other than the water). Once our food came out it was a disappointment after disappointment, some food was cold, tasted like it had been re-heated and the best parts of anything was the sauces put on the food. Definitely not going back here.\n",
      "Visited Vino Rosso for Summerlicious. The service was slow even though my table was the only party in the restaurant (this should have tipped us off about the quality already). No kidding, the entire place was empty except for us! Service started out well enough, but the disappointments came one after the other. Our waiter came with bread for the table but then came late with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and then again parmesan cheese as well. I am not picky about my bread but the constant disruption was not appreciated and made me feel like the service was lagging. I found myself frustrated again when (1) our waiter offered to refill our water and never came back with it (2) we had to ask twice to get the bill and (3) it took forever to get the bill, once again, considering there were no other tables in the restaurant. The food was equally underwhelming. The bread was gross, nothing more to say. The Caprese Insalata was decent but nothing special. My main, a Penne Arrabiata, tasted like glorified penne swimming in spicy tomato sauce. Definitely did NOT taste like fresh pasta as advertised. And for dessert, the waiter had the gall to tell me that I was getting a chocolate cake (Tartufo), when it was just chocolate ice cream. I could've gotten much better for much less at a local ice cream parlour. So disappointed. Will definitely not be going back to Vino Rosso. A total waste of my money. PS. For those who care, they add an automatic 15% gratuity.\n",
      "We came here for summerlicious. The apps were the best part of our meal- crab cake and calamari. Both delicious. My dining companion had the lobster ravioli and I had the salmon. The salmon was a little over done. The ravioli was good. The trio of desserts were meh. At some point I ended up with a bug in my wine glass. As soon as the waiter saw it, he got me a new glass, poured me a fresh glass of wine from the bottle and apologized for the incident. If you are not in a rush and want to go to a place where you can hear your date talk, this is a good place to go. The restaurant was at half capacity, and we found the pacing and service just right.\n",
      "THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS COMES LAST I have not even visited this place and have a terrible opinion of it. I would never set foot in it or speak well of the place as this restaurant in June wanted new customers so they offered a discount through Buytopia -- $15 spent for a $30 food voucher. I'd been ill and so waited until I felt better -- the last weekend the voucher was valid. I called to make a reservation and was told that they had what I call a \"bigger, better deal\" -- when they had the opportunity to rent out the whole place for those days, they did so. I asked the man I was speaking to whether the voucher would be honoured later than the expiry date, considering that it was their fault that I could not redeem the voucher. He told me, yes, they would; then said, ask the manager, though. Uh oh. I emailed the manager who said, yes, they booked the whole place but NO they would not honour the voucher after the expiry date (which THEY themselves, failed to honour, not I). If you make a reservation, don't be surprised if you show up and they don't serve you because of...well, they're greedy and unprofessional and lack common sense. I see this restaurant offering Groupon discounts, still. BEWARE.\n",
      "I came here for lunch with a co-worker, the waitress (who has short black hair and a thick accent) seated us at our table and completely disregarded as for over 30 minutes, until I called her over asking for bread (that they always bring over), 7 minutes later she came back with 4 pieces of cold bread. She brought over our food, I ordered the chef's recommendation which was the tortellini - the portion size was incredibly small and it only came with four thinly sliced sausages. My co-worker ordered the fettuccine with mushrooms (don't remember the exact title) it was incredibly bland, basically it was fettuccine, some mushrooms, and heavy cream, it had absolutely no flavor. The waitress only offered us black pepper and did not offer us parmigiana cheese, when in fact she offered it to everyone else. When I asked for more bread, she came back 10 minutes later with more cold bread, I had to ask her to bring us fresh bread, she disappeared for another 5 minutes and came back with hot bread (which I'm 100% was just microwaved). All in all, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not unless you really like bad service and bland tasting food.\n",
      "We had a three course meal here for lunch. Nothing special. The menu said \"crabcakes\" but it only came with 1 crabcake :(. The chicken parmesan was a bit dry. The dessert was not memorable. The service was slow. I ate 2 baskets of bread by myself waiting for our mains to arrive, and I was still hungry leaving this place... Not worth $25.\n",
      "Good value for money. Decent Italian cuisine. Rony gets a little old Italian lady to make his pasta and she does a great job on the gnocchi and his chef adds the red sauce. I recommend the veal Marsala. On the drier side, not the meat, I mean not so saucy but delicious and moist pasta and crisp veggies. Small but respectable wine list. We had a 2011 Italian Barbera for under $50. Lovely desserts and pretty good espresso.\n",
      "I went here on Valentine's Day. The service was so slow. It took them 20 mins to get my boyfriend and me water and we actually asked for it twice. For the 4 course meal, it also took so long, like 30 mins for each course. They has Valentine's manu for that day but I asked for regular menu as well because I wanted to order something else. The waitress gave me the manu but when I finally decided what to order, she told me that they couldn't do regular manu because they don't have enough time. Anyways, the food is good; just the service.\n",
      "A quaint little restaurant. Very quiet which was expected for a weekday evening. Food was great with the waiter referring to the \"Ossobuco\" as magic meat. Well I don't know if it was magical since I didn't see any sparks or flying pigs (flying veal?) but it was quite a tender piece of meat. My friend's whole wheat spaghetti was quite disappointing, such that she could not finish the dish. Overall not bad for an Italian restaurant, but would like to visit again to try out other menu items.\n",
      "This is my first time rating on Yelp as I felt it is necessary to inform everyone about what I experienced in this restaurant. We made a reservation for lunch with a few of my coworkers. I've read on Yelp that this restaurant is very understaffed and they're fairly slow on preparing the food orders. I didn't expect to wait 40 mins for an appetizer; after finishing the appetizer, we were all waiting for the main course. We waited for another 20 mins but no food has showed up yet, and we asked the waiter if the food will be ready. We waited another 10 mins and realized that we have already been in the restaurant for over an hour and it had already passed our allowed lunch time; we have only had an appetizer. As a result, we asked the waiter to have our lunch to go. Since the summerlicious menu we paid for also includes dessert, we asked the waiter if we could get the dessert to go. He was extremely unhappy about it and told us that \"you can't expect us to have your food ready in 25 mins! If you want dessert, you have to wait!\" (But we were there for over an hour). Overall, the food was not the best quality I had. It was not worth the money and time to go. Make sure you guys read Yelp before going!\n",
      "We came in here on a Thursday evening mainly because there wasn't a large number of people here. We were hungry and figured we would be able to get our food fast. We started with the soup of the day (a sweet potatoe soup) and ordered the grilled salmon with pasta and eggplant parmesan (a special of the day) to have for entree. We asked for a recommendation for what to have with our meal and were recommended a red wine. The soup tasted good flavour wise but could have been a little creamier and less watery. Both main were good, but it was a little surprsing that the eggplant parmesan wasn't served with anything else (no pasta? no rice?). It tasted great (I love eggplant), but wish I was told that so I could order something to go with it. We didn't think the wine went well with the meal, and it was a little sour as well (the perils of ordering per glass I guess). For dessert we ordered the house made tiramisu. I liked that it was not overly sweet. The service was friendly. We split the soup and dessert and they were nice enough to split the soup into two bowls rather than just give us another spoon. It wasn't as fast as we had hoped, but it wasn't necessarily slow. Other thought: It is a little dark in the restaurant. I guess that's the ambience they want there, but a part of me thought it was a little too dark.\n",
      "Went here on a Tuesday using a Travelzoo voucher. The portion sizes are small. The appetizers we had were small but tasty. I ordered the NY Striploin medium and my associate ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon. The steak was a chewy and my associates Salmon looked cooked but was raw inside. They tried to recook it and made it worse, it was now so chewy that my associate lost her appetite. On the other hand the service was good. There server was empathetic and tried to make it right, but there is only so much he could do. **EDIT** As per the Owners Response. I did mention above I used a TravelZoo voucher. The owner mentions that no bill was bought to the table. He is correct, we already paid $49 for the voucher, so more than 3/4 portion of it was already paid for. My comment was for the food alone, I would like to point out is the Salmon was RAW inside, not medium rare. As far as I know in Ontario food must be cooked well unless advised by the customer (for steaks, etc). So unless I am mistaken, what I read from the owners response, is that if you do come here for any special or voucher and if the food turns out to be uncooked, you do not have the right to be upset or post any negative reviews.\n",
      "Came here on a Thursday night with a Buytopia deal for a 3 course meal for 2 people that comes with a glass of wine or beer. I wanted to call ahead to make a reservation but the phone number for the restaurant does not work during the day, it rings once then goes to a recorded message \"Sorry the number you have called is not a sign\". I called almost every hour from 12 until 5pm and finally by 6pm, the call gets through. Super weird! When we got there, the place had a few tables, but the vibe felt very empty. There was one server working all night. She seemed like she was either new or have barely any experience at all. She gave us the set menu to choose as we showed her the deal. She came back every 5 mins asking if we were ready and every time we would say we need more time. We asked for water to start off our meal and we didn't get it until 15 mins later after we ordered. And we had to remind her one last time before she came with it, most likely have forgotten when there's only one other table in the restaurant. She brought over some bread, which seemed like its homemade with a little olive oil drizzled on top of it. But as I took a little bit into the bread, I spilt it right out!! It was SUPER SALTY!!! Like it was dipped in salt or something!! Our appetizers came which was the grilled calamari and crab cakes. BOTH were SALTY as well! Calamari was cold topped with some homemade salsa which tasted like diced tomatoes and onions tossed in olive oil. There were canned grilled red peppers on the side but they were cold as if they literally came out of the fridge. The crab cake was one round piece size of your palm cut in half. I only tasted potatoes, corn and carrots. There was no crab or didn't see any sight of crab. Tasted like I was eating potato cakes instead. SUPER DISAPPOINTING!! The mains came, which were a tapilia and 7oz steak, both with vegetables. The tapilia was dry and tasted like it has been in the freezer for ages, it had a FREEZER TASTE! The steak was cooked at the right color but it tasted stale and you can tell by the texture that it's an old piece of steak. The texture felt like it was a medium well when I ordered a medium rare, it looked like a medium rare though, which I got so confused. The steamed/boiled vegetables were the WORSE!!! One big piece of brocoli that had to be boiled for over 10 mins, it was MUSHY like baby food! The carrots were also OVERCOOKED and MUSHY, also like baby food!! The potatoes were yukon gold, cut up into BIG chunks, some were also overcooked so it was MUSHY but there was one piece that was RARE, CRUNCHY when I bit into it. WORSE VEGETABLES I have ever eaten!! Desserts were a tiramisu and new york cheesecake. The cheesecake tastes okay since you can tell that it was store brought and not made in house. The tiramisu tasted okay but texture was SUPER MUSHY!! Overall, EVERYTHING IS BAD!! FOOD IS SALTY, MUSHY, totally NOT SUPPOSE TO BE WHAT IT TASTED!! The waitress was weird all night, everytime coming to the table making it very awkward; either trying to rearrange the dishes to make it seem more convinent for us but actually not, trying to ask us about the food but reacting in an awkward way, it just made us feel UNEASY! WILL NEVER COME BACK AND DON'T SUGGEST ANYONE COMING!!!!\n",
      "First let's mention that this place offers halal meat and does not serve pork. They do use wine to cook but if you mention that you eat halal, they can make substations for you. Now, I came here with old colleagues for summerlicious and to catch up. We made reservations for 6pm. When we arrived, one of party was running late. But the server kept coming around to refill glasses and check up on us. When everyone was here, however, they tried to rush us into ordering a little. Eventually they stopped, to the point that we had to then call them over when we were all ready to order. The excellent part is a lot of us were torn on what we wanted. They were really nice and offered us to somewhat combine dishes. They usually offer a substitution for the steak, instead of mashed potatoes and veggies you can get pasta. But the pasta is usually like penne. Thy graciously allowed us to have lobster ravioli as out pasta side. Two pieces of ravioli (the actually dish has 6 pieces) with our steak. We even got complimentary veggies to share amongst the four of us. The downside to this great offer was that I ordered a medium steak and got something closer to medium-well. And the lobster ravioli wasn't that great. Although the sauce was amazing. For our apps we had gotten calamari, meatballs and crab cake. The crab cake was a bit lonely, just one cake. The meatballs were good. But tiny and only four. The calamari was delicious! The most pathetic part of our meal was the dessert. When put together it was pretty yummy, esp the ricotta gelato. The brownie was okay and the poached pear looked like tuna sashimi on the plate. It was yummy but two pieces of it was too much for the tiny dollop of gelato. I wish they hadn't presented it deconstructed on such a large plate. So the food was hit and miss. My negative comments relate to the service. We were very pleased with the service until we finished dinner and dessert and no one came around for ages. Then they went to get four bills and did come back for another 15 mins. In the meantime I had to use the washroom. When I saw there was no toilet paper, I went back to notify one of the employees there. She said okay, but did not go to replace the roll. I had to borrow wet wipes from a friend to use their washroom ...... That is not good service. ESP in a restaurant. That isn't bustling with diners. Lastly, I paid in cash and it took another 15 mins before my change came around and we could finally leave. This seems like a nice place, but it also seems like they won't be open for long. The food was okay, the service averages to okay. They weren't busy. I won't be going back. It's harsh to say it, but it definitely doesn't look like a business that will last.\n",
      "This is a decent Pet Valu that's fairly new-ish. It's not as fancy as some of the other ones, like Yonge & St. Clair but a step up in size atmosphere from the Galleria one. They took over this space a few years when the retail strip just east shut for a condo development. It used to be a mechanic garage, which is why it's so large on the inside and is surrounded by 2 garages. They have Toronto Cat Rescue cats and kittens available for adoption here. Support a local charity and rescue a TCR feline! A good selection of food and discounts if you buy by the case. They don't carry Orijen brand, but that's true of all Pet Valus. Hopefully they'll have it in the future. They also have a wide range of accessories and I've always found the staff to be friendly. The parking lot is little messed up because it's super narrow and there's no real spots outlined. Only about 3 cars can park in front of the store and the rest have to park on the other side across from the Midas. If it ever got busy here it would easily devolve into double parking, but so far I've never seen that happen.\n",
      "I've been shopping at this store, since it was located across the street in the late 1990s. Convenient, decent prices and quirky staff. Located near the Indian Grove exit of the Keele TTC, it is a possible store for folks living along the Bloor Danforth subway line.\n",
      "I have three cats, two of which are on veterinarian food, but one of which gets food specifically recommended by staff here. I've been going to this Pet Valu for four years now, and the staff have helped me with recommendations for litter, food, behaviour and toys. I love that they work with Toronto Cat Rescue on such a regular basis, and that they carry a wide variety of alternative cat food, treats, and toys. They have a rewards program for customers, if you buy the same food your 10th bag is free! It may not sound like a lot, but with three cats? It's helpful! It's not the most \"chic\" pet store, but I find that a lot of those boutique pet stores in the Junction/High Park area carry the same products at much higher cost. The store is easily reached from the alternate east-end exit at Keele Station, or the regular west-end entrance if accessibility is an issue.\n",
      "For the prices at this store the quality of service is very poor. When the shop used to be across the road, before the condo was built there, the service was very personal and helpful. Now everything about the store including the staff remarks and the prices is a bit on snobby side and if you are looking for a pet which is not a dog or a cat, then the clerk will wriggle up her nose in disgust. I asked where I could find Mouse food and she directed me to the back wall where there was none. When I asked at the desk a SECOND time, after waiting in line this time, she said we don't carry it LOL. Well that was a wasted free steps except I did look at the treats and I found a few made in Canada which is good so they got my money. They made no effort to order the food for me even though they clearly order from Oxbow for other creatures. I then called Global down the road a couple of blocks and they didn't have it either but she immediately offered to order it for me. I even told the Pet Valu clerk that I was disappointed she didn't order it for me but she is the expert in teflon remarks. They also carry mouse treats made in China which for anything that an animal will ingest is very disappointing. When I mentioned this to the clerk I got this teflon remark \"well we can't have everything made in CAnada\". I have shopped here since we first got our first pet (dog) in 2006 and I can honestly say I don't like this location any longer. The one mouse wheel we purchased was broken and we had no problems with the products purchased at Pet Smart but the Pet Smart is an american store and it's quite a bit further away. Still at least they have stock and they show gratitude. I would have thought for the money I did spend today I would have at least heard the word thank you. There are lots of other places to choose on this stretch of Bloor, don't waste your money or your time here.\n",
      "A great local pet store, just around the block from my house. The staff is always friendly and helpful when I'm shopping, and the few times I've brought my Flemish Giant bunny in, they absolutely adore her! One of my favourite things about this location is that they sell TWO brands of Ontario-grown hay, something I am quickly learning as a rabbit owner is harder to find than you'd think. They carry both the Dunlea Farms hay in a tidy feeder, and my new favourite brand, Knee-Deep Farms hay. The latter is especially a great bargain at $7 for a huge bag, and my bunny ADORES it, her favourite hay by far. The only thing loosing one star for me is that they have a very limited selection of small animal products. I definitely always come here for my bunny's food, litter, and hay, but seek other stores out for her toys and accessories, as they really don't have much. But again, it's a smaller store and bunny products are a fairly small market.\n",
      "A very classy O'Club with good food and a great bar. Make sure to stop in the Check Six for a few drinks.\n",
      "Really enjoy their salads, HUGE! And really cheap! Return factor? YOU BET!\n",
      "Went to my former Colonels' retirement ceremony and it was renovated nicely.\n",
      "I've been to the O Club a few times including the squadron's \"Dining Out\" dinner. Dinner was average. All very well done and good service. Nice big spacious venue. I was here recently for a special Mass and refreshments were served afterwards (pastries, donuts, coffee, juice). A very convenient base venue to use for your next event.\n",
      "Was out at Nellis Air Force Base for a conference and we ate lunch at The Club one day. I've been on quite a few military bases in my life, but have only eaten at a few O-Clubs. The Club here at Nellis is a very nice facility with great service...and great food to go with it. I wasn't tremendously hungry when we came, but I ordered the Reuben and it was really quite good. Not as good as the Jewish delis back home in Jersey, but good enough. Looking around it seemed like a big thing to order was a salad...I say 'big thing' because the salads were BIG salads. Pretty simple to review this place - Good food, good service, good prices. Can't go wrong...\n",
      "Unfortunately, we had the worst server in the restaurant. She was a blond woman with glasses and seemed to be spending more time socializing at the bar vs. waiting on tables. Our food took over an hour and even then one entree was missing. Never received any refills on our water and we also made the mistake of ordering dessert... The dessert took another half an hour and our ice cream was fully melted. I am quite sure this is an awesome restaurant, but we just had the worst server employed there. Hopefully mgmt knows who this server is based on my description, they see this review, and take disciplinary action. Very disappointed, will not be recommending this place to anyone.\n",
      "We went there for late lunch on Sunday. We biked there and with a 3 year old daughter. Felt a little under dressed for the place, but everyone there was very nice and friendly. Very happy with what we ordered and the service too! We want to try their dinner and I feel like I know it's gonna be a great one too!\n",
      "I've been to this restaurant twice now and the food was amazing both times around. The first time I went with a couple of friends and we decided to try out a bunch of dishes and share them between all of us. Even though it was a little pricey the service was amazing and our waiter was very knowledgeable and stopped by many times to see how things were going. I knew that I would definitely come back again. The second time around is the reason why I knocked off a star, instead of giving the full 5 which I would have after the first visit. Just like the last time the food was incredible, I ordered the mushroom risotto which is hands down the best risotto I have had! The restaurant itself has a great vibe and looks very up to date. My main complaint has to do with the service we received. We started off with one server who poured our drinks and said he would be back shortly to take our orders. We both decided pretty quickly on what dish to ordered however our server had disappeared. After waiting and waiting we ended up flagging down a different server who ended up taking over for the rest of the night. The second guy was a lot better and managed to turn the evening around completely. I would definitely recommend checking them out for their great food.\n",
      "Some of the most delicious Italian food I've had. I was surprised by how cool the inside of this restaurant looked since the outside is just black but it's awesome. My boyfriend and I ordered an app and two pasta dishes. The servers we had were very nice. They filled up our water, cleared our plates in a timely fashion. The server brought us bread while we waited for our app and the butter/ginger/garlic dressing that came with it was different and yummy. Our appetizer was so fresh and crispy! Our main pasta dishes were just as fresh and filling. We even forked out some room for tiramisu which I cannot even explain how creamy it was. One of the beat tiramisu's I've had. The only thing that wasn't that great was the turnover time between meals because they make the food fresh (i think) but definitely worth the $$. Two thumbs up!\n",
      "Went for my birthday last night - great atmosphere, great food, great experience. We has the salumi plate, fennel salad (salads are meal sized), pizza, Nutella tiramisu and a desert of the day I can't pronounce. Lost one star because I believe the price is a LITTLE high for what you get (compared with marcellos), eg the cheapest glass of wine is $12.50, but beer is normal. Most expensive glass of wine is $58/glass\n",
      "Wonderful atmosphere to enjoy time with family and friends. The food never disappoints from the pizza, polenta fries, salad, pasta, risotto, lamb and veal scallopini!!! Everyone's meal was delicious. You must have to leave room for dessert. Nutella and Fruita de Bosca pizzas were delicious. Hostess and wait staff are extremely welcoming and accommodating. Looking forward to going back soon.\n",
      "Just a fabulous Italian restaurant. Their pizza is among the best we've had and their other dishes, including pasta, are just beautiful. Make sure to check outthe daily specials, the list can be extensive. Motorino is gorgeous inside, with a really cool vibe topped off with good service. A must visit in Woodbridge.\n",
      "I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a family function. I had no idea there was even a restaurant in this area being that it's in a small strip mall but it takes up most of the space, about half it seems. The inside of this restaurant is really visually striking. The red and black theme is throughout the interior from the signs, walls, and tables. The menu has a mixed of antipasto, salads, pasta, meats, fish, risotto and pizzas. It's a decent mix of dishes and choices. I ended up getting the quattro stagione and my wife had ordered the white potato pizza. The quattro stagione literally translated means four seasons. I'm used to seeing this pizza's ingredients on each of the 4 quarters pizzas like quadrants. I didn't get it that way for some reason. All the ingredients (mushrooms, prosciutto, olives and artichokes) were evenly spread across the pizza. It was still decent but just not what I was expecting to see. My wife ate about half of her potato pizza. Typically if we go to a place that serves pizza she'll always go with a white pizza (no red sauce) if it's an option and she likes potato pizza in general where ever she can find it. She only ate half of it as she usually does but she said it was too greasy. I was too full to have any of her pizza since I ate all of mine at the restaurant. The potato pizza came with onions and pancetta. I'm used to pancetta being thicker and more fatty like bacon. Honestly this pancetta looked like deli sliced cooked ham. We took home the left overs and I ended up eating them that night. I have to say the potato pizza was very greasy I have to agree with my wife. The bottom crust was in fact saturated and it wasn't pretty. Overall the pizzas weren't out of this world and I can safely say that in the GTA we've had much better than this. It seemed that the toppings weren't very generous or distributed properly. I mean the quattro stagione is not even in quarters. Don't get me wrong I've had Neapolitan style pizza before so I know what to sort of expect and mind you this place although not VPN certified like Libretto or Pizza e Pazzi doesn't have to be like many other places out there but I simply found this pizza to be not as good all around. Whether it's the thickness of the crust or the ingredients simply put it's not as good as some of the other non-VPN Neapolitan type style pizza out there in the GTA (850 Degrees, Napoli Centrale). It is IMO a notch lower than Grazie. I can't speak to the rest of the menu but as far as the pizza for me, this is not a go to place. The service was attentive and friendly.\n",
      "My second time at this restaurant. Decent food, causal atmosphere, good portions, and reasonable prices. Dined here on a Friday night. Walked in without a reservation at quarter to 7 and was seated without issue. The restaurant was pretty busy though so we may have lucked out getting a table. They have my favourite wine by the glass (caymus cab sauv) so the restaurant is an automatic winner in my books! They have tons of specials so no worries if you don't like anything on their menu! I ordered the salumiere plate to start. You really can't go wrong with cured meats, and you get tons of it for $18! My friend ordered the caprese Di bufala which was kinda disappointing. The tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough and the bufala wasn't as creamy or flavourful as one would like. I ordered one of the meat specials (Tagliata di manzo with truffled salad for $32) - which was essentially a carved steak with an arugula salad. I love arugula salad, but I must admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't come as a fancy schmancy salad as the name suggested. The steak was a bit veiny but probably my fault for ordering a not so great cut of meat rare. My friend ordered the salmon special which looked fantastic. I didn't try the fish, but I did steal a brussel sprout and it was pretty good (and I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts at all!). Ended the meal with a latte (very unremarkable) and the tiramisu. The tiramisu was a lot more cream than I had expected, but I really enjoyed it. Service was good albeit unmemorable. A decent place for a laid back casual dinner!\n",
      "Had to chime in since the scores were so low. Have eaten here approx 6 times and loved it every time. Have tried most of the appetizers and the Marguerita, Margherita DOP, and Sophia pizzas. Their pizza is the best I've had and yes I've been to Pizza Libretto and AutoStrata. I also think the Tiramisu is the best I've had. So light, almost frothy. You are better off with a reservation but for a party of 2 you can sit at the bar until a table becomes available.\n",
      "I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I have been here numerous times and the food, service and atmosphere have always been outstanding. Today we had the calzone di Napoli for lunch and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks to Kirk, Frank and Temo for a wonderful experience here, yet again! Oh! The live music on Thursday nights is great too! Lots of fun! I didn't like that they charge you $2 per person if you bring in your own birthday cake seeing as we spent quite a bit on food and alcohol.\n",
      "Service is outstanding! They always go above and beyond when serving. The food is fantastic! We are already repeat customers and can't wait to go back again.\n",
      "We had a quick dinner recently. We originally called and they told me they can only seat us at 930. But we were in the neighborhood and thought to try our luck at 8. Got the bar seats. But there were so many empty tables around us !! The food was okay. I want to highlight the octopus dishes and the charcoal veggie pizza. The octopus was soooo fishy and chewy, way more than expected. It took a few bites to get used to. But if thats your kinda thing, I'd imagine youd love it. The main reason to come here to try the pizza. It was not as I expected. It was a little dry and the black olives were extremely salty. Not a big deal, we just picked it off. Overall, the staff were friendly, the atmosphere was nice and the food was okay. I'd go back.\n",
      "I had lunch here last week with a colleague. The service was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the salad to start (mista) and I had the rib steak for my main. The salad was fresh, perfectly dressed, and a huge portion. This was an entree sized portion of salad. My rib steak was flavourful but it was rare rather than my requested medium rare. I'd rather have my steak under than over, so I didn't bother complaining about it. Again, the portions of their entrees are huge. I ate about 2/3 of my steak, most of my rapini and didn't touch my mashed potatoes and I was super full. The bread they serve with roasted garlic on the side and hot pepper-infused oil was delicious as well. If you like Italian food, this is the place for you.\n",
      "If you want an outstanding pizza, this is the place! Atmosphere: Modern, edgy and themed. Cleanliness: Great Constructive criticism: N/A Cuisine: Italian Facilities: Clean Food: excellent, unique, and quality in mind. Great flavors captured. Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: deffinitley Parking: Private, although tight since the lot is small. Portion Sizes: fair Price: a little high Service: Professional, knowledgable, and warm Selection: Wide variety of italian cuisine.\n",
      "Got their neopolitan pizza for takeout - was very good!\n",
      "I Absolutely love this place. The food is very good. The service is pleasant and the atmosphere is very welcoming\n",
      "This used to be the go to restaurant for dinners after work or on the weekends with both family and friends. Everything in the menu was great, especially the Specials and the Pizza. Service was great too although the place was always very busy. For the past couple of months this restaurant is starting to lose its vibe - all the previous staff are not there anymore and the service is not great although the place is half empty. The food is also not consistent and it often looks messy on the plate. The Specials' board only has a few specials.. Drove by to have dinner last night around 8:00PM and there was only 1 table in the restaurant - I have never seen Motorino empty like that before. I understand there are new owners - if they don't maintain the restaurant as it was before, including the food and service, they will lose all the clientele and it's a shame because Motorino is a great restaurant. Don't try to change the restaurant; it was successful before for a reason!!\n",
      "Motorino is one of the restaurants in my neighbourhood, so expectations at finding another great place to dine at were high. Needless to say, since my initial visit I have yet to go back. The place has a youthful, high energy vibe about ........one would hope the food and the service would live up to the hype. We arrived without a reservation so we had to wait for a table to become available. Certainly not the restaurants fault. We perused the menu while waiting and the wait was only approx. 10 minutes. The smells in the restaurant were intoxicating.....so by the time our waiter came by for a drink order, we were ready to order our food. Waiters attitude was off-putting, as though he was doing us the favour by allowing himself to be our server. We ordered and off he went.......never came back to check on us. He did stop by a table near to us as he had friends in dining that night and actually sat with them for a few minutes chatting.....all while we had empty drink glasses in front of us. We had to flag him down on one of his many trips past us for a drink refill order. Food arrived after a substantial wait (it was very busy so one must expect the kitchen to be overwhelmed) but it was unmemorable. Two of us had ordered pizza...and both agreed we've had much better elsewhere. The other members of our party were equally unimpressed with their food. Obviously this restaurant is going for a younger crowd than us (lol) but the noise, combined with average food flavour, warrants this rating. We have not gone back\n",
      "It's a pity. It was very nice restaurant. Right now I'm having lunch. It's empty. Including us 4 people. Before it was packed. employees look unhappy. I went to washroom. It was dirty. No soap no paper. How did they turn in too bad from an outstanding restaurant it's unbelievable. . It's going to be my last visit.\n",
      "We really wanted to like this place as its close to home but unfortunately will not return. The first part of our night went well...the place was not busy at all so we were quickly seated, good vibe, trendy decor, youthful and family-friendly. Our waiter started out great - very personable tho the poor guy had to spend almost 5 minutes on his spiel about the 12+ items on Special. He provided some good recommendations on apps and mains. The octopus salad was a great kick-start to the night. This was followed by an avocado and burrato stromboli which was over a foot-long and very filling (they messed up this order by putting ham in it but we took it because it looked yummy). We only had a small piece each in order to save room for the mains. Well that wasnt necessary since we hardly touched the mains - the papardelle was over-cooked and sticking together and the fennel salad was very over-dressed. The biggest dissapointment were the fridge-temperature meatballs - not room temperature, but they were actually cold inside. We couldnt find out waiter for a while and twice had to ask different staff to retrieve him. The hostess/manager was good about taking care of these items on the bill and providing complementary dessert. Based on the other positive reviews, this place could be a hit or miss but I definitely wouldn't chance it again.\n",
      "Had dinner tonight at this restaurant with my husband. All in all I wasn't impressed. Pizza was very flimsy and soggy. Cesar salad had little flavour. Penne a la vodka was very good. Service was awful. Our waiter was too busy so she had another server take our order. She then proceeded to not ever come to our table and we had no waiter the whole evening. we had to ask for everything - drinks, water refills and hot oil multiple times. We had to ask to pay our bill multiple times. Asked for the manager to come over and he never showed. After waiting about 15 minutes we just left. Do not recommend and will never return.\n",
      "I went in January for dinner and enjoyed the menu and service. Went back with my husband to find the menu had been changed and I found the wine very over priced. Disappointing. Not worth the money\n",
      "I hosted my birthday party on Sept.3/2016 at Motorino and they did a fantastic job! We were a party of 14 and the service was phenomenal. The waiter let us split bills, was so knowledgable about the menu and was very attentive. The food was fantastic and all my guests were happy. I'm so glad we booked our party here and would definitely do it again.\n",
      "Motorino Enoteca does have a modern and youth decoration. Loud, high energy and quite chic. I just wish the food and the services can be as high energy as the vibe! Dropping by for a late lunch and the services was just indifferent and slow. My Rigatoni alla Norma (Fried eggplant, light tomato sauce and Imported riotta salata) for $16 is not bad in taste but definitely overpriced. No bread was ever offered... wish I have that to dip it in the tomato sauce. Maybe it just me, if I ordered rounds and rounds of drinks, my services maybe a lot better? There are so many options of good Italian food in the area, I think I am going to skip Motorino!\n",
      "Was recommended to eat at this unfriendly place. The staff made us feel that they were doing us a favour for eating at their restaurant. The wait staff was a joke. We started out with an Italian waiter that could not be understood since his English was terrible, he mumbled and treated us as we never have been to an Italian restaurant. He also looked dirty with a pencil mustache. He kept coming back to our table even though we told him that we are not ready to order. We then got a replacement of another useless waiter. This guy was spraying tables like a lunatic with sterilizer that could be smelled from across the room. When will they learn to spray the liquid on the rag? So if anyone is looking for over dressed salads, oily pastas, heartburn pizza and bad espresso this is the place. Downtown prices poorly executed dishes. The food ingredients were fresh. Only positive. Italian mall food would be better.\n",
      "She did a fabulous job with my nails. Already have an appt set in 5 days. Wouldn't go to anyone else. It was an awesome experience being taken care of.\n",
      "I have been on a hunt for a good nail tech ever since my last place got new staff & just changed everything about it. I can't even tell you how many places I've gone to that have disappointed me. But then I found this place & Vicky! She does an amazing job with nail art & I can always count on her to make my nails look great! So happy I have someone I can trust with my nails again!\n",
      "Had a great experience. Good conversation a.d she wss wuivk whivh I loved! Thank you Vicky.\n",
      "Vicky was awesome. Super nice and friendly. Great gel manicure! She even pointed out a check-in deal I wasn't aware of and saved me $5. I'll be back for sure. Thank you Vicky!\n",
      "I found Vicky through Yelp. I needed to get my nails done for my wedding, and it had been a very long time since I had gotten my nails done. I used to go to just little shops around town, but I would always find imperfections in my nails. I'm so glad I found Vicky, she definitely knows what she is doing. She takes her times forming and sculpting your nails, you can tell she loves what she is doing. I got a pedicure and a full set and I'm totally in love. If you're thinking if you should go, think no longer. Call Vicky, and schedule an appointment. You will be so happy you did .\n",
      "I came in as a first time customer and Vicky penciled me in her schedule. I am so glad she did that! My whole experience was amazing! I walked in at the time of my appointment and didn't have to wait. Vicky is very friendly. We've talked the entire time she was doing my mani/pedi. No awkward moments and I like her!! I highly recommend!\n",
      "I've been getting my nails done for over 20 years now. I've never really been 100 % satisfied with the work of others, but Vicky is amazing, she does quality work and is such a positive person. I have my third appointment with Vicky today and anxious to see what beautiful designs we come up with!\n",
      "First time customer and Vicky was able to fit me in to her schedule extremely last minute. Her work is amazing and she was very gentle with my nails. I am so glad that I gave Vicky a call I will most definitely be going back to her. Thank You Vicky.\n",
      "I had a horrible experience with another nail salon and came in for a fill she did an amazing job! Shaped my nails the way they were supposed to be and took her time with me! Used gel polish that was perfect (never used before. At the other shop they said It was gel but nothing like this) we laughed and talked a lot while doing my nails!! Super super happy as this is my first fill ever in my life and only about the 4/5th time I've ever done my nails!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! Will always go to you when I want my nails done!\n",
      "I am literally in love with my nails! She did exactly what I wanted and they look amazing! I would definitely recommend going to see her! I will for sure be coming back!!\n",
      "We were there for Groupon. The service was very good from the ladies. That's where it end. The atmosphere is very poor. The lighting makes me feel dull. The cook doesn't even know how to make the atmosphere enjoyable. It seems like he just want to get the cooking over with and barely have a smile. He price is definitely high for the cooking and taste of this restaurant.\n",
      "Went there with a groupon. Including the cost of groupon it ended up being 50$ a person. Service: (5 stars) + great accommodations with the weird groupon rules - 4 of us went with 2 separate groupons and they were accommodating to have us at the same table. (they did not have to) + the bill included tax and tip and they notified us of the tip ahead that tip was already added . + generally friendly Food: (4.5 stars) These were all the food that we have gotten: Miso soup House salad with ginger dressing Chef's selection sushi roll AAA Strip loin Steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, jumbo shrimp, and Atlantic scallops Teppanyaki vegetables Veggie Fried rice Japanese Ice Cream (Mango or Green Tea) The protein was pretty small, we got 3 shrimp, 2 scallops, and the rest was cut in small pieces so unsure how much of food it actually was. However it was enough to leave all of very full at the end of the meal. Scallops and the steak were my favorite. Atmosphere (3 stars): The person who was serving us was nice, however he only did a few trick (onion volcano, and bouncing the egg on the spatula) You can see the video: https://youtu.be/0gakol3OuGU The place was clean, I just expected more of a show. Overall: The groupon was cool due to different protein's that we got, but compared to the regular menu seemed just slightly under the normal cost.\n",
      "These guys are great & they took our party of 40 without deposit without advance notice & gave us excellent service. The food was excellent but the thing that impressed me the most was that when I told them about my unique yet deadly allergy to raw carrots, they took it very serious & cooked all my food separately in the kitchen.\n",
      "Service was amazing! The food preparation was exciting and entertaining. For st asters we got signs and dumplings and for my main I had the AAA filet mignon and it was impeccable! I highly recommend this restaurant and the dish!\n",
      "Had a great experience! Service was amazing! It was great to watch the chef do his thing right in front. Food was delicious as well. Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Great service and delicious food. We enjoyed our time there. I truly recommend this place for birthday celebrations and friends hangouts..\n",
      "Servers were very nice. Our chef was hilarious with his tricks and jokes and the food was amazing!\n",
      "Overall great experience! Food was delicious. We had the select 2 combo and chose chicken and steak. The chef was entertaining. Service was friendly\n",
      "ATROCIOUS. The service was slow, disorganized and inattentive. We ordered sushi as an appetizer which arrived after our soup and salad. The sushi was far below average - don't even touch the yellowtail. As we waited for our appetizers our wine came even slower and apparently sharing a glass of water is a thing. The other people at the table all received their cooked appetizers before the meal. The teppanyaki chef was dull and rushing to get through our table. Sadly he wasn't in such a hurry as to cook our filet mignon rare as ordered. In short nothing went well. The food was bland, poorly prepared and presented.\n",
      "If I could, I would have given this no star. I am a big teppanyaki fan and have been to many other teppanyaki restaurants outside and inside of Toronto. Yet it was not only the worst Teppanyaki experience I have ever had, but also one of the worst restaurant experiences overall.. It's been few weeks since I had my first (and hopefully the last) visit to Hibachi. Two of my girlfriends and I came in right on time for our reservation. The hostess approached us then said our table was not ready. It was understandable at first since it was a busy friday night. She had us seated at the bar and we ordered a cocktail each just to kill some time. Everything was great until then. The cocktails were tasty and we were all in a good mood. We didn't know it'd take more than 40 mins for them to actually \"get our table ready\". We finished our drinks after 20 mins and very kindly asked the hostess when our table will be ready. She said she will figure it out for us then left us for another good 20mins without giving us any heads up. After some time, FINALLY the other hostess (different one from the one who sat us at the bar) told us the table is ready and we HAVE TO settle our bills before we leave the bar. So we settled our bills. We were seated at the table and not after so long, the server approached us. We already knew what we wanted and ordered. He said we have to wait for the table to be filled. So we waited.. again. Skipping to the conclusion, the whole process of waiting for the other customers to arrive, to order food, and to actually have the chef show up to the table took ANOTHER 35 mins. We were starving. The show began and it was just mediocre. Same old onion volcanoes and some other basic tricks that you see at other teppanyaki restaurants. For food, we ordered a green dragon roll to share as an appetizer, then fillet mignon for myself and two other things from their teppanyaki main menu for my friends. The green dragon roll, I still remember just because of the poorly cut avocados on top of the roll. Wanted my fillet mignon to be cooked rare and turned out to be cooked medium. My friends and I were actually too tired out to make complaints by the time we were served. The food, to be honest, was not the worst but not the best either. In total, it took hibachi 75MINS to put just any food into our mouths. I understand how the teppanyaki restaurants work.. but this was just overwhelming. And yet, the best part hasn't come out. We were just about half way done eating when we heard something unexpected. Apparently, who seemed to be like the manager or the supervisor was YELLING at one of his staffs in front of all the customers. It was really REALLY uncomfortable to witness the whole yelling, shouting, and swearing while eating. Yes, swearing. We didn't finish our food. We just asked for the bill, paid, then came out. The staffs were nice and friendly, but that is actually the only nice thing I could say about this place. If anyone wants to try teppanyaki, just go somewhere else. It's just not worth it to spend the amount of time and the money for such place.\n",
      "We had been eyeing the new Hibachi Grill which opened up this fall at the Thompson Toronto, as we literally live a block away. So on my husband's birthday I decided to make reservations. We ended up going with the prix fixe menu, with some upgrades. This includes soup, salad, fried rice, sushi rolls, ice cream on top of the grilled meats and veggies. The fare was pretty standard for a hibachi grill, steak, chicken, scallops and shrimp. They did add lobster to the mix, which was nice touch. The scoops of ice cream were nice-sized, which is good cause my hubs loves ice cream. The most entertaining part of course were the antics of the chef juggling his tools and setting food on fire. (See the two videos I posted.) I had previously asked to add on a birthday package, but as the evening drew to a close I saw no sign of it. Even my mother-in-law commented that a candle and cake would have been nice. A couple of gentle reminders later, the wait staff did serenade my husband with drums, a chef hat and really nice green tea cheesecake (yes, with a candle ) They even gave us a framed photo, which was a nice memento of the evening. The only down side was that although mostly courteous, there is a little bit of a language barrier with some of the wait staff. This was a bit unexpected given the venue. None-the-less, it was a really fun evening. My Rating: 3.5/10. 1.5 points deducted because food although good, was pretty standard, no delectable surprises. 1 point deducted for wait staff forgetting the birthday package and potentially embarrassing me in front of my in laws. Pro Tip: When you make the reservations, ask to purchase coupons at the door. You get a 2 for 1 deal on the prix fixe menu, which works really well with the wallet.\n",
      "Nice ambience and service. I am not a teppanyaki lover so I didn't particularly appreciate the effort at show-cooking but I am sure some people would. The food was good (I had a mix of scallops, prawns and lobster), I actually enjoyed the small starter of sashimi so also the raw fish bar could be worth it. Price was okay.\n",
      "Delicious meal! I dined here with my boyfriend this past Saturday! I got the salmon combo, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken & scallops. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The portions were huge! Definitely get your money's worth. Excellent service, our chef Justin was awesome! Really good first experience, and I will definitely be back soon!!!\n",
      "I have to say that what really got my attention was the service. Our server was exceptionally friendly, and good with customers overall. I had just wished the chef would have been more enthusiastic. There may have only been 4 people at our table, but the show just seemed a little lacklustre. The egg toss and fire volcano were nice, but the performance just felt very \"let's get this over with\". Aside from the service, I have to say the food was a bit of a letdown. We used a Groupon that listed a $140 face value for 2 people, which is a HUGE inflation.The food was just average. Sad to say that I've had better miso soup and Japanese salad at AYCE restaurants. The chef's choice roll was pretty decent. I'm not sure if it was chicken or shrimp tempura, but the roll tasted okay. The teppanyaki I must say provided a substantial amount of food with LOTS of variety. Lobster, shrimp, scallops, chicken and steak cooked the way you want it. They give you dark and light sauces to dip in. The dark tastes like typical steak sauce, and the light tastes like a thousand island mayonnaise variation. Without the sauce the food is rather bland. While it has a nice charred flavour to it, a little salt or seasoning would have been nice. The green tea ice cream was much creamier than I expected. To be honest, if I closed my eyes, I probably would have thought it was vanilla. Overall a 3.5 star experience. Food was okay, show was okay, service was exceptional! After tax and tip, it wasn't too far from the face value. I don't know where $140 came from, but I really wouldn't have been able to justify that price.\n",
      "BAD EXPERIENCE TURNED GREAT! I had an interesting visit to this restaurant for my 30th birthday. I had gone with a large group of friends and was really looking forward to the Teppanyaki experience however there were a lot of short-comings the entire night. The service we received was poor. I wouldn't say that it was really busy in the restaurant - perhaps 5 other tables at the time. The waiter was forgetting many items and the worst thing was that they gave my birthday cake that my friend had brought it for me to another table. They had also lost my friend's umbrella which they had said they would keep at the front because it was wet from the rain. This was a bit let down that it ruined the whole night. That being said - I had spoke to the manager over a period of weeks who promised to replace the umbrella and offered to have me back to dine again. 2 months after my first visit I returned with my boyfriend. And it is safe to say they absolutely redeemed themselves. The manager - Joey was very friendly and checked up on us to make sure our experience was good. We were even served by the same waiter who we had the first time. He was very professional, polite and apologized for our previous experience. The food itself was great! I had the Fillet mignon, lobster & scallops which was all cooked perfectly! The chef was quiet but did an excellent job of making sure we were well entertained. Definitely will return!\n",
      "This place is great for lunch during the week. It was pretty quiet but they still do the full on tepanyaki show. The meal ended up being pretty affordable for what it was. The lunch special was a great deal. The sake was good too. They mostly do warm sake they said but can make any of the sakes cold. The one we had was interesting because it was unfiltered. The service was friendly. Overall, this spot is great value for a show and a meal, especially during lunch. It's great that such a place is open for lunch. I haven't tried it for dinner but I definitely recommend it for lunch!\n",
      "Had a great experience here at Hibachi. The food and service was good, the price is okay but it's definitely worth it if you go every so often for that experience. The chefs put on a little cooking show and it's nice to watch, I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and they had the cutest/funniest birthday package (couldn't stop laughing). Overall it was a really nice experience.\n",
      "I had a good time with my mom eating here at the hibachi for dinner. The experience was great. Our chef's name was Justin. I really enjoyed the part where he lit the onion on fire. He also tried to threw little pieces of broccoli into our mouths with his spatula. He succeeded the first two times and then it didn't go so well for the rest of us but it was a good laugh. The food was actually really bland. The teriyaki sauce they used is extremely light and the dipping sauces they provided, which were a mayo-based and a ginger/soy sauce based,were also a bit plain. And I'm not a person that usually eat salty stuff. Portion is plenty though. Also, expect the steak to be over cooked because they were chopped into small pieces. The Groupon was $75 for two plus tax and 15% service charge already added which ended up being $97.46. I don't think it was a good deal because I think the deluxe combo which is $42 per person is somewhat similar but comes with filet mignon and salmon if I remember correctly. Groupon claims that this deal is originally $150 in value is very much an exaggerated overstatement. Overall was a good experience but I don't think it's worth a second visit. It's maybe really a 3.5 star.\n",
      "Our group of eight were here on my birthday. Excellent service provided by our host Shogu (spelt incorrectly), very friendly and accommodative to our requests for shifting us to a smaller table and making changes to the price fixed menu due to dietary requirements. Ambiance was smart casual, and very modern. Food was excellent and plentiful, cooked with some fanfare by the chef. Scallops, shrimp, steak and chicken were cooked to perfection as requested by each couple, sauces provided for those who needed more flavor with their meat or seafood dishes. A really nice place to come with a group due to the Teppanyaki style of cooking right at the table, although we had to speak loudly in order to get heard at the other end of the table. When one of my friends mentioned to the host Shogu it was my birthday, we got a cheesecake slice with a candle on it, a group picture was taken, printed and put on a card for the group to sign ... a very nice touch. An extra star just for this neat little surprise. I would recommend Hibachi at the Thompson and would definitely come back again.\n",
      "Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night as we had purchased a groupon ($75 for a 7 course meal for 2). The service was great, servers were overly friendly and accommating. We first got our miso soup (delicious! Not too salty and perfectly hot) then our house ginger salad (delicious as well). We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I've had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream! Overall, my bf and I had a great time and really enjoyed our food and the entertainment. Would come here again but only on special occasions as it it on the pricier side (paid over $100 for the groupon with tax/tip and a couple beers) :)\n",
      "The service was friendly and engaging, but when it comes to the food, well mind I say the most overpriced and overrated I've ever encountered in Toronto? It feels like you've walked into the 1990s where people crowd around teppanyaki as a form of exotic oriental performance, that said, the food is inevitably secondary to the performance they've put on. I truly do believe there is a lot of work, effort, and skill each and every chef invests in, but as a restaurant itself, I can't bring myself to say I would ever come here again or pretend to like the lacklustre-uneventful taste of such a theatrical meal. You're paying $30+ for a performance, a seat at a orientalist facade. With all that being said, service was friendly, but the food comes before all decor or presentation\n",
      "We took my niece here for her 16th birthday. Our cook was more on the quiet side.... did the standard show with the onion fire volcano, but no talking beyond \"how do you like your steak cooked?\" hence only 4 stars. Over all the food tasted great and we had fun watching our food get cooked.\n",
      "Great pizza and customer service. I really like the Diavola. Love the big wood tables.\n",
      "Definitely one of the best places for Pizza in Las Vegas. However, it tends to be a hit or miss with the service, they are constantly short staffed and the servers approach is nothing special. Anyways, I'm always back for their delicious pizzas.\n",
      "What a nice pleasant surprise. Right by where we go to the movies. Had no idea it was here. We had their signature settebello pizza and cappuccino. It was wonderfully priced right and came with friendly service from Alexa. Like Arnold said \"I'll be back\"!!\n",
      "I've been hearing the hype about this place for a while. Now that it is around the corner from my house I decided to give it a try. We started with a salad that came with unedible croutons and greens I needed a knife to make a reasonable size. For the pizza we ordered the Quattro Formaggi. Is it standard at Settebello that the dough is so soggy all the cheese & sauce slides right off the pizza? If this is what \"Real\" pizza is supposed to be like I'm not interested. Flavor was good though. Our server was pretty nice, décor is fine. During our visit the place was mostly empty. I'm going to give Settebello a shot a few months from now to see how I feel about it- This location is fairly new. Grimaldi's is still my favorite pizza place for now.\n",
      "What can be said about this place that hasn't been said about world peace? It's wonderful but, vera pizza is possible now. I am somewhat of a regular here and need to get in the habit of checking-in, but I typically get a Settebello pizza, unsliced, with spicy oil. The reason for this, and after tasting all of the pizze on the menu, the Settebello has, by far, the best flavor combo if you're into a more savory, earthy flavor in pizza. My favorite in Las Vegas and the US, period. This is what real pizza, not greasy NY or Chicago style bs pizza, should and does taste like.\n",
      "This pizza place is awesome!!! We went on a Wednesday and shared a pizza & salad and had a few glasses of wine. We left having all of that for less than $50 including 20% tip!!! Great service and delicious food! We will be back soon!\n",
      "I love this place because it's the closest to real Italian pizza from Italy not NY! The arugula salad is really good too and so so the tiramisu. This is basically the only place I will order pizza to go from now on.\n",
      "Great pizzas and service. Each pizza are individual size. Just wished they had more choices since they only have 7-8 types of pizza.\n",
      "Where do I start, the pizza... too obvious, ok ok uh, the meat.. Ya ya the meat! The prosciutto is better than any deli I've been to or maybe it's what that 900 degree wood fire oven does to it but it's lovely on my tongue. They don't have pepperoni, what you say, a pizza joint that doesn't have pepperoni is 5 stars? Yes they have a spicy salami and after, you'll wish your pizzeria did too! So yes the food is fantastic, but without the service no matter how good it was you wouldn't come back. They always greet you with a smile, make sure your cup no matter what it is, is always full.\n",
      "Finally got around to trying this place last night. I think we've been holding off because we thought it was going to be expensive, but it really isn't. 2 salads, a pizza and a cocktail came to roughly $40. The food is excellent and the pizza is very different than we're used to but very fresh and delicious (and the sauce is amazing!). The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be. We had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become. We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious. For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great! The atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to. UPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new. We have yet to be disappointed! Everything we've had has been delicious. We've also taken friends and family for the first time who promptly went back again to try other items.\n",
      "Went for happy hour (Monday-friday 8:30-10) and had the best service and the food was delicious! The happy hour menu had a lot to chose from and still had stuff to take home for later.\n",
      "One of the worst pizza places I've ever been to. If you want soup go to sweet tomatoes. Because that's what this pizza is like. Truly a disappointment they should have stayed in Henderson where they belong.\n",
      "Came here with 3 hungry people for our 1st visit. No direction was offered. Ordered crostini appetizer & settebello pizza. Appetizer was basically for 2. Pizza was VERY small & surprisingly extremely soggy. No Parmesan cheese or red peppers on the table or offered. Very shocked as this restaurant came highly recommended & reviewed. Left very disappointed & hungry\n",
      "If you want authentic Italian pizza, the pizza here gives you a product that closely resembles the real thing. Sometimes the pizza is very watery and other times it's right on. I used to live in Italy and I do not remember the basil on the pizza ever being burnt to a crisp, which creates a bad taste. I believe in Italy, they put the basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven. Wish this place would focus on creating a better basic Italian napoletano style pizza which is a high art form when executed correctly.\n",
      "We came here because someone said this is the best pizza joint ever. First, the parking lot is just crazy. It's in the middle of a shopping center and movie theatre in summerlin. We got lucky tonight and found parking right away. It took a few minutes before someone realized we were standing there. Once she greeted us it took at the most about 5 minutes before we were seated. Not long at all. We ordered a mixed green salad and margeretta pizza with no basil. I didn't read the part on the menu that said the salad would only be drizzled with oil. My bad. Had I seen it I would of asked for vinegar. The salad was good. The pizza was on a super thin crust which is what I like. A little crunchy. Fresh tomato sauce. Portion wise wasn't too bad either. We were able to split the pizza and salad between two people and walk out full.\n",
      "Nothing to Write Home To Mama About Please take this with a grain of salt as this is our first visit. Based on the interior of the restaurant, we had high hopes for our first binge meal after five weeks of almost no-carb fasting. The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant. That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table. Quick summation of the meal: Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano. Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish. Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury. So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara. We might visit Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana sometime in the future, but it might take a few months to get the bad taste out of my mouth.\n",
      "Love the pizza but the chef's choice this week was lacking, would have been so much better with more berries and the caprese salad hardly had any basil and tiny tomatoes.\n",
      "I've really come to appreciate VPN style pizza. Because of the high quality ingredients, it truly distinguishes this pizza apart from any other pizzeria. Imported flour from Napoli, San Marzano tomatoes, meats from various American distributers and Buffalo Mozzarella give this place the ingredients to make one hell of a pizza. What we ordered: Arancini appetizer- not the best I've had, but I came here for pizza. Margherita DOC Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Simple yet exquisite. Yes I just used that word to describe pizza. Truly my favorite pizza here. Diavola Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This definitely had a bite to it, I like spicy food, the peppered salame gave it a delicious spice to it. Pizza Carbonara Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Egg, Mozzarella, Cracked Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil My very pizza with egg on it that I liked. I was a bit surprised myself. The oven cooked the egg perfectly to blend with the rest of the ingredients. This was an excellent slice of pie. Settebello Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Still a classic. Along with the DOC, this is a staple when ordering here. Not usually a fan of sausage of pizza, but a total exception to my rule here. Pizza Special: Rafael (different special weekly) Mozzarella, Salame, Roasted Onion, Garlic, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil, Parmigiana, EVOO. Excellent! This was my second favorite pizza sampled that day. Caramel Budino-very sweet, if you like caramel, this is the dessert for you. S'mores Calzone-it was essentially chocolate chips melted within a calzone. Bella Mella-Dessert Pizza was excellent, cinnamon apples and mascarpone was delish. Zeppole-nutella filled donuts. Need I say more? This was my favorite dessert out of the four we tried. For a true hand crafted pizza, this is the place I will come. Being the only VPN certified place in town, Settebello stands out from other pizzerias. Sign up to be on the email list and be notified of their weekly pizza special. *Sidenote, I really wish people would stop complaining about the pizza being undercooked and/or wet. This is what VPN style pizza is, it's not Chicago style, it's not New York style. Grimaldi lovers probably won't appreciate this style of pizza.\n",
      "I discovered Settebello upon moving to the Las Vegas area for work about 7 months ago. I have become a regular! Settebello is an up and coming gem of the Summerlin area. The staff, from the manager, to the bartenders and servers, is friendly, down-to-earth and diligent. The food is amazing. The pizza reminds me of stopping at that random family-owned restaurant along the streets of Florence or Rome. (They have high quality olive oil which is always a tell-tale sign) They have a great wine and cocktail selection. (Best old-fashioned in Vegas, tied with Herbs and Rye) And their Happy Hour tops the whole thing off. This place is really great, I recommend it for everyone, whether its a family dinner or pizza and wine with your friends or significant other.\n",
      "Great Pizza! Gets cold fast but thats when you will enjoy it the most. 5 Stars for the quality of food. Service and beverage selection probably a 4 star. You guys get a 5 star from me!\n",
      "I was excited to check this place out, after reading all the great reviews, but was disappointed. The service was great, but the food not so much. I ordered the Margherita pizza. The appearance was great, but it was extremely greasy and soggy.\n",
      "I was very underwhelmed the second time I visited. Not sure whether it's because we got some of the \"cheaper\" options (the Monday $5 Margarita pizza) and the happy hour pizza...the pizzas left much to be desired. We got the mini sausage pizza on the happy hour menu. They didn't do a good job at all of spreading the cheese evenly on the pizza -- in fact, one slice didn't have any cheese at all!? There was only one piece of basil. The margarita pizza was just as pitiful...the cheese was really only on half the pizza, only one piece of basil (basil is kind of a key part of a margarita pizza!?), and worst of all the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. The pizza -- I mean dough with tomato sauce (and maybe a tiny piece of cheese) -- was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it. We also got drinks. I thought that their mule was fine, but my friend ordered the Old Fashioned and felt like they kind of skimped on that drink. More than half of the drink was a giant ice cube. The one redeeming thing is that their sausage is actually pretty good.\n",
      "Good service, pleasent place for a date, below standard dough. It cant be this hard to make average pizza for $20...\n",
      "My large group enjoyed our time at happy hour here last night. Really good food (the mini pizzas are large enough for a full meal and are only $5 during happy hour!) and drinks make happy guests. The interior is what I would call \"rustic chic,\" with dark wood everywhere. Since the place just opened, service was not perfect (a few orders were misplaced and incorrect drinks were served) but the servers themselves were really nice and quick to correct any oversights. I can see this place becoming a regular venue in my happy hour rotation! Yay for another great place on the west side!\n",
      "This place is a must for real Neapolitan Pizza. We always go during happy hour (3-6 I believe) and get more then one kid size pizza . It's always good . My favorite is Vico, With onions sausage and fennel. Service is fast and everyone is super nice . There is also a map of Naples underground/ train service by the bathroom, found that pretty cool.\n",
      "You may enjoy the atmosphere however on a cold wintry day even in Las Vegas the food does arrive cold. Very similar to the way that the wait staff is. Very unimpressed with their staff. Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience\n",
      "Walked right in and was seated immediately. Staff were prompt and took my order quickly. The atmosphere is very open, and homely as music fills the room. The faint whisps of pizza cooking is faint...smells good....and of course delicious. I'll be back.\n",
      "Ok, without being the stick in the mud, I do admit that I am NOT really a fan of this style pizza. It is supposed to be watery/runny/wet etc, and I don't really like that personally. I've had it a few times, and even recently just to give it one more chance...but it's just not for ME. With that being said, I will review JUST the DESSERTS lol : Zeppole ($5.50): Fried Mini Donuts filled with Nutella & coated w/ Sugar. AMAZING! It doesn't get much better than this guys!! I think about these every so often...I'd come back just for the Zeppole :) Bella Mela ($7): Vanilla Mascarpone, Cinnamon Apples, Caramel Sauce, Powdered Sugar & Almonds. Delicious combination! Loved the crunchy apples and the caramel sauce. Recommended. Caramel Budino ($7): Caramel Pudding, Salted Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream & Almond Orange Cookie. This was very sweet with all the caramel combined together but very tasty! Just beware if you aren't a fan of overly sweet desserts. S'mores Calzone ($7): Filled with Chocolate, Marshmallow & Powdered Sugar. Very sweet...super chocolaty. This was the least favorite dessert out of the 4 we tried. So a cool trendy spot with a specific style of pizza that isn't for everyone...but at least the desserts are yummy!\n",
      "Came in to try out their happy hour. They have two times 3-6 and 830-close. The table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer. There were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4/5) The diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2/5) My favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5/5) Lastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3/5) Although I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!\n",
      "We were in need of a quick bite before seeing a special movie event at the Regal Theatre. We spotted this place and thought we'd give it a try. The wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials. We were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time. The pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a \"bowl\" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing \"Devilish\" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello. We will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!\n",
      "I came here in my attempts to carpe diem on their HH deals. Hence, all orders were limited to their HH menu out of our choice. Pizza Diavola (crushed tomatoes, red bell peppers, spicy salami, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olives) - 3 stars. Pizza Vico (sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella, basil, olives, red onions) - 3 stars. Crostini con crudo (Prosciutto crudo and shaved parmesan) - 2 stars. Crostata ricotta with nutella- 2 stars. I'm generally a fan of a crisp crust, including the bottom having a slight crisp. The pizza was soggy, a bit too soft for my taste, and basically falling apart as soon as it was picked up. I think this could be a matter of preference, but I thought everything we had was OK.\n",
      "Love love love it!! This is the best pizza I've ever had in LV. I mean, I found a super delicious pizza that I really wanted to eat at last!! Thank you for letting me know, My gourmet friends. I would like to eat all kind of Pizza here!! I know that is very greedy, but it is worth to become greedy for this pizza. And Staff is so cheerful and kind and friendly and very thoughtful.We will be back here for sure ASAP!\n",
      "The best Napoletana Pizza. Favorite spot to eat in town I stop by at least once a week. I grab lunch with clients or sometimes for dinner with the whole family. My personal favorite is the Amelia pizza and the Nutella filled zeppolis. Great service and the atmosphere inside is amazing. Go check them out!\n",
      "We ordered two pizzas and neither were spectacular. I had the Settebello and everything kept running off of the pizza because the crust was so soft. Usually I prefer a sturdy crust. I will go back to try it again but my first impression wasn't great.\n",
      "Decor is pretty nice, all of the flavors are there. Although, I got about 2 cloves of sliced garlic on one piece of pizza (about 13 slices) most of the garlic was all in one place. Overall they need to work on quality and quantity control of the food that they produce. They must also work on the art that is pizza.\n",
      "ENVIRONMENT Highly recommended by Italian locals, so this place is legit. The music is horrible, please fix it. Two happy hours, the second starts at 8p APPS Artichoke Crostini -Oh yes. Texas toast thick crostini, very good. Crostini Con Crudo -- the best one! Fully loaded with meat and cheese and a sweet glaze PIZZA -- All the flavored are amazing. The slight burn on the bottom is also great. The only complaint is that the bread is very doughy. Pere E Jalapeño -- WHOA! Not too sweet, not too spicy. A must try, it's one of the best on the menu. Bolognese -- The ragu sauce on this pizza is insanely good. Special of the Week - Not sure what was on this, but order it anyway.\n",
      "Only been here on Mondays with the $5 Margherita pizzas. Those are totally worth it. Not sure if I'd come here on any day but Monday. Pizza itself is wonderful. Thin slices of deliciousness. Love how fast the pizzas come out to the table because they cook them real hot.\n",
      "I tried Settebello for the first time last night. I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good. When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews. He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it. I told him to order it anyway. In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area. I brought it home and it was very good. It was also the perfect size for two people. My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list. And, I want to try some of the others as well. Good service and good pizza!\n",
      "Hands down some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. They make their gluten dough in house, excellent. From NY, been to Italy. I know my pizza. If you want quality go here.\n",
      "Great pizza this one is better than the other one in Pasadena wish this one was in California.\n",
      "Giving a 5 because 6 stars aren't available. For 14 years I've tried to find a pizza like the ones I grew up eating back home in Italy. If you look at my other reviews you can tell I love pizza. The search is over. The first bite sent me back memory lane and I thought I was back home for a second. Not to mention there is a pizzeria in my small hometown of Modugno with the same exact name! The dough, the sauce, the mozzarella, all of it is top notch. Tried the arancini and a salad and they both didn't disappoint. By the time I was leaving I was already planning my next visit.\n",
      "I have been a fan of Settebello for years and was excited that they opened another location closer to my side of town. I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts. We started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates. Luckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though. As a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits.\n",
      "I went with a large group of girls (about 10-12) for happy hour prior to seeing a movie. The happy hour is very well priced and the drinks/food are delicious. I had an Old Fashioned which was pretty good and only $5. We ordered a few mini pizzas and an artichoke crostini. The crostini was pretty basic and kinda tasted like artichoke from a can slapped on to some toast with goat cheese. The mini pizzas were excellent. Perfect char on the crust from the brick oven and the sauces/cheeses were well blended. The service however was lacking. It was apparent the first few minutes of arrival that the staff was struggling with the amount of people in the bar area...we were the bulk of the people in the bar. The waitress took all of our orders but didn't write anything down. Sadly, she had to return to confirm what was ordered but didn't want more than one person talking at a time. She then starting making drinks as well while another person was behind the bar not doing much of anything. Next time, write things down and nudge your co-worker to help you out.\n",
      "We were there last night for dinner....hadn't been in awhile. We both forgot how good the food is here! Great classic cocktails....particularly the Manhattan and Moscow Mule. We had an incredible salad and the Settebello Pizza.....really excellent....nice place. Service is also very nice.\n",
      "Real Italian pizza (Naples style. Other places in Italy make it thinner and more crusty). The quality of ingredients is unbelievable (the prosciutto is so sweet, Parma style, the tasty mozzarella, the fresh tomatoes). They size of the pizza could be bigger. The service? Great! Same as food. Mariana was so nice and kind. She made our evening so comfortable and enjoyable. We really appreciated her. The price is ok considering the quality.\n",
      "Just had Happy Hour there again. Never disappoint. We had pizza, Arancini, warm beets and misto for my little daughter and I. Of course we had way too much food. But the bread was too amazing. Everything else was just a bonus. 2 drinks on top of all the food, under $40. (Before 6pm weekday). Staffs were friendly. My 4 year old loved her pizza. I enjoyed my wine and food. Win win win. Please come try.\n",
      "I love the Happy Hour menu but the service just continues to get worse and worse. Their reverse happy hour is from 8-9 pm, and on the last two times I've gone, I arrived with some friends at 8:25. The server Tricia literally greeted the table by saying \"You know you have 10 minutes to order right?\". How about Good evening! Welcome to Settebello! Can I get some drinks started for you? Lol. Didn't check on us once and we had to ask the busser to order another round of drinks. I get you want to leave, but it's just plain rude. There's plenty of good happy hours in the area with great food AND service, don't go where they obviously don't want the business.\n",
      "After hearing good things about the place, my friend and I went on a Monday night to try out their handcrafted pizzas. The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask. When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each... Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Vico, which was basically a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it was surprisingly very filling despite it being a very thin-crust pizza. Long story short - good food, subpar service.\n",
      "If you like super thin pizza in a brick oven with fresh great ingredients you should definitely come here .\n",
      "I like the ambiance inside, kind of dark, cool lighting, chairs, and decorations. We came with a party of 18 and sat in the back private room, which was very nice. The waiter was a little confused and would take a couple orders, then leave, then come back, then give some people pizza before he even finished getting everyone's orders. The food-pizza was gooey and soft in the middle making it hard to pick up (sloppy) and hard to cut (falls apart). I am not sure how you eat this pizza correctly! :)Crust was just right. We had the Setebello pizza and it was good but I would get something else next time. The friends I was with ordered desserts and although I did not try them, they looked amazing!\n",
      "We've been coming here almost weekly since a couple of years now...the place is beautifully furnished, great atmosphere, always clean, and we've never had problems with the service.. the staff is very attentive and friendly.. Sometimes the bartender brings our drinks the moment we sit down because he remembers what we like. The pizza is as authentic Italian as it gets! Thumbs up! Their gluten free crust is also incredible, you can hardly tell you aren't having the real thing.. Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas, and most of the salads are delicious too! Great selection of and too.\n",
      "Love this place! They have delicious pizza. The meat and cheese sampler plates are delectable. I have been here at least a dozen times since the first time I tried it. For a pizza place they are a little on the high end, but the atmosphere and product are great. The lunch special and the happy hour are a great way to try the place on the cheap ($5 for pizza during happy hour). This is one place that I keep in my restaurant rotation.\n",
      "Stopped by to use my free pizza coupon and get some food on happy hour!!! Our server bethanie was super nice and was very attentive and knowledgable. The staff were also very polite. The interior of this place was sooo upscale and absolutely beautiful. Their happy hour is incredible. 5$ Moscow mules.... You can steal my money everyday. Their carbonara pizza was sooooo amazing! Me and my BF killed all of it. Their happy hour meat and cheese plate was super good, and their mini pizzas were great! Our bill only came out to 30 something $ which is a steal. I will definitely be coming back and blowing all of my money here! Can't wait to try all of the pizzas!\n",
      "Best pizza in town! Felt like I was back in Italy. We had the Margarita Doc and added mushrooms. Also got the Panzaneta salad (not sure how to spell it). Loved the ambiance and decor. Will definitely be back. Love love love!!!\n",
      "The food here is good but not great. The pizza is always soggy in the middle, no matter the topping. The outer crust is perfect, chewy and a little dense. I'm flummoxed as to why they use arugula as the only green in their salads. I have been to Settebello in UT, CA and this location twice. I keep trying to give them another shot but they always fall short. The problem is the service. I have never been asked if I would like dessert or coffee, and I do want both. I am a middle aged average looking Caucasian woman. Usually dining out with the hubby or friends. I like to enjoy my meals out. It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw. Eric, our waiter, seemed like he couldn't get us out the door fast enough. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and when we did he brought our check. No dessert and no more Settebello. Someone at corporate needs to make sure the wait staff is trained properly.\n",
      "Mariana is absolutely fantastic. She's the true definition of service. I will return just to see her. Wonderful service and food\n",
      "I love the innovative bar program. And the broccili rabe crostini.\n",
      "Delicious food, flavorful cocktails and a nice happy hour menu but service lacked. We grabbed a couple chairs in the bar area before heading over to see a movie and made it in time for their happy hour which is from 3-6pm. We were a group of 12 women but we came in groups of four with 20 minute increments in between our arrivals. We ordered a few personal pizzas, an artichoke crostini and a couple craft cocktails including a mint Collins, basil gimlet and Moscow mule that were each $5. They have a wide variety on their happy hour menu with lots of different choices. Everything we drank and ate was awesome. The char on the pizza crust that they get from the wood fired oven was perfect. Chewy texture with a little crunch on their crust. The artichoke crostini had slices of prosciutto, large pieces of marinated artichoke and and ricotta. You can't beat the price on the craft cocktails either! Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was overwhelmed when our group came in and never wrote anything down. She would then come back and ask what we ordered every time she took an order. At one point two girls spoke up and she snapped back, you both can't talk to me I can only handle one person at a time. She clearly needed help but no one else came to assist her. Next time write things down. One of my friends waited 20 minutes for a water! Cocktails and food all came at different times even when orders were given to her at the same time. I'm giving it four stars instead of two or three because the food and drinks were good.\n",
      "Been going to both locations for about 10 years. Pizza is excellent. It is 'soggy' in the middle but the crust is chewy, charred, and crispy. It is delicious. My fave is the Settebello without pancetta. Yummy and satisfying. The pancetta makes it too salty and heavy. They also have great cocktails. Usually get the Miguel Douglas. Had the barbershop medicine and it was delicious.\n",
      "Spectacular food and great wine list. Food was prepared very well and you can tell it was fresh! But downside....the bartenders are EXTREMELY SLOW. We walked in and there was a 10-15 minute wait..no worries! So my family and I went over to the bar to get a drink while we waited. Here's the catch by the time we got our drinks we were already seated. We are talking 20 minutes here... But listen great food amazing atmosphere I always see someone I know when I go and I highly recommend it! It just takes a while to get drink! Haha\n",
      "They now have happy hour, it's an added bonus! This place is close to our home and has delicious margerita pizza, which is what drives us in every time! The service can vary from bad to good; last time our waitress hardly showed at our table but today our waiter checked in on us three times -showing improvement!!!!\n",
      "Pizza I ordered sucked return to waitress I ordered only meat pizza sausage Didn't notice it was white sauce and broccoli .....disgusting ....terrible , wife ordered magahrita pizza loved it so it was just mine and bad taste...... Service sucked\n",
      "I'm glad to see that they expanded the appetizer section of the menu from my last visit. The artichoke crostini with speck and goat cheese was great, nicely toasted bread with appropriate chew and moisture. Beet salad and meatballs were awesome as usual. Did the pizza of the week, and was not disappointed. Just need the busser to clear plates and glasses between courses more regularly, it adds up quickly when they are this good!\n",
      "Had an awesome late lunch delicious pizza, cozy place. Ordered charcuterie plater good wine selections. Food was on point!\n",
      "One of my favorite (non Chicago deep dish) pizza spots. The staff here is great. Always friendly and on point. It has a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere, which you notice right when you walk in. The pizza is a traditional Neapolitan style. They have a good variety of pizzas, and have a special pizza of the week. (Which hasn't let me down yet!) There is a very nice bar with a great selection of beers and cocktails. Not to big, but perfect size for a small group to unwind after work. Plus, two happy hours: 3:00p-6:00p and 8:30-to close, Mon-Fri. So if you're looking for a great pizza, friendly staff and a place to relax at an affordable price, try Settebello.\n",
      "It's been said that, \"Time is money, money is power, power is pizza, and pizza is knowledge, let's go!\" Settabello is the place to go to...absolutely where it's at for Napoletana style pizza! IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't like Napoletana style pizza that is typically eaten with a knife and fork because it is chewy/wet/runny/soggy in the center then don't eat here. It's not their fault if they serve their product correctly. Settebello uses fresh, high-quality ingredients...they cook their pizza in wood burning ovens...they have an approachable wine list with lovely options...they have great salads and desserts to start and finish your meal with! Include a clean, welcoming environment, and Settabello is an easy \"Good as it Gets\" 5 Stars! My favorite pizzas are the following: Margherita DOC Diavola Pizza Carbonara Settebello Bianca I belong to runny egg yolks anonymous due to my addiction/infatuation for the golden spheres of flamboyant goodness that are egg yolks. Settebello does their Pizza Carbonara with a runny yoked egg on top. What's more? You can ask to have a runny egg atop any of their pizzas. I suggest experiencing the Diavola this way...you could also do the Settebello or Bianca this way, but even an addict such as me would leave the Margherita & M. DOC alone. Settebello is easily my vote for best Napoletana pizza in Vegas, but they might be my favorite pizza in Vegas of any style.\n",
      "I spy a big pizza pie in your eye!!! (pointing finger)... There being several choices of eateries within Village Square, we happened upon Settebello with front door parking. It must've been a silent invite. Good to see it's not crazy busy. We were seated within a minute of walking in. Quickly, snapped a photo of the funny happy hour chalkboard. Got seated at a booth and flip page menus were left on the table to view. So glad it wasn't confusing. But with all the flavors and ingredients, it took a moment to decide. Let's just start with ice waters and a pitcher of white sangria. Perfect pick on the white sangria to bring out our cheerful sides hahaaa. Wine glasses are $5 during happy hour which is 'til 9pm on Thursdays. Now we know to order by glass instead of pitcher for happy hour. We tempted our taste buds with artichoke crostini; followed with Settebello pizza. It was described with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. OMG that was great! It wasn't so much the thin crust cuz it was soft; usually not my preference. But if anything has flavor scores, for me I just be quiet and GRUB. I had no expectations trying this place out, and the food has me starry eyed. Okay maybe the sangria was a booster. Interior is beautifully designed. I love the reused wood tables, and the mix of metals and stones. It's modern but they use a brick oven for their pizzas and you can actually watch them being made. There's bar stool seating around it for closer observation. Need to give Matt, our server, applauded acknowledgment for his polite attentive customer service too. They have a separate bar area where sports fanatics can watch and consume. The environment overall felt comfortable to chill and relax with the warm colors of the furniture and fixtures. At the same time Ness and I felt like we were in the spotlight, on our stage. We were only having a catch up conversation. Recommending Settebello for any reason cuz the food is really flavorful! Will return to try other pizzas. Also, cuz their white sangria causes laughter spurts. And we love to laugh :D\n",
      "We were incredibly impressed with the service we recived from this neighborhood pizzaria this evening. We didn't realize they closed at 9 when we went in for dinner at 8:40 p.m. tonight. We were offered food to go and gladly accepted it. There were four of us, my daughter and I split a panzanella salad and a pizza that had jalapeño in the name, I wish I could recall the exact name, it was excellent. It had jalapeño jelly, mozzarella, red onion, an Italian ham and basil. So spicy and delicious! My husband and my son-in-law both loved their pizzas also. We will return when we have time to enjoy the nice atmosphere of the dining room and more of their great customer service.\n",
      "Our family has a pizza place that we usually go to but one evening we decided to try something new. I heard great things about Settebello so that was where we headed. The restaurant has a dim romantic vibe to it, which didn't really suit us that evening since we had our 4 year old. I ordered a caprese salad that was delicious but nothing I couldn't make at home. My bf got us an appetizer to share. It was delicious, but I had recently got my braces put on, so hard crusty bread was not my friend. I had a SMALL bite of it and from what I remember, it was delicious. I believe it had artichoke, prosciutto, and ricotta (?) I forget all the toppings that his pizza included, but I DO remember that the center of each pizza (our son got a regular, kid-sized, cheese pizza) was soggy :( The sauce was delicious but a little too thin. The service was quaint and I remember our waitress mixing the two juices that our son couldn't decide on together, which he thought was pretty neat. I don't know if we'll be back only because we've already got a favorite pizza place, but the experience was nice.\n",
      "Where do I begin? Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center. I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant. We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautéed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed. Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and \"chewy\" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up. Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon.\n",
      "Pizza is wonderful... Coffee is terrible Service is Terrible Great Place and Location... They need to improve on their product and get a whole new crew. Coffee in Italy is wonderful... Bad duplicate. Waiters need to wash hands & quit holding onto their personal cell phones. Not a place for that... Owners are sweet. You need to watch your investment closer. Good Luck...\n",
      "This Settebello location is absolutely impressive when it comes to the interior. Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away. Their pizzas come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well. I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis. Bombolinis, beignets, donuts, whatever... I love!\n",
      "Settebello, you let me down! There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner. Of course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust. Without the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share. The second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face. While not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana.\n",
      "One of my favorite places in Summerlin. Andy and I come here often and have loved each expedience. Located in the Village Square shopping center right by the movie theater, there is tons of parking so its very convenient. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their Italian Panini (not on the menu but ask your server/bartender about it) Its huge so I suggest sharing it! Also when were in the mood for pizza we get the Diavola, Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. AMAZING! it has a kick so its not for those who dont like spice. Josh the GM is great. He makes our dining exp so much more enjoyable then anywhere else we frequent. I highly recommend this hidden gem!\n",
      "I want to eat here every week. By far, Settebello makes my favorite wood fired pizza in Vegas. Definitely above average. They've had some great special pizzas of the week but their Margherita DOC is always the best. Besides pizza, the rest of their food is good to average- the pizza outshines the rest of the menu for me. The bar and cocktails are well above average. The wine list is good. The service is always great. Overall, one of my favorite spots in town.\n",
      "Great thin crust pizza. Nicely charred a bit on bottom as it should be. You have to try the Pear and Jalapeno jam pizza. You only get it in this location and it's amazing. it sounds weird, but it's an amazing flavor combination. I also love their Pizza Capricciosa. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad are very good too. One of the best things though, is their Panna Cotta dessert. Perfect consistency, not overly sweetened and has a nice added touch with the Strawberry and Balsamic on top. Décor is rustic and spacious with a \"generous\" feel to it. Service is very good as well. We've been there many times and got served by different people but it was always great and friendly service.\n",
      "I love this pizza. Especially the Margherita! The pizza is fresh, made-to-order and the dough is so soft and delicious. If you can make it for Happy Hour or Margherita Monday, you won't be able to beat the price!\n",
      "I love this style of pizza. Happy Hour deals are great. Food comes quick, the beer is cold, what more can you ask for?\n",
      "This is really REALLY good pizza! It is different in that it is more European and rustic than the typical American sliced pizza. The crust is different too. It is really fluffy in the edges and the inside is really thin. This makes eating it a little messy but totally worth it. Their pizza is traditionally served unsliced and you eat it by tearing off little bits. Good fun if you are having your own pizza. If you are sharing or don't want to be a mess they will slice them up for you! Here are some of the pizzas that I have tried so far: 1) Settebello: This is the name of the restaurant, how can you go wrong? It has crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushroom, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. It is like an everything pizza. So good. If I had to choose one to be my favorite, this would be it. 2) Pizza Carbonara: Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, eggs, mozarella, pepper, olive oil. The eggs are mixed in with the chesse. This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good. 3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil. Excellent and tasty white pizza. The creamy consistency is delicious. 4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil. The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious. Basically all the pizzas are really good. The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion. For dessert the Bella Mella: apple with caramel, vanilla mascarpone, and almonds was the best. We tried the nutella pizza (so-so) and the nutella filled donuts. The apple pie was the best by far. Come here for some great pizza and a food coma shortly to follow. I fell asleep right after and didn't wake up to brush my teeth or shower until 6am. It is powerful pizza.\n",
      "We love going to this place. It's one of our laid back date night chill spots. The pizza is freshly made in a classic open stone pizza oven. The Napoletana style Pizza is thin crust but really nice and moist comes out steaming. We love the Diavolo which is the peppered salami. There's also a nice but small selection of wine and beer. It's a mellow warm atmosphere with friendly attentive wait staff.\n",
      "We went to this restaurant a while back and I have to say this place is a huge disappointment, when we went and we were seated at a table that was in a corner we were with our three kids my wife and my mother and the table was too small it also slid all over the concrete floor which sucked They notified us upon being seated that their credit card machine wasn't going to work which just created a lot of hassle and inconvenience I ordered my pizza without any artichoke hearts and of course when it arrived it had artichoke hearts I didn't bother sending it back because it wasn't even worth doing, the other issue was that they don't give you any fair warning about the pepperoni that they use on their pizza for kids pepperoni that pepperoni was really spicy and the kids wouldn't eat it . They should say something and tell you that before you order it. The food is overpriced for what you get and the ingredients themselves including the crust and everything else is just a low quality compared to other restaurants that occupy this sort of sector / case in point would be due forni which smokes this place, you shouldn't even bother to go here, worth it and I'll never come here again while duo forni is open, don't be fooled\n",
      "The atmosphere was on point, and the staff were great. Overall, the food was of good quality. However, the pizza was boring. It lacked flavor is the best way to put it. The only flavor that stood out was that of burning fire, like a marshmallow without the deliciousness of a mallow. I also enjoy my pizza crust crisp or at least the opposite of soggy. However, that's this style of pizza-- doughy in the center. I won't be returning and not because of the service. The pizza was really that uneventful.\n",
      "This place is awesome! You can always plan on an authentic Italian dining experience here. Fresh salads, pizza & cocktails. You can't go wrong coming to Settebello!!\n",
      "Me and my wife love this place. We order all the antipasti . She loves the artichoke crostini. I love the prosciutto involtini . My kids love the pizza. The pizzas are soft and charred the way the chef indented. Its a different style than the NYC pizza.\n",
      "Really good pizza cooked in a very hot oven. Top shelf add ons. Authentic ingredients. Gr8 salads and appetizers. Cool bar w/outstanding bar menu. Serviear movir movies.es.ce was good. Reasonable prices. Industrial ambience. Near movie theaters.\n",
      "I like coming to this place but I forget... the food is good but the service is crappie. :-/ Tyler is awesome!\n",
      "My brother and I stumbled upon this place on a Friday night looking for a place to eat open past 9pm, and we were not disappointed. When we went it happened to be happy hour, and most food and beverage items on the happy hour menu were $5. So we ordered 3 mini pizzas, and a fritta (fried calzone), and 2 beers. The pizzas were very good, we got the diavola, the vico and the margherita. I didn't love the fritta, and would have preferred a normal calzone, but my brother really liked the texture of the fried calzone dough and thought it was unique. In short, I would go back again for the great happy hour deals.\n",
      "We are absolutely furious with the pizza makers. They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt. And of course Augustine was not the cook. If you like burned pizzas this is the place for you.\n",
      "Let me start by saying that Josh in fantastic. He took care of my husband and I for the evening, and everything he brought to the table was spot on. He was knowledgeable and passionate, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. For starters my husband and I had a platter with toasted bread, prosciutto, mozzarella buffalo, and tomatoes in basil. We topped one topping on the next, and it was to die for. It wasn't even on the menu, so I can't remember what it is called! My husband had an Old Fashioned and he said it was the best one of his life. Next, we both dove into some pies. My husband got the diavvolo (spelling?) and I got a pizza with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and salami. Both pizzas were incredible, but my husband's was spicier and more full of flavor. The crust is thin, doughy in the center, and the crust dipped into the red pepper olive oil is the best thing in the whole world. For dessert, I had the traditional tiramisu, and my husband tried the strawberry and crema dessert. Both were heavenly. We asked Josh throughout the meal to pair up our food with adult beverages, and each time he was spot on. We cannot wait to go back! The best pizza in town. In fact, my husband said the pizza was better than when he was in Italy. Well done, Settebello!\n",
      "We have two cats - one of which we adopted from Banks. We've always had great experiences with them, and find all of the staff and vets helpful and friendly. Dr. Featherstone always has great tips for keeping our kitties happy and healthy. We had our cat spayed there, and she had some complications with the stitches. Turns out she was allergic to the stitches themselves. The staff were so great about keeping us calm and our cat comfortable through the ordeal. She healed up fine after re-stitching with a different type of suture. We live pretty far from them now, but still trek out 30+ minutes to take our kitties there.\n",
      "We brought our geriatric dog here when our regular vet wasn't able to see her due to a temporary staff shortage. Our old girl had a large abscess that had started to drain, and needed to be looked after. The staff seemed very compassionate and knowledgeable, even though we were squeezed in last minute and ended up staying past closing hours. They took very good care of our 15 year old pup, and, although not pretty to look at, her abscess has been drained, shaved, and she's been put on antibiotics for 2 weeks. The vet was caring, *definitely* knowledgeable, and very patient with us and with Dixie... even with our 4 year old, who wouldn't sit still for love nor money! If we ever need a \"back-up\" vet (they're a bit far for us to travel to on a regular basis), they're the ones we'll be calling on!\n",
      "My cat came to me as a foster in 2008. In Spring 2009, he was starting to go outside his box and had trouble urinating. He clearly had a UTI and it was dire. You can't mess around with male cats and UTIs. So, Annex Cat Rescue sent me to this clinic and I got the horrendous experience of dealing with Dr. Ron Pousong. He had to be coaxed into doing blood/urine testing. He told me the (fixed) cat \"probably saw another cat outside and got excited\" and wasn't actually sick. Yes, he was twitterpated - OK sure! When the results came back, he was very wishy-washy about the medication that would be required. He started yelling at me on the phone when I questioned his approach and insisted he get the meds ready for same day pick up. There were many ways to treat this condition and his solution was to give me 21 teeny tiny pills to shove down the cat's throat daily for 3 weeks. The meds didn't work. He needed stronger ones on a shorter course. Eventually, he got the care he needed elsewhere. My cat also got fleas while there, but they'll deny it til they're blue in the face. Don't. Ever. Go. Here.\n",
      "Had such a horrible experience with the female Veterinarian on staff, that I am thisclose to lodging a complaint against her with the OVMA. Never, in almost 20 years of caring for my dogs, have I ever been treated in this manner. Never again. Banks Animal Hospital has lost a family of customers. 3 homes with a menagerie of dogs and cats. Shame on you.\n",
      "They lost my friends dog, then neglected to tell them for HOURS. Still no explanation. Thankfully Winni was found.\n",
      "If you want to take your pet to a vet office that doesnt give a crap about your pet take them here. I have had many bad experiences with this office with my mom's dogs and I am pretty sure this place is more expensive than other vets. The older doctor is a real douche. My mom's older dog became quite sick with artheritis and he was prescribed meta cam. The vet scared me into thinking it was a spinal tumor (because he knew I work in a human neurosurgery unit in a hospital) and said that the dog needed all sorts of expensive tests (X-ray under sedation, blood work etc) and it would all cost like $700+. I left crying because my moms dog was so sick and in pain he was shaking from the pain. Later he was prescribed METACAM for his pain and my mother sent me down there from her home to pick it up for her while she stayed with the dog who was in really bad shape. My mom though because her credit card was on file and her dogs had been patients at Banks for 10+ years that it wouldnt be a huge issue to give the $79 metacam to me. But it was. They refused to issue the medication to me without payment on the spot and wouldnt run the credit card even by talking to her on the phone. So I had to drive back to her house pick her up and bring her down all while the dog is in agony at home. The receptionist said \"i'll check with the doctor\" and the older gentleman refused to give the medication without payment, something which had been done before with a different vet at the same place. It's not even like it wouldnt have been paid for my mother was willing to drive down right after to give them the money we were more concerned with not leaving the dog alone in agony which this vet didnt care about. I've heard other bad things about this office so I'd take my pet elsewhere. I take my cat to Queen West Animal Hospital. If thats out of area for you (which it is for my mom) then I'd maybe go to the Leslieville Animal Hospital or anywhere but here. These people don't care about your pet. They care about money.\n",
      "First of all, all vet clinics care about making money - it's a business after all. Secondly, I've had some negative experiences with vets before (Rosedale and Annex hospitals being the WORST), but I've never had a bad interaction with anyone at Banks. They have always been understanding of my dog's needs and sensitive to my neuroses. They never push on medications or services, but will make recommenations and suggestions. We would often go for their grooming services and Mr. Scamper would come running out excited, all clean and fresh, with a fancy bandana tied around his neck. I don't even live in the east end anymore, but we still drive all the way out there because that is Scamper's vet. I also find their pricing reasonable and on par, or below, with those in other areas of the city.\n",
      "my puppy came here for his 2nd set of shots, perfectly healthy, they decided to redo his first shots instead.... some bullshit about they were done too early...within a week he got sick... so we went back... he had localized demodex... so he gave us meds and sent us on our way... back a week later because it got worse and spread. now its generalized demodex meaning it spread everywhere, also told us he couldnt have his 2nd shots because he was sick... ok fine... also said he needed to see a dermatologist which could take a month to get an appointment. gave us more meds then sent us on our way again. he calls me back 2 days later saying he can actually give the 2nd shots... and to come back for more meds...wait didnt you say you cant vaccinate a sick dog??? we decided to go to a different vet... apparently the \"meds\" arent for demodex and giving him his first shots twice lowered his immune system. thank you you incompetent fool. were now looking at 6 months of treating our puppy and weekly vet visits. do not EVER go to this vet.\n",
      "I loved this place. Mom was recently discharged from a month and a half of rehab after an illness. It's not a nursing home so it doesn't have a nursing home feel. It's more like being in a hotel. The food was good, the employees were always friendly and helpful. After our experience with rehab four years ago in another facility, I was leary of her going in again. I can say that this was a good experience and my mom was happy.\n",
      "This is a terrific rehabilitation center. After my Dad had hip surgery, he needed a place to heal and get strong again. Sante of Chandler was it! It looks like a Marriott Residence Inn but nicer! Great, kind and caring staff, comfortable private rooms, and good food. I slept well at night knowing he was in safe care and he was very happy with his stay there.\n",
      "There are good things and bad things about Sante of Chandler. YOU MUST BE VERY VERY INVOLVED AND DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING FOR YOU LOVED ONE. DON'T ASSUME THEY ARE ON THE BALL AND WILL HANDLE EVERYTHING. The good things: The rooms/facility are extremely nice and clean. Patients don't have to share a room with another person. They have a great dining room and really good food. Nurses and Aids are prompt at responding when you ring the call button for assistance. The physical and occupational therapy was outstanding and got my mom stronger and stronger by the day. The bad things: On call doctors who won't return calls after hours when patient is in pain. Doctors who won't ok over-the-counter aspirin for mom's pain even when she only needed it once a week or so and had no reason she should not take it. (She doesn't have kidney issues or other reasons you wouldn't take aspirin, Tylenol doesn't help.) By mistake they sent my mom's medical records with another patient to her off campus doctor's appointment and sent the other patients medical records with my mom to her doctor's appointment. They scheduled my mom an appointment with a specialist who does not take my mom's insurance. The drivers who take patients to their doctor appointments never arrive in time unless you have someone get them on the phone just in the nick of time. They often have a slightly wrong address in their phone GPS and take the patient to the wrong address. A psych nurse requests medications be given which are contraindicated with the current medications mom was taking. (Floor nurse discovered this and refused to give the medication thankfully.) After each of these issues I notified the director John and each time he said would personally handle mom's case. So much for that. The staff is terrific and caring, it the training and management that needs different procedures and to train people better.\n",
      "My best friend has been in this facility for about 2 weeks for rehab for a neuro issue that requires physical therapy and occupational therapy daily. Seems to cater to Medicare patients. Here are my observations from visiting her frequently and asking her what she thinks of this place. Pros: New clean facility, nicely decorated, staff is responsive to call lights. The PT facilities and cafe are very nice. Only one patient per room. Flat panel TV, fridge and microwave in each room. Cons. Like most skilled care and rehab facilities in AZ, I never saw an RN. Most care is from nursing assistants (graduates of 1 month training programs). They have LPNs (Licensed Practical Nurses with one year of training) in charge and giving the meds instead of registered nurses. When my friend declined to take one of the routine meds, I saw the LPN reach into the dispensing cup with her bare hand to remove the med that my friend did not want to take. That means she touched all of the meds in the cup with her bare hand. That is a big infection control no-no. Overall, an OK place if you need daily physical therapy and occupational therapy and are not in good enough health to make the commute each day. My friend is really looking forward to getting back to her own home.\n",
      "Same as Jo Ann review 10 days ago. Rarely checked in on my Dad. Also got a UTI. Sent to hospital and Sante discharged my dad on a Friday at 2:00pm, holiday weekend, and never called us! My mom figured it out when she went back to his room at 5 to get some things while he was in hospital. We figured we'd be going back to Sante. Nope. Discharged because he wasn't progressing enough, after they told us they would make this decision the following Tuesday. Sent my mothers BP through the roof. We asked case worker why she didn't call mom to tell her that dad had been discharged....she said they have a lot of patients. Very traumatic experience for our family\n",
      "LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!! Beautiful facility but AWFUL care. I am a pharmacist and visited many rehab facilities for my mother. Sante drew me in because of the looks. What a mistake. My mother was in the facility for a broken hip. The nursing staff is HORRIFIC!!! They were refusing to call the md to get my mom pain meds her first night there. Sofie the rn on duty argued with me for a half hour as my mom lay clenching the bed sheets due to excruciating pain. Sofie insisted the pain meds my mom was on was all she needed, even though she was getting additional morphine every 2 hours around the clock in the hospital. The rn had no empathy or compassion for her. Had I not spent the night with my mom and fought for her, the nursing staff would not have assisted her with her pain. The nurses also let her go 10 days without a bowel movement. My mom was nauseus and hadnt eaten in 10 days due to this problem. Nobody did a thing the few times I mentioned my concern. Only when I contacted another md and found out my mom could have fecal impaction and perforate her bowels and threatened to call 911 and have her removed from Sante did the nurses FINALLY contact an md about her situation. The nurses didn't even follow their own protocol for constipation and give her something as simple as Milk of Magnesia up to this point. There are numerous other lack of care situations that occured in the 12 days...nobody checked in on her for more than 6 hours, nobody cared she hadnt eaten in 10days, medication was given at various times instead of on schedule or with food as instructed. I WOULD AVOID THIS FACILITY. I spent every night for 12 days with my mom and witnessed the lack of basic medical care first hand. Once you are there they have you at their mercy because if you leave on your own Medicare will not pay.\n",
      "This place is like a Hilton Hotel no kidding. 1. Their Chef ( not a cook) ...Chef Miller made a point to make my mother the kind of food she could eat and that she liked to eat. That was important to her recovery from surgery. Her illness had left her weak and she lost 75 lbs in one year. She has many food allergies and all the other place she was including the hospital sent up food she was severely allergic to. He made real mashed potatoes, real turkey from a turkey breast as well as the best darn grilled cheese with two kinds of real cheese and real butter the kind my mom (she) would make. 2. The rooms are cheerful and bright no hospital smell. Real carpet no linoleum here. A private shower, the newspaper delivered daily to her room. No kidding it was like a Hilton. There was a hair salon there that gave her a beautiful cut and style that was needed after an 8 week stay in the hospital. 3. The nursing staff was excellent! She is not always a peach to deal with when sick and weak, but they all were kind and compassionate. They had physical therapy every day and her recovery was quick. I know that her stay at Sante was the experience she needed for her physical as well as mental health. I am so grateful to the staff at Sante for taking such good care of my mom. FYI it does take Medicare. If you find yourself needing a place for rehab this would be the one to choose. We were at two others and to say the least.... they stunk literally and figuratively speaking.\n",
      "My 86 y.o. Dad went to Sante for rehab after a fall and shoulder fracture. Unfortunately, Sante fell short in what I feel are the basic requirements a \"Skilled Nursing Facility\" should possess. Dad received minimal \"rehab\" for which they blamed him \"you are not progressing.\" My chief complaints are as follows: 1) Patient developed a UTI while in Sante and almost a week passed before he was given antibiotics for the infection. 2) Patient was severely dehydrated and his fluid intake was not being monitored by staff (No one checking to make sure he was drinking enough water). They mentioned they \"could administer an IV\" but that never happened. 3) Patient was transported to a Dr's appointment in 35-40 degrees temps without a coat, jacket or even a blanket wrapped around him.) 4) Patient's food consumption was not monitored and Dad lost 10 pounds over 2 weeks on the \"cake and ice cream diet\". 5) The staff moved the bed down real low and when we inquired about it, were told Dad was a \"fall risk\" and later learned he had fallen from the bed. 6) Housekeeping (dirty linens, etc. left in the room, we had to remove them ourselves). 7) Most of the staff providing the care are NA's and students who did not appear to be trained in how to get someone with a shoulder fracture and limited mobility out of bed. 8/9) Long wait times when patient pressed call button. Not friendly, at times sarcastic nursing staff. If you complain they turn it on you as though it's your fault. Gosh I could go on and on. It was difficult to speak to the Coordinator (RN) in charge of my Dad's care. She seemed too busy to sit down for 2 minutes and discuss our concerns about Dad. She didn't return my calls either, even when my message said \"this is urgent.\" I do not recommend Sante.\n",
      "he place is nice and clean. The PT and OT seemed to do a good job. There are a few downsides 1) It is almost impossible to get a person to call you back. I was calling and they would pick up the phone and hang up. I went in, sat in the lobby and watched to see what happened. She did answer in front of me. 2) Jennifer, the social worker is inept. If you are able to pin her down to talk to her her standard answer is either \"I have a brochure for that\" or \"a telephone number for that\". Her knowledge is extremely limited, so don't count on any help from them. I was very frustrated, until I finally realized she just doesn't have an understanding of what the clientele needs. She is not proactive and cannot help with anything. Look elsewhere for help. 3) The case manager is also inept. They explained that unless she did PT and OT, Medicare wouldn't pay and they would discharge her. But her pain from the breaks was horrific. Luckily, her doctor came in and changed the pain medication. She was able to tolerate the pain and make progress. Do not look to the case manager for any help. Look outside.\n",
      "My mom has been in Sante of Chandler for four days now. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful. The therapists are sure to do what they can to strengthen her daily. I'll update this review after she has completed her rehab. At this point, nothing could be better. Very nice facility, restaurant and accommodations.\n",
      "My mom stayed about a week at Sante of Chandler after a major surgery and was impressed. The staff made her feel well cared for, and the rooms were clean and comfortable.\n",
      "My father in-law just spent seven weeks at Sante of Chandler and it was a wonderful experience! He went in on a stretcher with a feeding tube and left without needing the tube and just days away from no longer needing the wheelchair! We were skeptical about going into skilled nursing but I toured places in the area and read the health department reports and determined that Sante of Chandler was going to be the best option for him. Sante of Chandler has not had any bad marks (discrepancies) in years from the health department, NOT ONE! The health department can ding them for the smallest thing (I read one from another company that they were given a bad mark because they had a social event with ice cream and the server walked away from the ice cream and the lid was off!) so this is quite an accomplishment. We did not run into one person at Sante of Chandler that we felt shouldn't be serving the guests. I saw a lot of professional people working really hard at getting folks back on their feet. My father in-law was treated with respect, dignity and allowed to make choices when he could. We did have a couple of little bumps while there but I went to the case manager, Pam, and she handled them with a smile. I felt comfortable leaving my loved one with them and knew they would take care of him like I would. We had several meals in the restaurant and the food was really very good. I don't know why but I wasn't expecting that! I was happy that we had a set menu (strawberry chicken salad is so good!) but also offered daily specials. My father in-law started out with food restrictions, which the restaurant handled with ease. I want to mention also that we had a day when his feeding tube clogged, only twice in 7 weeks, so hats off to Sante of Chandler! The first time it was simple for them to fix but the second time they thought maybe we should have it replaced. One of the nurse, Jennifer, asked if she could take a look at it and was able to unclog it herself and thus saving my father in-law from, what could have been, a painful procedure! We thought that was just amazing! She was just one of the caring and dedicated nurses at Sante of Chandler. There are so many people there that are fantastic and we really do miss them. We were there for 7 weeks so we formed bonds. I would suggest, if you are looking for a place for a loved one and if you are on here you are, call them, go on a tour and look at the health department reports. They are only human so, if there is a problem, talk to them and let them know what you would like for your family member and then just stand back and watch it happen.\n",
      "My sister's and I have an annual tradition of getting pedicures for the Christmas season. We came upon this little gem by happenstance!!! We walked in and asked for a standard pedicure for each of us (all with a design). They set us up right away! The whole staff was incredibly friendly. Each of the ladies were wonderful!!! So nice, very attentive and aware of how we were feeling during the whole pedicure (checking to see if we were comfortable, if the water or stones were too hot etc). They were very reasonably priced as well. Overall we had a fantastic experience and we will definitely be visiting again!!!\n",
      "This place had recently moved to a brand new location and I stumbled into the grand opening. The new salon is BEAUTIFUL, clean and everything a nail salon should be. The people were friendly and prices were good. I knew exactly what I was getting with my pedicure and it was one of the best pedicures I have ever had. I only got a basic, so I can't imagine what a deluxe 40.00 pedi would have been. (Mine was the 20.00 special) since I had time to kill I got a mani too. It wasn't as good as the pedi, but I was still in and out, and my nails look FANTASTIC! Next time I'm in Mesa I will be back!\n",
      "The 1st two times i went there i really liked it! I really liked my nails the 1st time, 2nd i went they were too thick. Now i just went on valentine day with ny boyfriend i had fills and he did a manicure the lady that did my boyfriend nails was more into him then doing a good job, the lady that did my nails you could tell she didn't want to do it. She was far away, making faces and had an attitude. The Monday follow valentine day my pinky nail popped off so i went in and had it fix now i had to go back in because my pointer and middle finger popped off. When i got there the lady stood up to go to the bank and the other guy was just on the phone. I don't even think she went to the bank because i heard her speaking in the back room, so i got up and left. I don't understand how if you were just sitting there when a customer come in then you have to go to the bank. Terrible\n",
      "Very clean and great welcoming decor. Nail tech was nice and aimed to please. I had a specific design that I wanted and he did it perfectly. I would highly recommend this place and will be returning in the future.\n",
      "This is a really nice place and the staff is very friendly, but I have experienced better. I made sure I called in the morning and made a late afternoon appointment for me, my sister and my niece for my nieces birthday. She wanted to get her toes done, so I thought it would be fun for all of us to get it done together. When we got there, right around our appointment time, they were slammed. Yes I understand they randomly get busy with different people and different parties, hence the reason I made an appointment. After waiting a half hour after our appointment time, they put me and my niece together and put my sister clear over on the other side. So we weren't all able to talk and visit while getting our toes done like I wanted to. Our pedicures were also rushed and I feel like done half..... you know what. They did this because they were busy and had to get everyone in. My niece and I ended up getting done 20 minutes before my sister so we had to wait another 20 minutes to leave. It just wasn't the great bonding experience we wanted for my nieces bday. There is no point in going in a group and making an appointment when nothing is accomodated. Also it shouldn't take 2 hours to get 3 pedicures done, especially with making an appointment! It threw off the rest of my nieces bday plans for the evening! Really disappointed.\n",
      "I decided to take my two daughters with me to get pedicures, two manicures and a full set for me. Everything was going great when we were getting our pedicures; when we sat down for our manicures one of the nail technicians started screaming at her husband. She became so mad at him that she was screaming at him the entire time I was getting my full set and my daughters were getting their manicures. Her husband was the one working on my daughter's manicure and he ended up speeding through it because he had to go outside because she would not stop screaming. The man who was working on my nails started yelling at her about the customers and he was telling me how sorry and embarrassed he was. I felt bad for him, but he started to rush just to get us out of there because she was becoming irate. She was walking around holding bottles of nail polishes when she dropped three of them right next to me. She started saying sorry, but my purse was on the floor along with glass and I'm not trying to sound like a brat, but my purse was just given to me by my husband that was a Michael Kors purse that cost $400. I was so upset and the man who did my nails did not even file them all the way because he rushed. They were so lumpy. I walked out of their spending $270! I will never return again.\n",
      "Had a fabulous experience today! Tracy did an amazing job removing my old acrylic nails and gave me beautiful dip powder nails in their place. Also had the standard pedicure which was outstanding, came with great massage and hot stones too! So clean and warm and friendly. I'll definitely be going back!\n",
      "Currently here now and the guy that is doing my feet is a bit rough like he hates his job or he's on his period. He tells me, your feet are dry on the bottom. No shit! A)That's why I'm here and why im paying a pedicure B) I didn't ask for your opinion. I will say the few times before today that I have came, I loved this place. He also treid to rush me out of my seat when they had 6 open seats and my polish could have been done better. It's disappointing that this guy ruined that for me. I'm reading the others comments and looks like what I'm saying isn't a shocker. Darn.... on to the next place. (P.S it wasn't tommy, he does a great job!)\n",
      "Place was beautiful clean with lots of color choices. But the person that did my mini pedi was clearly didn't have experience. cut my nails down to where the flesh meets the nail and then still tried to file and buff them OUCH! Then took forever to paint my teeny tiny toenails. They looked like a 5 yr old painted em. Then the owner came over to see what was talking forever and took over finishing me up.\n",
      "Pleasant experience, had the wax pedicure and fill on nails. Very clean, quiet and techs were friendly. Nice sugar scrub, hot rocks and hot towels!\n",
      "Very friendly staff. Clean and beautiful atmosphere. This was my first time and now I'm a regular! Lee did my pedicure. He was so kind & took his time massaging me. They even have a timer to keep track of how long they massage you! So you get full service of what pedicure you choose and I like that! Btw I don't get pedicure often but I had a stressful month so going to this nails salon shop was the best thing I did! Plus he help me really relax to a point I almost feel asleep. Will be back soon. Thank you blue sky nails!\n",
      "Always great service, salon is very clean, and friendly staff! I come here regularly for shellac manicures, pedicures, and eyelash extensions. The eyelash extension refills are only $35! You can't beat that! My nails and eyelashes are.always looking great because of this place.\n",
      "Consistently excellent service in a relaxing and beautiful atmosphere. Phenomenal customer service every time.\n",
      "First time here... Lady who did my pedicure didn't know how to so a french pedi... So another lady finished my toes. Then I waited 30 minutes to get a fill!??? They aren't super busy but unorganized as they took a walk in before me? I guess this is what I get for trying a new place!! I would not recommend this nail salon!!! The only reason I came in here is because my salon is closed for the holiday and I couldn't wait until Friday to get this done... I paid for my pedicure and left. They told me they would give me a 20% discount on my fill when I come back? I won't be going back.\n",
      "Glad I ignored the bad reviews. I've been to cleaner salons, but by no means was it dirty. Got the callus removal sugar scrub with hot stones and hot towel pedi and a very basic cheapest mani. Both were relaxing, professional and the end result is so pretty! Friendly staff, very quickly sat in the pedi chair on a Friday at 3:00. Just passing thru Mesa for the weekend, but if I ever find myself here again, I will come back. Ignore the haters and spend your money and time here.\n",
      "Friendly service and good pedicure. Unfortunately this will not be my new manicure place. My gel manicure lasted 6 days before it started to peel up on the edges..... I usually get at least 2 weeks wear.\n",
      "I love this place! They are doing my bridal party nails and got me cake and wine! They always remember my name and do the best job. I go nowhere else for my nails!\n",
      "Really wanted this place to be good...very cute and clean with a great polish selection and very nice staff, but my nails are not great. Had a pedicure with added callus removal and I still have calluses. Also got a gel mani and my nails are rough on the edges and there is gel on the sides of my fingers and cuticles. So bummed I paid $60 for these results.\n",
      "Nice people, good service and they were able to do a good job with my custom design for my nails.\n",
      "I love this place! I've been to many nail salons and the service and quality here can't be beat. I will definitely be heading back every month.\n",
      "I will never go anywhere else. I came in with a botched SNS job and they fixed it in no time. They were friendly, the salon was clean. If you want your nails done right, this is the place to go.\n",
      "Not only is this nail salon a relaxing, beautifully decorated, and very clean place to get your nails done, the staff does great work and the polish outlasted any other place I've been to in the valley. They are super friendly and even stayed open later for me so that I could get taken care of. They are reasonably priced too. It's kind of tucked away in a mini mall and not in plain sight which makes it not as packed as other salons, so the wait isn't bad either. Overall, it's a great experience!\n",
      "Blue Sky Nails & Spa are the best! Here for our niece Kellie's pre-wedding mani & pedicures. The salon staff are the friendliest & did such a great job. Love them & this salon! Thanks Blue Sky. Our bride is happy.\n",
      "Two weeks ago to the day, I Decided to try this place out since it was right by my house. Reviews were decent and I am pretty picky about my nails so I was hoping they were going to be great. When I went inside I noticed there was only one person there. Seemed rather slow. But I sat with Tracy. Tracy was nice. Soft spoken. There was another nail tech that sat next to her, waiting for her nails to dry. Assuming she worked there because she walked around like she owned the place. I had removed my acrylics days prior to coming in. When she heard me telling Tracy that I did that, with a judgy attitude she was shocked I removed them on my own. Sorry but I can use acetone and soak them off on my own. No need to pay you to do them for me. Plus just the look and tsk tsk tsk she gave me was not called for. Anyway. Back to Tracy. I asked for rounded nails and she gave me square wide nails. One was completely crooked. But I was just ready to leave the place. So here we are exactly two weeks to the day and two nails are completely lifting. One from the bottom and the other from the side. I had to go to another nail Shop to reshape them because I couldn't do the wide square shape. Typically when I get my nails done, they last 3 almost 4! Weeks without a problem.\n",
      "I found this on Yelp and went because the reviews are pretty good. I got a regular polish French manicure and it was nice, I would have liked it if they spent more time on a hand massage. The polish selection is good and I like that they used Seche Vite topcoat because it's my favorite. I asked for a specific style of French where the base was a dark polish and the tip was black, the nail tech didn't understand me and did something different for the first nail but when I told her again what I was looking for she wiped my nail and re-did it. She had a very pleasant attitude and excused herself for the misunderstanding. Overall a good experience and the place looks newly remodeled and very clean.\n",
      "I was in the area and I needed a pedicure. For $22 it was a great price and a great pedicure. If I'm ever over there again I'll be sure to stop in.\n",
      "Do not waste your money. Plain and simple. No attention to detail, did a gel manicure in 25 minutes. Turned out awful. Had a bad feeling when I walked in, should have listened to myself. Also they could really step up the cleanliness. I would be afraid of the germs in there!\n",
      "This place is great! The service is exceptional and the owners are the best! I had searched hard for a nail salon where my gel manicure would not come off after a week. They take their time and make sure I am always 100% satisfied. Everyone is so personal with you and they really go the extra mile. The prices are the best around!! I have referred a couple of friends and they have nothing but great things to say as well. Now they are returning customers! I am so happy I have found this spot!\n",
      "Very disappointed. The shop just opened and it was super hot inside! Went to get my eyebrows waxed. I had to wait because the technician was not even there yet. When she finally came, she never introduced herself to me, she just said sorry I'm late and brought me back to the room. She told me to get on the bed, it had a paper sheet on it, which had imprints of the previous persons feet, butt and head. She got started and her phone rang, she took the call and started putting wax on my eyebrows, then she ended up getting some on my hair! She tried to take it off, but it didn't work. She just told me to use baby oil on it. (Mind you I don't carry baby oil on me and I was going straight to work!) the whole experience was horrible. Not going back!\n",
      "Love coming to this place! Always friendly and the prices are great! I'm addicting to the new nail technique called dip powder nails. No drilling of my nails and the powder is strong like acrylics. Lots of pretty colors too!! This place is always clean. That is very important to me.\n",
      "Horrible Experience! My wife went into this salon for the first time to get a gel manicure. The tech was friendly but that same night it was peeling (usually lasts 2 weeks) While she was getting her nails done she asked the tech about her eye lashes as the lady she was seeing took a break from doing lashes. The tech said she got her lashes done there. ($80) Two days later she returned to have them \"fix\" the gel manicure, rather then removing it the correct way they ripped all 4 layers off and painted over them. Which caused them to peel that night again. The day she was in to get her nails fixed she got her lashes done. The lady was very unprofessional, not wearing gloves, and seeming rushed. The result was so bad. At the end of the day she had clumps of lashes falling out, her whole left eyelid was missing 1/3 of the lashes. She lost over 1/2 the lashes by the end of the night, and the glue was so clumpy that she could not see. ($80) My wife is a Nurse and she works in the NICU where she has to be able to see. She had to schedule a removal from a profesional eyelash company to have the lashes professionally removed. ($25) In total she spent $185. We called the next day and went to explain the issue. The manager was a joke, said that there was nothing he could do, and they do not offer any refunds. We asked for $50 back and said that was fair, to which he laughed, took 3 days to reply, and did not give any resolution. Please be warned that while they are nice, and the salon is clean, they should not be offering services such as lashes or gel manicures.\n",
      "Love this place!! Tracy and the crew are awesome and so friendly. Thank you for my wedding nails! I love them!\n",
      "I really like ' Blue sky nails & spa ' .good service , friendly , very clean .. I feel alway happy after my nails done , especially pedicure , long massage & relaxing .\n",
      "Been here two times now, and service has been amazing. Super friendly, and do EXACTLY what I ask and want for my nails! Went to Tony the first time, and I love how he did my nails, he was so patient and showed he cared and wanted me to leave happy. Second time I went with Tracy and she was just as amazing as well!!\n",
      "Came here with my mother and sister in-laws to get our Christmas mani + pedi done. We have tried most of the nail salons around this area. We are trying to find one that we can come back regularly to that we like by so far we skip around. This place has a cute and modern setup. They do a really good job taking their time doing the massages and hot stones on your legs. Most nail salons offer the same service but they rush through and sometimes don't even do the hot stone. I'm impressed so far. Now my gel nails didn't turn out so well, but could be the lady that did mine wasn't familiar with the colors I was asking for ( red with silver tips ) because it took her awhile to find the silver I wanted. She used a dark matte gray then a clear glittery gray, which didn't look right against the red she did. Finally she went and got another nail tech to help her. That tech found the silver I wanted and finished up right away. The red turned out to look more like Dorothy's shoes from wizard of oz, which wasn't what I was looking for but honestly I may give them another try because they did a great job with the pedi.\n",
      "Love this nails spa. Tracy gave me a wonderful pedicure on Sunday. Today Emily did a great job on my nails! So in love with this place\n",
      "Came in for my monthly nails and as always Kenny did a great job! Talked me into beautiful Valentine's nails although they are a little pink they certainly will set me in the mood for February! Didn't like the first design he did ( he did it great I just wanted it in a different color) so he happily changed it. He always does an excellent job as does everyone else in the shop. I've been coming here now for probably 6 months and they always do an excellent job. I highly recommend them.\n",
      "I came in for a quick fill and Tracy (I think her name was) said the place that did them before did a bad thing by putting powder acrylic on my real nails. Very hard to get off so it ruins the nail and u can't back fill. So she ended up putting on a new set. Skeptical at first bc I really liked my nails from the other salon. She stayed late after closing to fix my nails and they are gorgeous!!. She was sincere on trying to make sure I got my $ worth and did not rush just bc they closed. I will for sure be back to see her\n",
      "HORRIBLE service. Soaked my feet in tub for 45 minutes unattended. Take on more customers than they can accommodate. Rude. Just had to leave.\n",
      "Went for the first time today (Tuesday) as a walk-in right when they opened for a gel manicure. It was not crowded and they got me in immediately. Staff was very friendly and welcoming, unlike other nail salons that I have been to. I brought in a photo and Helen did a great job at free-handing the design. She was quite a perfectionist (which I appreciate!) and took her time with both the application as well as the great hand/lotion massage once my nails were complete. The gel manicure cost $25 and design $5. Be sure to tip in cash, if you are able. I will definitely be back.\n",
      "As always I'm satisfied with Blue Sky Nail Salon I've been a loyal customer for years and Tracy the GM always takes care of me. This place is the cleanest nail salon by far in the east valley they have really good staff and their wax services are amazing as well. If you are looking to get a design I recommend Tracey or V they're both great! For wax I recommend Tracey it's amazing every time and never hurts!\n",
      "Always great service here and they do a great job with all my designs I ask for! Highly recommended.\n",
      "Two friends and I visited Blue Sky today for the first time. We all had mani/pedis and it was sheer heaven for all three of us!! The pedicures they offer were the best any of us have ever had!! I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip! I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!\n",
      "My usual nail place is under new management and I had been having inconsistent experiences, so I was looking to try somewhere new. Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go. I got the standard pedi and I really enjoyed it. It includes a hot stone massage and a hot towel, which was awesome. The shop has a nice, quiet atmosphere and is very pretty inside. I'll be back and will be looking to try some of the other options they have. :)\n",
      "My new favorite! The place has a great atmosphere, very clean and the staff is very friendly. The person assisting me was friendly but not giving me the 3rd degree like at other salons. Just a nice, relaxing experience.\n",
      "I love coming to this nail salon. I used to go to another one nearby but the service is not as good as this place. They are very friendly and do a great job on my nails! They take the time and do it right and at great prices too! Plus they are open till 7 pm which is good for those who work all day. I highly recommended Blue Sky!\n",
      "Love this place!!! Been coming here for over a year and I have nothing but good things to say! The service is great and they do a fantastic job. Great pricing and everyone is very nice. I took my two younger sisters with me and we were all very satisfied with what we got. If your looking for a good deal and good work! Come here!!!!!!\n",
      "This place is ok. The person who was designing my nails completely botched them, stating that he hadn't done them in a long time. Don't provide the service if you don't know what you're doing. Other than that, the service was very friendly and helpful. I will get waxed here but probably never come back, seeing as I am picky with my nails. They came out bumpy and the designs look like they were done by a 2 year old.\n",
      "Loved this place. Very clean and lots of nail polish color choices! Tracy did a great job on my gel mani!\n",
      "I have been here twice and both times Henry has done my nails. He has done a wonderful job both times. I'm very picky when it comes to my nails and how I like them and he doesn't need direction...not with 12+ experience in the business. I will be back :)\n",
      "I got a pedicure here on a weekday. From start to finish, it was 45 minutes. Salon is beautiful and the technician who gave me the pedicure was great. If you're in the area, check this place out for nails.\n",
      "I drive from west Mesa for the awesome massage with the pedicure. I've gone all over Mesa, Ahwatukee, Scottsdale. They take their time and don't ignore the toes with the massage! I'm an RN, I'm on my feet most of my shift 3 to 4 days a week. They are ready when I have an appointment, I don't have to wait because a walkin arrived right before me - respecting my time!\n",
      "I adore this place! Everyone is wonderful here and always do the best job. I even bring my kids here because they are so wonderful at what they do. From pedicures to manicures and even eyelash extensions they know what they are doing. My daughter turned 7 and I brought her sister and her here for their first manicures. They couldn't have been happier and they adored it. Thank you guys for being so awesome!\n",
      "We are new in the Mesa area, I googled nail salons and Blue Sky came up. I'm always a little sceptic about trying new nail salons. We hit the jack pot on this one. Absolutely the best pedi ever!!!! It's a must try if you're in the Mesa area.\n",
      "I come here almost every month and have been coming for almost three years! Tracy always does an awesome job with my pedicures and designs my toes with my favorite Pinterest designs!\n",
      "Went for first time today with my two daughters. The pedicures were fabulous except the gentleman who worked on my daughter got slightly rough with his filing block - made her bleed a little and then everything after that stung. The other pedis were great and the scrubs smell soooo good! Great color selection of polish/gels and it's a very clean shop with very calming decor and soft music. Our manis were very well done. Tracy did a custom job on my nails and it turned out quite nice. Prices are comparable to other shops we've been to. Will definitely return for future visits!\n",
      "Amazing experience. My sister brought me here & treated me to a deluxe pedicure. It was the best!!!! I plan on coming back for sure. :) friendly staff & great service\n",
      "What a fabulous place! Super clean inside and the staff is really friendly. 97$ for 2 shellac color manicures, one fill and one eyebrow wax. Great for bridal parties or birthdays as the setup has chairs facing each other :) Great customer service. Would recommend and will be back!\n",
      "I really love this place. I was trying somewhere that was closer to my work but found this place near my house and will look no further. No one that works here is real chatty but I LOVE that. I just want to sit & relax and they respect it. Not to mention, my gel fill lasted 3 weeks and looked great the whole time. I will continue to go to this place. Thank you!\n",
      "I went here on the basis of the reviews on yelp, after all, it's never steered me wrong before! My friend and I went here to get pedicures and how I wish we wouldn't have. While the place seemed clean, it was dead for a weekend (that should have been my first hint). Two guys did our pedicures. My friend got a basic color and I asked for a design from one of their pictures that were in the book on the table. Well my friends toes were cut in a \"u\" shape, dipping down in the middle and high on the sides-she was so confused, had the guy ever given a pedicure before? My design looked anything like the picture and ended up looking more like jail stripes than the cute summer chevron I had asked for. When it was time to pay my bill was more than what the sign said, but I never received a breakdown, looking back I probably should have asked, but we were meeting my mom after and needed to go. Flash forward, my second toe on each foot has been bothering me since the pedicure... saw a medical professional and they told me the place gave me a staff infection as well as an ingrown toenail. Y'all a STAFF INFECTION! I have been getting pedicures my whole life and never experienced anything like this. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a new place to get my nails did... Don't go to this place! Please find somewhere else, the pain and aggravation isn't worth it- you don't want this!\n",
      "I have been coming here for 3 years and I always leave happy. I am VERY picky about how I want my nails to look and they do a great job here. If there is something I don't like they have no problem fixing it. The staff is very friendly, the salon is clean, and they have tons of gel and SNS colors to choose from. I highly recommend Blue Sky!\n",
      "I love this place. I've been coming here for two years and they treat me like family. They always do an excellent job with my manis, pedis, and lashes!!\n",
      "My mom and I got the Deluxe pedicures and they were AMAZING! I am coking back next week for nails and lashes :)\n",
      "I've been here a few times after work and they have never disappointed. Fair prices ($45 for the best pedi) & very friendly staff. You will leave feeling pampered for sure!!\n",
      "I've been getting acrylic fills and pedicures for over 30 years in Los Angeles. Before I left on my AZ trip, I checked out yelp in Mesa and booked an appt for my Mom and I. I've previously gone to other local Mesa nail salons when in town and not very satisfied. It was a total pleasure to come to Blue Sky Nails! The staff is amazing! Andy did the best pedicure I've ever had in 30 years. My Moms full set and pedicure was perfect. I am so pleased with this place and the prices are great! This is my new nail salon when I visit Mesa! Thanks Andy and staff!!!\n",
      "Went here for the first time today and had a nice, relaxing pedicure. There was a decent amount of people for a Saturday afternoon, both clients and employees. Not too busy though. I got seated pretty quickly and asked for the standard pedi. The guy doing my nails was nice and I thought he did a good job. Two of my biggest pet peeves when getting my nails done is feeling rushed and when people keep talking to me :) He did neither and gave me a long massage, so I was a happy camper. I took one star off because I didn't think it was the cleanest place (particularly the bathroom), but I'll go back another time to try it out again.\n",
      "This is the only nail place I go to and they are great! I moved up to North Mesa and I still drive down here. The price is fairly inexpensive compared to other places, they take their time, are friendly, and it is clean (they use plastic bags when getting a pedicure). Definitely recommend it!\n",
      "Clean, friendly and beautiful job on my toes!! I was accommodated even though I walked in right before closing! I was greeted with a bottle of cold water! Nice touch, especially in the hot summer! Their standard pedi also comes with a hot stone massage! Yay!\n",
      "Second time I give this place \"the benefit of doubt\" and once again, I leave so disappointed. Their staff is not very friendly and the guy that did my acrylic nails left them way too short and pointy. As if all that was not enough I was charged $46 dollars for a job that anywhere else you would pay at least $10 less. I don't mind paying extra for quality and friendliness, however this place has neither.\n",
      "This store is absolutely filthy. I went in to grab a quick dinner for my kids on their way to practice. I read the exact order from my phone and had them make it. As I was waiting I stood over by the drink area to get out of the way from the cashier to get out of the way of people trying to pay. While I was there I noticed that the floor was sticky but looked up and saw a bottle of honey and figured someone must have spilled some. I dropped off my kids dinner and then ran home to get some work I needed to catch up on and got a text that my daughters order was wrong. Tough luck I told her, but just pick off what you don't like i'm sorry. Not 2 minutes later my other daughter text that her food is also wrong, which kind of pisses me off because I literally read their order from my phone, and now they are both wrong?? I am literally sticking to my kitchen floor at this point so I take off my shoe to try and clean the honey off before I have to get out the door again and it wasn't honey, it was ***iING GUM!!!! Disgusting!!! So not only did I waste 22 dollars for food that will not be eaten, but now I have someones filthy gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe and I am pissed! I called the manager because I was more pissed at this point about the gum than the sandwiches. He of course was apologetic and offered to credit my card and to give us a free meal, which I refused because there is no way we will eat there again. I just checked my credit card, and not only did he NOT credit my card, he re-charged me the $22.96! So now I am just going to call my credit card company and refuse Both charges with them. Employees are clearly not that bright, and the store is really dirty. Don't eat here.\n",
      "Let me start by saying this is not a bad review about the staff. The staff was very friendly and helpful and joyful. Here's the problem with this location. They have it set up \"Cafeteria Style\" which is VERY confusing and uncomfortable. At normal St. Louis Bread Company's (I'm from St. Louis which is where Panera started, so I know my Bread Co. lol) you go to the register, order your food and then they call your name. At this location, you go to one side of the counter, a person takes your order on a piece of paper, then you grab your number and your tray and make your way down the cafeteria line and the staff start putting food on your tray if it's ready. Then you make your way to the end and pay for your food. All-in-all, the service is friendly and fine, but the process needs major improvement. It needs to be simple and easy to order and receive the food.\n",
      "We enjoy the healthy food, with tasty options. We also appreciate the WiFi access with electricity. The facility was clean and the staff was very pleasant to work with.\n",
      "This time of year I am all about the Sweet treats, Panera is the place! Mint Cookies make for a great holiday party treat to give or to receive! If you are anything like me......and earned the title \"cookie monster\" as a kid......because I ate all the icing out of the Orieo cookies and put the cookie part back in the package...thinking no one would notice......then get the Petite Cookies instead. Not that you won't make up the difference by eating 20 of them, you will just think your eating less.\n",
      "This is by far the Best Panera Bread I have ever been too. Brand new, clean and the food us terrific! Eric and staff run the place like a finely tuned machine. Food came out hot and tasty as can be. Perfect!\n",
      "Our server was nice but sadly the food was just ok. We ordered the following dishes: Bone marrow: the bone marrow was good but the crostini that came with it was stale, old and chewy it was so hard to chew. We asked if it's suppose to be crunchy because most crostini are and the server says I honestly don't know ................ Well she went to go and ask the cook if they can make the crostini crunchy.... They did but she only came out with two pieces.... Reallllllyyyyy there's two of us and we have two big Bones with bone marrow... Well she At least she tried. Butter chicken and halfsies: hmmm it's a wanna be chicken curry with undercooked soupy rice........ Pork belly Mac: the pork belly was good sadly the skin was soggy from the cheese sauce.. The pasta was over cooked. The idea of the dish was pretty cool though. Steak frites: if you want steak in your butter order this you'd love it!\n",
      "Stopped here for lunch - it's a nice gastopub with an interesting menu. I had the soup of the day, which was great, and also ordered the beet salad. I would not order the beet salad again - while I love beets, I just didn't feel like the flavors went together. My friend ordered a salad as well, but they came out and explained they were out of avocado, which was kind of key to that salad. She ended up getting it anyway with chicken and thought it was good. I wouldn't say it's out-of-this-world, but would definitely eat here again.\n",
      "I go to Cooper's Tavern about once a week with a friend, and we always order the same thing. I am in love with their corn caesar salad, harvest soup, and frites. As for the service, it is not great. The past few times I've gone the server lacks enthusiasm or forgets to bring us our drinks. Overall, I would recommend Cooper's though for their food!\n",
      "This place is truly a gem next to the Capitol. I have been there three times with my wife and every time we're met with delicious food, and accommodating staff. They deserve 5-stars just for their amazing customer service. However, they should get another 5 for the food as well. The Cooper's Tavern doesn't suffer the same issues of unremarkable and bland, soggy food (I.E. The Old Fashioned). If you ever find yourself in Madison, give this place a shot. You shan't be disappointed. Edit: Thank you, Brie! You were the warmest and sweetest server ever. I appreciate you and the rest of the staff's hard work. I will be coming back again and again.\n",
      "Met a few friends for dinner last night- we were seated right away, but it was very early. As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind. The menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish. The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine. Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often.\n",
      "Went for lunch on Sunday. I'd almost give it 3.5 but it is not quite there yet to give it 4. The food is good but not so good I'd recommend it to others when there are better places around the square (Graze, Merchant, etc). The cider on draft was very good and they have a nice selection of beers. The bartender was not overly interested or friendly so that was a partial disappointment. Our table was right by the door so every time someone walked in I was blasted with cold air. Not sure if anything can be done about it, but it made my dining experience less pleasant. We got the beer cheese pretzels. They were very good but the portions were kind of small. I saved the leftover cheese to dip my fries in. Two of us shared the burger and they did a nice job splitting it. The homemade chips were quite tasty as well. Overall, it is a good place and a decent choice. I went once a year ago and had their fish and chips (Old Fashiioned had an 1.5 hr wait so we went to Coopers instead). I don't feel you'll get a bad meal there. I just have not have such a stellar experience that I would make it top of my list.\n",
      "I have contemplated whether to write this. It has gnawed at me. Ten days ago we ate at the tavern. Sitting outside. Beautiful setting. Very nice. As tables turned over, the tables were cleaned. At one table, the cloth used to wipe the tables was dropped on the ground. Seminal moment. Rather than immediately replace the cloth, the cloth was picked up and put back on the table and the wiping continued. I immediately remove my hands from the table and didn't want to touch anything. What hope does one have that kitchen staff are trained any better? Foundation of any food establishment is proper cleanness training. So sad as the the food tasted good. Yikes!\n",
      "Good food great beer selection excellent staff that hustles to keep up- place gets extremely busy! Upstairs for events is a nice spot. The owner is a good dude that supports the community so that's a plus.\n",
      "One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!!!! I really enjoyed this place the first few times I went, but they clearly take no pride in who they hire. We had the most incompetent stupid girl ever serve us. She'd really be better off having Daddy pay for her sorority dues than trying to work as a server. This waitress scoffed at us when we ordered 4 waters even though we ended up ordering bloody marys which were terrible at best. She then proceeded to ignore us for awhile as we sat there patiently. Then finally approaching us asking if we were ready to order even though she didn't tell us the specials (the staple meals for having brunch there). Once we ordered we waited a absurdly long time followed by our Sigma waitress only bringing out 3 of the 4 dishes saying \"oh my gooood were down one\". It took 15 minutes if not more for that fourth plate to come while all our meals were getting nice and cold. I could go on about how my corn beef hash was more like a bag of beef jerky but I digress.... If you care about service at all I would highly recommend you do not go here! And just think if you do... Then you are supporting these types of horrible servers. I hope this helps... At the very least I hope it gives Coopers a bad mark against them.\n",
      "My buddies and I stopped be the night before the OSU football game. Everything was crowded but this place had an outside patio. I believe I overheard our waiter say it was his second day so he was visibly overwhelmed but he did try his hardest. We did wait a long time for food and drinks but the food was amazing. Two of my buddies had the Rueben in which they both said it was really good and I had the sliders that were perfectly cooked and juicy. The food was very good and I would stop by if I am ever in Madison again.\n",
      "i've been here a few times now. the beer list is pretty solid, but the bloody marys are just ok. the turkey sandwich is awesome (with gouda and apple-pear slaw, yum!), and they definitely get points for having poutine on the menu. i would come more often if it wasn't always packed to the gills.\n",
      "This is a great place for groups, everyone else not so much. If you have a noisy, boisterous group of people that want very good food & a wide selection of excellent micro/import beers on tap, this is your place. The wait service is a little indifferent, but if your busy talking with your party, you won't notice. I would be interested to see if it would be different in the summer when they have outdoor seating.\n",
      "The atmosphere was cramped and the service seemed kinda rushed but the food and the drink selection were decent. While I enjoyed the pork belly mac and cheese, I think the pork belly would probably be way too rich for most people. I think it's more of a bar than it is a restaurant and that might be OK for some but it was difficult for me to hold a conversation and have a relaxed dining experience here. I would maybe come back here for drinks or a quick bite, but maybe not for dinner again.\n",
      "Myself and 2 friends were in town visiting for the first time. We checked out the State street area upon the advice of friends. We came across Cooper's Tavern while looking for a place to eat and have a fee drinks. Sitting outside was a treat for mid-October and in the shadows of the state capitol was a bonus. The service left something to be desired it was our server's 2nd day on the job and the place was packed. The food was excellent, the Reuben sandwich was delicious and they had an extensive list of both tap and bottled beers.\n",
      "4 of us stopped here before a play for dinner. The menu looked interesting and a bit creative online. We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly. Maybe she was new, but she was unable to answer some of our questions about the beverage and food menu. Our dinner was served in a timely manner. We all agreed, it was very average at best. We decided to share some type of cheesecake dessert. It was definitely prepackaged and tasted like a refrigerator, yuk! A cute place, but the food quality was just not there.\n",
      "Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. However the service was a little disappointing. On each visit there was a hiccup with either the food being brought out on a timely manner (e.g. appetizers should come out before the meal) or some confusion on the items actually ordered. Nonetheless I would recommend this place. Last warning, the space could prove a slight clusterphobic during peak hours. Great beer selection.\n",
      "Cooper's is a great place for a quick and tasty lunch if you're up in the Capitol area. It's kinda hidden---I've walked by it a million times but never stopped there. I've had three meals there---a chicken sandwich (delicious) and Amy's salad (twice). The first time the salad was amazing. The second time, the apple they shred over the salad was brown and soggy. It was a little gross, to say the least. I pushed it to the side and continued on my way. I've also had the pretzel appetizer, which is very good. My friend raves about the grilled cheese. Expect to spend about $10-$15. I haven't gotten around to trying any of the beers, but they have an impressive selection. Check this place out, especially if you work downtown. They are very conscientious about getting you in and out of there in an hour if you have lunch time constraints.\n",
      "We stopped in here for a quick bite to eat. We sat at the bar since the restaurant was packed. We decided on a bunch of appetizers and a salad to split between the two of us. We had the poutine, large pretzel, butternut squash soup and and a chicken Caesar salad. Everything was yummy and will definitely go again next time we are in town!\n",
      "One of my favorite restaurants downtown near the square. The place is usually really busy downstairs, but there's almost alwasy room in the new upstairs, but beware that the menu up there is limited! Great beer selection and they make a good old fashion. The food is constantly good and fresh! It can be a little spendy for casual dining, but the dishes are fresh, local and you are right downtown with views of the capitol.\n",
      "This is a review of the vegetarian offerings a Cooper's. I stopped in for a late morning brunch today and was surprised to find Cooper's was relatively empty. There was a soccer game on TV and a dozen fans sprinkled around the bar, but there were open tables galore. SCORE! Vegetarian options here are pretty plentiful. Several vegan dishes are possible with a helpful waiter and some small tweaks. For veg heads: Breakfast-y: -breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheddar, spinach on english muffin) -vegetarian scrambler (changes daily, today it was eggs and a combination of veggies and feta) -oatmeal brulee (oats and apples with custard under a sweet crust) -banana french toast (banana bread in a brown sugar custard served with maple syrup and fruit) -granola Lunch-y: -hummus appetizer (beetroot hummus topped with olives, feta, chive oil, and crispy chickpeas served with lavash crackers) -sweet potato chili (roasted sweet potatoes and black beans with chipotle, topped with dubliner cheddar, sour cream, and scallions. Comes with cornbread) -several salads -veggie sandwich (roasted zucchini, red peppers, carrots and portobello mushrooms on wheatberry bread with hummus, feta, and oven-dried tomatoes) -grilled cheese Today I got the sweet potato chili sans dairy toppings to make it vegan and it was really delicious. Spicy and super flavorful! I'll be back just to have a heaping bowl of the stuff. In the past I've gotten the veggie sandwich (very solid), and the hummus appetizer (great for sharing and lots of tasty items to nosh in the arrangement). Overall I give Cooper's 4 out of 5 for veggie options at an omnivorous hangout. There are some solid ones, including a couple creative items like the oatmeal brulee. It would be fantastic to see a meat-free burger of some sort, but in the mean time Cooper's is doing a pretty good job.\n",
      "Two of our very good friends, my husband, and I wanted a night out at a new Madison eatery. It was a Sat. night without reservations. Thankfully we found a spot at the bar and enjoyed a few beverages before dinner. The bartender offered samples and suggestions to the various beers we were interested in. My husband has Celiac, several options were present. Yes, the variety and knowledge of beverages was exceptional but the food was lacking. My husband ordered the pork chop, it came out (too) rare and was sent back. They comped us for this thankfully. My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken curry dish. The chicken was tender but extremely salty! It was if they had brined the chicken over night. The curry sauce was very comfort food yummy. I know it's a European/Canadian thing to have gravy covered fries but I'm not a fan. Our friend ordered the mussels and loved them! We shared desserts of Creme Brulee - Delish!!! and chocolate cheese cake (i think) - dry and blah Not a fan of the menu, or options (too few). Like i read in previous reviews, i 'd go for drinks but not the food.\n",
      "cool place, food was ok... not great not terrible. Mussells were bland, despite the waitress doing a great job explaining how they are prepared... that cool egg , wrapped in meat and deep fried was fun, different and the mustard sauce was special.. we are a larger group so tried a lot... pretzel sticks were tasty.. service fair.. almost got 3 stars but not quite, and i would not rush back....\n",
      "I'm glad I came back here. Had a friend from Wales and my father in law with me and felt like getting some grub downtown. Old Fashioned had 45 minute wait on a Tuesday evening. NO THANKS. So I told them about Coopers, we were welcomed into the nicely air conditioned environment of Coopers with the cool ceiling fans. We were seated instantly. We started off with 2 Guinness Beer's and 1 Stella for myself. We had the \"Beer Cheese Pretzels.\" They only give you three pretzel sticks so be aware of that. The cheese was delish! We moved on to the entrees, I had the Pretzel Crusted Chicken, I'll spare you the details. IT WAS FANTASTIC! My Walsh friend had the Icelandic Haddock and stated that it was \"Superb\" or some fancy English word that they speak... My father in law had the pork chop and wasn't all that impressed. He really wanted mussels, however they sold out. Overall we enjoyed our entrees minus the pork chop. I will be back. Coopers has improved, service was great!\n",
      "Honestly the beer list and service saved this from being a single star. I was so excited to try out Cooper's! Even with the fantastic location, look of the place, and what's on the menu (in theory), it was very disappointing. To be clear, server was pleasant and prompt, especially given the size of the group we had. The noise level got so high that we were practically screaming to hear eachother, much less the server, the poor thing. Anyhow my true sorrow lay with the food. Sadly they were out of the bone marrow, the dish that I had really been looking forward to trying. (Always comparing bone marrows!) So, instead I split a variety of dishes with a friend. We got the Brie en Croute, Mussels du Jour, and Pork Belly Mac. The Brie en Croute itself was very tasty. The fruit and nuts they served it with seemed to serve more in a visual capacity rather than enhancing the taste of the dish but were amusing enough to nibble on. The bread was frustrating. It was ridiculously tough and nearly stale tasting. Nothing more fun than trying to salivate enough to be able to chew your food into submission! I ended up giving up on it all together. The Mussels du Jour were ok? I think? The dish seemed confused about itself. The mussels themselves and the broth were delicious. However the dish was topped with fries. Odd but not entirely out of place taste-wise. Then we got under the first layer and there were slices of plain boild potato under it! Not only was that aspect bland and unappealing, it just seemed straight up cheap. A way to make the dish seem bigger than it truly was. I was also very disappointed that we didn't get bread to soak up all the broth, one of the best parts about mussels prepared this way! (May have dodged a bullet there considering the bread from the brie) The Pork Belly Mac had a good base. The mac itself was perfect. Well textured pasta with a slightly sharp and thick cheese sauce (I did have to carefully extract a piece that wasn't coated in the other ingredients to find that out. Why the hell would you make a good cheese sauce only to shove it under loud clashing flavors?!). The pork belly was fantastically crisp on the outside and full of deliciously melty fat on the inside, a perfect substitute for my lack of marrow. The little onion crisps were a perfect match and I could have just eaten a bowl of those like fries! Unfortunately they felt the need to add sriracha and pickled pears. I'm a bit of a sriracha sloot but that flavor of heat was incredibly out of place in this dish. It overwhelmed all the positives and let you really soak in the failings of the dish. The pickled pears solo were fun, but they were added to the dish in massive chunks. I think the flavor combination may have made more sense if the pears had been in smaller pieces. Overall it just seemed like Cooper's was trying far too hard to come up with some unusual striking combinations without paying any attention to the end product. There were so many interesting looking dishes but the execution is so sloppy. Very annoyed that I paid so much for small portions of disappointment. The good news is the beer list is fairly extensive so kill your taste-buds with a few brews!\n",
      "The place filled up fast. It has a unique interior look. We ordered soup and sliders and asked for it all to come together. We got the sliders but then soup was about 10 mins behind. The sliders were awesome. I can't say the same about the soup though. The service was ok. I thought the prices were on the high side. It wasn't Ooo ah and it wasn't yuck, so I rated them right in the middle.\n",
      "This is the best place on the Capitol Square! Staff is very helpful and friendly, while the food is fresh, local and reasonably priced. I frequent Cooper's a lot for the friendly service and the great beer list!\n",
      "Went to Cooper's around 6:45 on a Friday. No available seating outside but open tables inside so we opted for those. Ordered a round of cocktails -- I got the brandy old fashioned and made it sour, and my friends got the jalapeño mule. We all loved our drinks! I tried the jalapeño mule and it had a little kick to it but was very good. For food, we ordered salads. My friends got the sweet corn caesar and I got Amy's salad. We added chicken to them to make the meal more substantial. They forgot the goat cheese on the Amy's salad, which would have made it even more delicious than it already was! Only complaint about the Amy's salad was that it was really heavy on the dressing. Like the spinach leaves were all thoroughly coated. Next time I'll ask for dressing on the side. My friends loved the Caesar salads -- I'll have to try that one sometime as well! Overall a nice first experience at Cooper's Tavern -- we will be returning!\n",
      "Excellent drink selection and bar food that really takes it up a notch from what you'd normally expect. The beer-cheese pretzels, in addition to being beautifully presented, were a perfect compliment to my obscure hefeweizen from Germany. Their imports also went well with my $3 mini-cheeseburgers; while each one was about as big as a half-dollar, they were clearly made from very high-quality beef and cheddar, and came with an exorbitant amount of deep-fried potato chips made from scratch. The beet salad was honestly one of the best salads I've ever had. I do have one warning: don't even think about the bone marrow crostini if you aren't already a fan of bone marrow. Gamiest, smelliest piece of meat I've ever even looked at. I really should have known better than to order something as adventurous as that at what's basically a high-end pub. It reeked like urine and there was nothing on the plate to offset the squishy and smooth texture of the bone marrow other than their \"crostini\" (toasted french bread). It at least could have used some spices.\n",
      "Being a bit of a food snob this place sets the bar high and takes it higher. Service, food and beers is off the charts. Locally and independently owned (owner bought us a drink). They use 70 plus vendors with most being local. It is a must stop when in Madison. I highly recommend the Reuben and sweet potato chili. I will be back for sure. Cheers to a great meal and better time!\n",
      "I'll preface this review by stating that I was here with a large group and I understand how those can be a challenge for a restaurant. Still, it never ceases to amaze me how restaurants can understaff when they know well in advance that they have a large party coming. There must've been at least 50 patrons in the upstairs room and the restaurant only had two servers for the entire group. To put it in perspective, we arrived at 7 PM and started ordering from the limited menu chosen by the restaraunt. It was 9:15 PM before we finally received our entrées. Everyone in our party was so ready to leave, that we simply skipped dessert. The waitstaff, who were obviously overwhelmed, were simply just blah. Maybe they figured they had their mandatory tip for large parties sewed up and no extra effort was necessary. As far as the food goes, well it was average at best. There was not one item on the preselected menu that I found appetizing. I pleaded with my waitress to let me just get a hamburger and she refused. Honestly, I should've gotten up and walked downstairs and ordered a hamburger Avoid this place unless mediocrity is what you seek.\n",
      "Great energy and really cool menu. The salads were among the best we've had. The choice of beers is almost overwhelming and there are also some good wines by the glass. This restaurant was absolutely packed on a very cold Tuesday night when I worried it may be quiet - it was a very busy / good buzz / high energy - really liked it.\n",
      "Really liked the atmosphere and staff at this centrally located place, and if you come here for one reason only, make it a pretzel. The food and beer options are great, with some unique takes on classic dishes to take a little bit of the ho-hum out of pub food. Some of those unique takes are more or less successful. The french onion soup being one of the more successful items, the poblano caesar less so. The pretzel was incredibly delicious, with a really nice beer cheese sauce on the side. Bartenders were super helpful in making beer choices, and overall it's a nice place to spend an evening.\n",
      "Coopers used to be my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Madison. I'm not sure what happened, but for the past few months the great dining experience that once was the experience of Coopers has been replaced with a mediocre experience. Food quality has dropped and across-the-board friendly, prompt and competent service is now hit or miss.\n",
      "I enjoyed my experience at the Cooper's Tavern, for the most part. It was completely full -- I took the only remaining seat at the bar. It didn't really stand out as a place I'm dying to go back to, but the food was pretty good and the service was pretty decent. I had the Cooper Burger, which had great flavor. The cocktails were ok... I tried to order one a little less sweet, and the bartender just didn't seem to understand why I would want that, and didn't make it as ordered. So I ended up having to just switch to beer to play it safe. I'd certainly consider returning sometime for the burger, and hopefully it will be a little less busy and a little more personal.\n",
      "Man oh man did i want to give coopers tavern 5 stars!! But, I've been there three times and each time my experiences has gotten a little worse. The service got worse and unfortunately the food just wasn't as great the first time, but I still recommend this place for a go to spot in Madison. So here's my two cents on the food as long as you're prepared for a wait at the door and hit or miss service...and i guess food in some instances. First--get the beer cheese pretzel. you will not regret it. Their beer cheese dip has to be my absolute favorite ever. Now, i say that because the first two times i got it, it was heaven. Hot, ridiculously flavorful and gooey cheese with the perfectly salted pretzel, i have been to heaven twice with this app. however, the third time ordering it the cheese was a little colder and given to me in a plastic side dish rather than their insulated (or more insulated) glass. But anyways, just make sure you order the beer cheese rather than the mustard and you'll be good. I have also gotten the pork belly piggy mac twice and not regretted it a bit. I will say it is not the best pork belly by any means, but it is a hefty portion and the cheese mixture that they use is so good, my friends that came with me were raving about it the next day. one of them even had leftovers and couldn't wait to eat it the next day, which fun fact! If you can't finish the piggy mac, eat it the next day as leftovers and it's going to be just as good. Lastly, the grilled cheese, corn Caesar salad, and frites are all good. not super exceptional...maybe the grilled cheese because they have goat cheese and i'm a sucker for that, but everything else is good. As aforementioned the service is hit or miss, so hope that you get a good server and that the food comes out hot and you'll be a happy camper. til then, happy eating!\n",
      "I went for a quick after-work drink and a small bite to eat. I was amused when the waiter placed the menus in front of me: a 1-page food menu and a book-menu with the alcohol selections. The order of fries I got ($3.50) was huge, so was a great value, and they tasted great! I also got a Fat Tire which, at $5, was a little pricier than I'm used to, but I also need to blame myself a little because for that same price, I could've gotten a far more unique drink. I'd say it's a pretty sure thing I'll be back there before I leave this town.\n",
      "I've been to the Cooper's Tavern 3-4 times, and my best experiences have been at brunch or lunch on weekends. First of all, yes, the poutine is amazing. How could it not be? On my most recent brunch trip, my friend was feeling torn between getting eggs benedict or poutine, until I pointed out that not ONLY is there something magical called a Poutine Benedict (think poutine with poached eggs and hollandaise), it's only $6! What a steal. And it's as great as you want it to be. My friend wisely asked for a side of gravy with hers, which I did not think to. We shared it the gravy with our respective poutine benedicts -- highly recommend the side of gravy, as there wasn't enough hollandaise to dip fries in. Also the gravy is just delicious. The tap list is always impressive, but the bloody mary I got failed to meet my expectations. It might have been strong, but it was watery and nearly flavorless. I don't know how that is even possible in a bloody mary?! Also, our service was pretty terrible. Among other things, I asked for hot sauce and didn't get it until 3/4 through the meal, after asking yet again. Our water glasses were also empty a lot. My dinner experiences are what drag my rating down from 4 to 3 stars. Most recently I ordered the pretzel crusted chicken, which came with butternut squash hash and a mustard cream sauce. The hash was delicious, but the chicken was super dry and hard. What made that worse, was that there was nowhere near enough mustard sauce to salvage the chicken, make it softer or more flavorful. In general, I just wish their menu was a little more extensive. My advice: go to Coopers for drinks and poutine, or for brunch -- but don't order the bloody mary. Come to think of it, my friend ordered and Irish coffee and wasn't too impressed with that either. I'd stick to beer.\n",
      "Pros: Cool atmosphere. Great beer/drink selection. Fun location. Cons: We waited forever for a table. There's no good waiting space. We ordered a cheese plate and it was sooooo sad. The presentation was terrible. Our friend ended up with a terrible case of food poisoning from their Flank Steak \"special\". I like this place for the drinks and their patio is lovely when the weather is good. But...I don't think I'll ever return for the food.\n",
      "I've been here many times. Awesome beer list to choose from. Everyone walks away happy from the bar. More importantly, the only place that I know of that serves Putine! That delicious medley from north of the border. French fries with melted cheese curds smothered in brown gravy. A salty, gooey delicious mess of delight. Thanks Cooper's for bringing that to Madison. I got a little tired of the drive everytime I needed a Putine fix! The only negative about this place, it is always very loud in there. Hard to have a conversation without yelling. The acoustics are really bad.\n",
      "We have been here a few times and have never been disappointed. We almost always order the poutine as it is delicious. Recently I had the polenta dish and while I did enjoy it the broccoli rabe was cumbersome to eat. Otherwise everything about the dish was very good. My co-diners had the turkey sandwich and the flank steak special. Both meals were very good according to them. The fried haddock is fabulous and the house made tartar sauce makes the dish. Other friends have raved about the pork schnitzel. The beer list is a mile long along with having wine and spirits. It is a great casual place to eat. Service has always been top notch. The only problem is the entry is a bit awkward and if you have to wait for a table, there is no good place to do so if the bar is full.\n",
      "I like this place because of the food and the awesome large screen on the top floor for sports events. The bugersrs, etc. are delicious. French onion soup was a bit of a bust, though. It came out late and had a whole wonderbread + campbell's soup mix feeling to it.\n",
      "This was our first trip to Cooper's Tavern, and my husband and I decided to bring our parents with us. It seemed pretty small on the inside and we had 6 people in our party, but it was 5:30 on a Monday evening & not too crowded so we were able to be seated right away. Our server was very quick and attentive. He was very helpful when my dad needed help choosing a beer and ended up recommending the perfect one for him. He continued to provide excellent service throughout our meal! Everyone in our party loved the food they ordered, and we all got something different. My husband had the buttered chicken and practically inhaled it he enjoyed it so much. I had the pork belly mac. The macaroni was cooked perfectly and the cheese was delicious. The pork belly that was served on top of the pasta was incredible. I savored every last bite of it. I stole some frites from my mom and those were also delicious. I really considered giving a 4 star review simply because the place was so noisy and felt pretty cramped at times, but the food was so delicious and the service was great, I think a 5 star review is well-deserved! If you're in a larger group I would suggest going during the week, or sitting outside on the patio. We will definitely recommend it in the future to those looking for a unique place to eat on the square!\n",
      "Excellent~ good beer selection. I had the Veggie sandwich: roasted zucchini, red peppers, carrots and portobello mushrooms on wheatberry bread with hummus, feta, and oven-dried tomatoes...comes with chips or salad. LOVED it! Only downfall is on a busy night where some folks are just there to drink, the setup of tables and standing room makes it difficult to navigate through. Enjoy!\n",
      "Hm. First I hit three stars, then four...and back to three. I've been here twice, once was intentionally for brunch, and another for lunch. I'd go again if someone suggested it, but it's not at the top of my list. Everyone seemed happy with their food choices, and the menu is interesting. My last dish was the sweet potato chili. Flavorful and spicy, but thick for my taste. Cornbread was less than memorable. Service was nice, and the food came out lickety-split. Also, the server didn't roll his eyes(can't say the same for myself) when my boyfriend's mom had to be explained what a \"shot of soup\" is. Um, it's a shot. Nope, not a small cup. It's a shot glass--and then she asked for a spoon for her shot. Oy. That alone almost deserves a star.\n",
      "This is my go-to place on the square for drinks. They have an amazing beer selection and the waitstaff and bartenders are always really personable. I usually go with my boyfriend, and if we get food, we usually split something, as the entrees are a little pricier. We like to be adventurous so a few months back we ordered the bone marrow. It was my first time eating it and it was the first time I've ever ordered something I couldn't eat. It is served in the bone and for some reason, that made it unpalatable to me. It doesn't affect my rating, though, as every other dish we have tried has been excellent. The only major gripe I have is that they don't take reservations. I get that they are on the square and will fill up quickly without reservations, but there have been many times I've had to go elsewhere because the wait is 2 hours+. I would love to take friends there when they visit us in Madison, but the wait is just too long. We usually end up going on weekdays to get our beers. Overall, awesome place with a few minor pitfalls. They don't keep us from returning, though.\n",
      "Yum! I definitely enjoyed my brunch here this afternoon. I had the salmon lok and it was damn delicious. Anything with smoked salmon on it I have to try, and I am so glad I did. It came on toast with cream cheese and capers. Very yummy. My girlfriends tried the Coopers Burger and the French Onion soup and said it hit the spot. Decent service for the most part, and the food came out quickly, which I always like! It was a nice enough day so we ate on the patio. I didn't get much of a chance to check out the inside, but I would like to see more of it next time. I like that this place is a little bit off state street because its close enough that you can be part of the party, but also not in the way of anyone. You don't have to deal with drunk people stumbling around your food or too much noisiness. They have cute flower decorations on the tables as well as candles.\n",
      "From 3 to 4 stars and I'll give ya 2 reasons why, then 1 reason why it's not a 5... yet. 3-to-4 1. One of the better burgers on The Square. (When you take Tornado out of the equation.) Juicy, loaded if you want, nice bun that holds up to monstrous meat. 2. Left Hand Milk Stout on tap with the imprint of a left hand in the heady foam. (Score!) Seriously. I know it won't be around for long, seems like an awesome winter brew maybe not something to guzzle come June, but man, it's a good thing. 1-from-5 Variety is the spice of life. So switch it up yo. I find the menu a bit limiting and wish it rotated, I'd probably be by more if there were reason (foodish reasons).\n",
      "My new favorite bar & grill! Tasteful decor, great selection of beer, and good mussels & fries. What more could you ask for? Staff is very knowledgeable about their inventory, and it's not hard to find a place to sit. Excellent!\n",
      "If you're near the square swing into coopers, friendly staff and the owner is a really nice and genuine guy! Great tap beer selection too.\n",
      "I'll continue bringing friends to Cooper's mainly because of the great selection of beers. I've tried several new brews here thanks to great bartenders who are more than willing to offer suggestions. As mentioned, the service here is excellent. The ambiance is okay - not quite as comfortable as a place like Genna's, but also not overly busy like the Old Fashioned can sometimes get. I haven't eaten here yet, so I will update this once I do. For now, it's a very solid spot to come try new beers and converse with friends.\n",
      "Visiting from Ca and not having the tavern/pub atmosphere, I have become a big fan. I loved The Cooper Tavern. We had the Duck Wings and Kobe Sliders which both were awesome. We were disappointed the soft pretzels had not been delivered for the day so we didn't get to try them. Our server Chaz was nice but was just to busy visiting with the bartender and didn't spend enough time with his tables.\n",
      "Went for breakfast. Awesome food. We got to sit in the private room and enjoy friends' company. Great food and drinks.\n",
      "We went here for brunch on a glorious Sunday morning and sat outside (no wait, even though it was Ride the Drive and the tail end of Walkerville) . It was just what I needed to eat off my hangover. Our waitress was sweet, quick and efficient. My water was always full -- perfect. I got the asparagus/ some-kind-of-good-cheese quiche, which came with a tasty arugula salad. Nice and fluffy, every bit delicious. Love this place.\n",
      "I came to Cooper's Tavern today with high hopes! Last time I went, the food and service was great. Today, I wouldn't know if the food was great because I never got it. Well, I got my iced tea and my friend got her frites(which are rather tasty), but after almost an hour after ordering sandwiches, we asked for a check for just the drinks and frites because we just wanted to leave. This was maybe the third time we spoke to our waitress? I don't remember her name, but she is a short redhead. Very unfriendly, and never managed to actually put our order in. After asking for the check, she came back out and said it was on the house and we were free to go, confirming that our lunch order had never actually been put in. We both left pretty pissed off. I won't be going back any time soon.\n",
      "We went to Coopers on Saturday because the go-to burger and fries place we had tried first is by the Kohl Center. There was a game and it was wall to wall in there. We ended up having a better burger, better fries and great beer at Cooper's. We split the Cooper's burger which was just right for the two of us. (My wife is a pretty light eater.) The burger came with red onions, pork belly, pickles, and lettuce. The bun was just right and meat was cooked perfectly. The fries were plentiful and perfectly crisp on the outside, moist in the middle. The aioli is tangy and light. Cooper's Tavern hit the spot just right for a Saturday burger lunch.\n",
      "\"More than just a watering hole. Large selection of beers (28 on tap alone) and a interesting and flavorful menu. Sunday breakfast menu also provides selections for vegetarian and meatatarians as well.\n",
      "I came here between 5-7 times within a month's time, so I have a pretty good idea of what they have and more importantly, the consistency of the food. Firstly, the food is freaking amazing. Probably because anything with beef and/or cheese is out of this world in Wisconsin, compared to California. My favorites were the Fish and Chips, and the Rocket Sliders (by a landslide). Secondly, they have an ever-rotating selection of micro-brews that were unlike most of the stuff I can get back in California, especially one of the most amazing beers I've had the chance to taste - Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Overall, this was my staple go-to restaurant, and sometimes find myself missing it.\n",
      "Awful food. Horrible date place. Too loud. Beer list rarely changes. This is the place you go to to break up with someone.\n",
      "Good beer, BUT bad, bad food. Had horrible poutine - which is sad considering that Wisconsin cheese curds should have been the bomb but instead were rubbery and tasteless. Tomato red pepper soup was inedible, salads were anemic. Everything else was microwaved and/or canned. Bills itself as a gastropub, but instead gave me gastroenteritis...\n",
      "Really love the place. The Coopers Burger is a great lunchtime meal and if you are into soccer or World sports, this is the place to be. This is the usual hangout for Liverpool FC fans in Madison.\n",
      "What a great experience! Our group of 50 people, in town for a corporate sales dinner, was displaced after another local restaurant \"forgot\" about our reservation. We were welcomed without hesitation and the staff made us feel at home and they took great care of us. Their upstairs room is awesome and everyone enjoyed their meals. What could have been a big bust of a night was saved by the friendly staff, yummy food and great atmosphere at The Coopers Tavern!\n",
      "My friend and I stumbled upon this place and were pretty impressed with the menu so we decided to get brunch there. I loved the atmosphere inside, though we chose to sit outside as we had a front row view of the capital. We started with some bloody mary's and, well, yum. Fixin's galore and they came with a beer chaser (craft beer, not sure which) which was a nice added touch. Then I ordered the Scandinavian Benedict. It was pretty tasty. Part of the salmon looked/tasted a little skunky but I moved around that part and finished the rest. My friend, however--her veggie sandwich was SO good. The veggies were all chopped up, which was unique to me. And the flavors were spot on. The feta, hummus and dried tomatoes added so much. I would definitely go back here.\n",
      "Good and consistent. A little small, so it's hard to get a seat on the weekends. They have very flavorful fish and chips.\n",
      "Great food for lunch. Lots of options. Service is sometimes a little cold... Bordering on rude.\n",
      "I moved away from Madison a month ago, and Cooper's is one of the places I most miss. I would have considered myself a regular (I dined there about once a week). The beer list is unmatched. I'd recommend asking the waiters if they've recently received anything new, because I'd frequently been able to get something obscure and great that hadn't hit the menu yet. The food is similarly excellent. Although it is simple, I would recommend the grilled cheese (the tomato soup that comes with it is a nice touch). I also regularly enjoyed the polenta and the beet hummus. Definitely sit by the window if you can. The view of the square and the capitol building is beautiful. The one slight negative: this is a small space, so when it gets crowded it gets loud. I'd recommend stopping in on a week night to get the full effect and the best service.\n",
      "Coopers is by far one of the best spots in town! My husband and I not only hosted our rehearsal dinner in their upstairs dining space, but we also stop by for their awesome beer selection, rustic elegant decor, and great customer service. We love their fish fry and beet humus. I would highly recommend checking out Coopers for private events, cocktails, brunch, or dinner. Oh, and they are also an English Premier League bar if you are a soccer fan!\n",
      "Cool atmosphere (\"coolest\" fans I've ever seen in a restaurant ;) and delicious lunch! My only gripe is that I love Amy's Salad so much that I find it hard to branch out on the menu (not to say that everything else I've tried has been wonderful too).\n",
      "What an unbelievably amazing place to go. This is by-far my favorite place to go on a slower night rather than the party scene. Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people. The owner Pete is awesome as well. All the waiters, waitresses, bar tenders, and of course Pete make you feel like family who just got home. It's an absolutely wonderful place to go. BE SURE TO TRY A DARK AND STORMY DOWN THERE!\n",
      "I went while I was traveling for work with a bunch of co-workers. We ended up buying 6 different meals so we could do family style and get a little bit of each. The place is really loud and busy, which can be expected for a pub type restaurant. I had some hard cider that was really good. The food was ok; I really liked the pretzel chicken and the cooper's burger. The chicken sandwich with chipotle sauce was pretty dry and flavorless. I tried a bite of my friends macaroni with lobster and was not a huge fan...neither was he :( The burger sliders were pretty good along with the steak frites and the pork chop. The server was courteous and she even spilt our bill for us which I know is a huge pain in the a$$. With the number of great restaurants in the area, I think I would try something different if I were to visit there again.\n",
      "I heard a lot about the place from the local people and were real excited to try it out. for appetizer, we ordered the sconnie egg. The meat was dry and quite honestly it is tasteless. They tried to add flavor by putting a lot of the mustard source on the bottom but it is too salty. I think it would have worked better with a different kind of mustard. We had the Poutine as well. This is a dish that is gaining its popularity here in the US. The fries and gravy are good but the cheese are sticking together but overall it is a B+. As for dinner we ordered the hamburger. The meat was tough. Hands down The Old Fashion is a lot better. The up side there are a big selection of beer and it is a cool place just to hang out for a pint or two with no food please.\n",
      "This place has a cool vibe both inside and out, a tremendous draft and bottle list, and savory food. The wait staff was super-helpful, and I could easily see this becoming a go-to spot for happy hour or dinner. Be sure to enjoy the appetizers of cheese-gravy fries, or more healthy options like a veggie and hummus platter. Will definitely be back!\n",
      "Awesome food and atmosphere. The owner Peter is a gracious host. The menu is interesting and the service is outstanding. The food was perfectly prepared and delicious.\n",
      "Okay, I feel guilty for giving this place only two stars because it seems like a four star place on paper but......... So the menu is great, but the food quality is very inconsistent. I have tried almost half the menu and have ordered the same item (brisket sandwich for one) on different occasions and had very different results!! The pretzels and cheese are a decent app. The fish fry is solid. As for everything else well, ehhhh. The wait staff is always very friendly, but the knowledge of the menu and the beer list is not where it should be. The menu isn't that complicated and at times the staff doesn't seem to have a very in-depth knowledge of the items. The shotgun style lay-out isn't great for large groups, but if it's just you and a few buddies, this is a great place to go and tip a few. Hopefully as they become more established, the consistency will come and this place will turn into a madison staple! It has the potential!!\n",
      "I've eat here a couple times and it was fantastic. The menu is nice and short, but you can't go wrong with the selections. Save your decision make for what to drink. Location: Great view of the Capitol right in the square. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. You be sharing stories with your neighbors. Food: I've only had lunch but the Poutine was yummy. I can't believe we didn't invent that before the neighbors to the North. Turkey sandwich Is fantastic and nothing beats homemade chips. Drinks: if you can't find something you like then there us something wrong with you. 28 beers on tap with over a hindered in the bottle. 40 different wines if that is your poison. I had the Hennipen from Coopers Town delicious.\n",
      "Amazing beer list that goes for pages, food that has not yet disappointed, and friendly staff that ensures you are having a great experience. New local favorite.\n",
      "I've eaten at The Cooper's Tavern many times in the past couple of years... I've definitely noticed a decline in the level of service. My husband and I ate here this evening at the bar. The bar staff ignored us for most of the evening. We had to flag staff down to ask for waters on two separate occasions. After my husband finished his beer, he waited at least half an hour to get a water. The food definitely isn't good enough to make up for the poor service. It wasn't busy-- one of the bartenders even had time to pull their phone out and text for a few minutes.\n",
      "I love Coop's! It's one of my go-to places for a dinner downtown with friends. They have a great beer selection, and the waitstaff is happy to bring you a sample of anything you've not had before. As simple as it is, I love their grilled cheese and harvest (tomato and red pepper) soup in the cooler months. Thick, crusty bread with a few different cheeses and hot soup to dip in-- perfect comfort food. When opting to go a little healthier, I love their sweet corn Caesar salad. It's flavorful, with green onions and red and poblano peppers on top, along with sweet kernels of fresh corn. In the past, when I've added chicken, there was one time that it was over-salted, but I've ordered it at least a dozen times, so I forgave it as a fluke. Everything else has been wonderful too, they have a delicious selection of sandwiches, and their dinner entrees have been great too. Seating can get cozy when they're busy, but it's never bugged me. And if you have a group of 5-8 people, see if you can get the snug! It's a really interesting and fun dining experience, as long as you're ok with sitting on benches.\n",
      "Spending two hours rallying really works up a girl's appetite, so I decided to come and try this place out, as I've been meaning to for awhile and been too lazy to leave my hermit cave of an apartment. I ordered the Cooper's Burger and it was pretty good: grass-fed beef, pork belly, some fresh lettuce and a nice aioli to taste. The food was easily four stars and was pretty good. The bathrooms are kept very clean (although, there's only one). The service is also pretty decent; I've seen some inconsistencies here about it and I was a little weary before I walked in, but I must've been lucky and came on a good day because my waiter and the manager were both quite friendly. This place is pretty small and some of the seating is kind of awkward; I was placed inbetween two groups by myself when there was plenty of other seats elsewhere. I'm sure it might've been easier on the waiters, but it was just kind of weird to be seated next to a family and two guys talking about finances. Also, the alcohol list is pretty nice; at least 3 pages on beer alone. Kind of hot, actually, even if I'm not huge on beer. That said, it's a pretty affordable place, the service is relatively friendly if you come in on a good day, and it's got a nice view of the capitol. But I'd avoid bringing large groups of people and kids--don't think this is a good place for either.\n",
      "Adorable place near the capital. Tons of seating and multiple bars (two levels). Great feel, old wood and historical looking. We only had drinks here, but the food I saw looked really good! Check it out, for sure!\n",
      "[This review is based on two meals, dinner last year and brunch last week.] Meal 1: Dinner I've stepped into Coopers a few times hoping to have a beer with some colleagues but it's always been so crowded that we've gone elsewhere. Finally went for dinner tonight with my wife and was quite disappointed. As many other reviewers have mentioned, Coopers has a horrible layout and always feels cramped, so we decided to sit outside, even though it was unseasonably chilly. Service: Ok. The waitress was very nice, though she forgot to bring us water the first time we asked for it. She also didn't tell us the specials (although the host had when we were looking at the menu and deciding whether or not to dine there, so perhaps he told her that ) but ultimately she redeemed herself (more on that later.) Drinks: My wife and I both ordered a mojito, even though it was pretty cold out. Big mistake, and not just because of the weather. The drinks were watery and the mint was wilting and brownish which made it seem like a large glass of rotting leaves. But booze is booze and I could have overlooked this. Menu: Coopers has what looks to be an incredible menu. There were a number of items that sounded really good and I was already plotting my return voyage while I was making my choice. But alas... Appetizer: About four months ago I tried bone marrow for the first time at Graze and was absolutely blown away. It was rich, decadent, and seemed to hold the very essence of beef in its silky embrace. I don't know if Graze is just buying much better marrow bones or if their doing something in the preparation, but the marrow at Coopers was nothing like what I had at Graze. It was flavorless and fatty, difficult to scoop out of the bone and disturbingly pink at points. It came with only four small pieces of bread, so you had to slather an enormous amount on each one (which, by the way, so many restaurants do and i don't know why... bread is cheap.) Speaking of bread-- I appreciated that the waitress warned us that the appetizer would take 20 minutes to prepare (although I wonder why this isn't written on the menu). I would have appreciated it even more if she would have offered us some bread or something to munch on while we drained our watery mojitos. As it turned out, Coopers has some really good baguettes. In any case, all that is a minor complaint compared to... The Entrees: 1. Pork Belly Mac and Cheese- I ordered this one, and kind of liked the first bite. But after two or three bites I just couldn't go in-- it was overwhelmingly sweet. The pork belly sweetness would have been a good thing if it was offset by the sharpness of the cheddar. But its not. In fact, I'm not even sure that this was cheddar at all, though the menu claimed it was. It tasted like the sweet ricotta filling that you get in a cannoli. When my wife tried it she had the exact same experience. She proclaimed the first bite to be \"delicious,\" then put down her fork after two more, gagging on the sweetness. 2. Beef Stew on \"Dumplings\" My wife ordered this. It was terrible. Really, really terrible. A thin layer of spaetzle is not what I (or anyone) would expect by \"dumplings.\" The beef looked like poop and didn't taste much better. The Resolution: The waitress came to the table when we had both eaten about 20% of our meal. We said that we were finished and she asked if we would like our food wrapped up. When we said no, she said that must be because we were so full. No, I said. The food just wasn't good. She comped us for the entrees which was the right thing to do. MEAL #2: Brunch My parents were in town and we were looking for a place to grab brunch before we left. Again, everything on the menu looked really good. Again, it really wasn't. I ordered eggs benedict. I don't know how you could possibly make a hollandaise sauce that ins't tasty, but Coopers managed it. The corn beef hash my dad ordered was also just bizarre-- it looked like little shreds of corn beef and was garnished, rather bizarrely, with fruit. The waiter was really fantastic and the atmosphere was nice, but once again the flavors just weren't there. I highly doubt we'll be going back.\n",
      "You know you're in trouble when the beer menu is longer than the food menu. And when I say \"trouble\" you know I mean \"paradise\". Our server was quite knowledgeable and was able to describe various beers and helped steer us towards things we'd like and may not have noticed or tried. The place was bustling with an energetic dinner crowd on a Tuesday night, but fortunately we were seated immediately. The interior is casual and charming, it feels inviting with the wood floors, old fashioned triple ceiling fan and brick walls. We started with the fresh baked soft pretzels ($3.95) which I can't say I'd try again. They tasted more like simply bread sticks than pretzels. Fortunately the pretzel roll served with the burger seemed much more on target! Whew. Being the family veg, I was pleased there were several vegetarian items on the menu, including several soup options (yay!). I opted for a bowl of the Sweet Potato Chili ($6.95) which was hearty and had enough (but not too much) of a kick. While there were several vegetarian entrees (grilled veggie sandwich, grilled cheese, or venetian manicotti) I elected for a salad (cue anti-climatic music). Fortunately, my salad itself was not anti-climatic. The house salad ($5.95) was a perfect size and sported freshly grated Parmesan and croutons. AND a chunk of sourdough bread (yup, this on TOP of my cornbread with my soup - this carb lover's dreams DO come true!). And true to form, the Mister declared his Cooper's Burger delish - I've been hearing about the \"pork belly\" topping ever since. Ah yes, yet another place the vegetarian & carnivore can dine in peace.\n",
      "Oh, the dulcet tones of RE CALL WALK ER while we attempted to enjoy our al fresco dinner. Which isn't to say that I disagree with the sentiment - just that it interfered with the otherwise very pleasant ambiance of Coopers Tavern. We stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago on the recommendation of our Airbnb host - when he learned we liked beer, he insisted that we try Coopers. We were grateful for the recommendation!. I really enjoyed the Irish Cobb salad - house-cured corned beef, oven-dried tomatoes, asparagus, hard-boiled egg, Dubliner, and scallion-mustard dressing - but we were disappointed in the beer cheese pretzels, as the \"dip\" was more like soup. I'm not sure where to rate the service, exactly. I think our server was new, but she was definitely enthusiastic, peppering us for our drink order before we'd had a chance to open the menu. When my husband asked about a beer listed on the menu, she informed him that they were out but it was SO GOOD. Very helpful! He really wanted the beer, and now would obviously have to take his drinking dollars elsewhere if he wanted to try something that was obviously recommended. Despite that overly grumpy digression, we'd definitely give this place another shot.\n",
      "We have been eating a Cooper's ever since opened. Although I am not a fan of Food Fight. Group, this restaurant is the one exception to the usual mediocrity of FF. My favorite salad is the Amy's with the Sweet Corn Ceasar a close second. The Veggie sandwich is the best in town. British Chicken Curry is amazing, the grilled cheese sandwich with a shot of tomato soup for dipping is great. The beer is always cold and a great selection. Cooper's is a perfect pub experience.\n",
      "I had a chance to grab lunch here earlier today and let me say that I am a fan. It has a homey feel, staff is very friendly and the turkey sandwich, while not the best and a bit overpriced, was decent enough. The biggest pro is the down to earth environment and the alcohol selection. One con: They had a soccer game on the TV. I'd definitely give this place a go, though. Especially at night or during a big sports game.\n",
      "I have come here plenty of times, so I figured it was time to give it a review. Ever since I stumbled on this place, I have always enjoyed each subsequent visit. They serve Neapolitan pizzas that originates from Italy instead of the more traditional American versions like thin crust New York Style, Chicago deep dish, fancy California pizzas, etc. They have a varied menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts, so there are plenty of options for anyone to find something to suit their tastes. I normally tend to get their margherita, crushed tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, basil, and parmigiano reggiano, and their Settebello, a pizza similar to the margherita but with sausage, pancetta and mushrooms. I am always looking for a good cannoli and the one that they serve here is exceptional, especially coming from a pizza place. As I am regularly pleased with their food and service, my only complaint is that the bottoms of their pizzas can be soggy and limp at times. Even when it does happen, which isn't often, the pizza still tastes awesome. If you are a fan of pizza, and are looking for something different than your regular New York style or Chicago style joint, this would be a good addition to your pizza rotation.\n",
      "Pizza was super tasty I got the Pizza Carbonara and man was it delicous, maybe one of the tastiest pizza's ive ever had, they had a nice selection of tasty beers that I enjoyed, restaurant looked very clean inside and well designed. I'll definitely be making a stop there next time im in the vegas area.\n",
      "I love Settebello. The new location is super close to home. The only drawback is I always end up spending too much money on dinner, but it's always delicious!\n",
      "Items Selected: Arancini - Risotto, Peas, Smoked Mozzarella di Bufala, Cured Meats over Tomato Sauce and Parmigiano Margherita DOC - Tomato, Mozzarella di Bufala, Parmigiano, Basil, Olio Diavola - Tomato, Red Bell Peppers, Spicy Salami, Crushed Red Pepper, Garlic, Mozzarella, Basil, Olio Rafael - Salame, Garlic, Roasted Onions, Mozzarella, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil, Olio Pizza Carbonara - Tomatoes, Pacetta, Egg, Cracked Pepper, Parmigiano, Mozzarella, Basil, Olio Settebello - Tomatoes, Pancetta, Sausage, Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Olio Zeppole - Donuts Filled with Nutella and Coated in Sugar Caramel Budino - House made Caramel Pudding, Salted Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream, House Made Almond Orange Cookie Bella Mela - Sweetened Vanilla Mascarpone over Baked Pizza Bread topped with Fresh Cinnamon Apples, Caramel Sauce, Powdered sugar, Sliced Almonds S'mores Calzone More and more well versed with \"VPN-Style\" and the questionable certification process involved as time goes on I have come to realize that this decidedly un-American pizza is an acquired taste as even some of my most well-traveled and trusted friends are not particularly fond of the pools of mozzarella and often liquid center but with that in mind it was a pleasure to meet with four like-minded pizza pals on Saturday at the only 'authentic' VPN pizzeria in Las Vegas, the newest outpost of SLC's Settebello. Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success. Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats. Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.\n",
      "The service was great and the food was good. I've been to their Green Valley location twice before in the past and while I did enjoy my food at the Fort Apache location, it wasn't nearly as good as the original location. I'm not saying that it was bad but I didn't get that same \"WOW\" feeling that I got when I ate at the Green Valley location and I rather not pay that much for pizza unless it was as good as I had before.\n",
      "Amazing pizza and an absolutely stellar drink selection. Beautifully crafted and unique.\n",
      "Personally,I love this type of pizza. A little wet in the middle with a chewy burnt crust. I've been to both locations and the food is equally as good. This one just happens to be closer to my house. Also, I really like the wait staff here. I wish I had asked the guy's name who waited on us tonight. He was so awesome. Made a great drink recommendation and was very enjoyable. Most pizzas average around $12. They are 12\" I believe. So consider them shareable or just a large personal ;)\n",
      "This is our hands-down favorite pizza place in town. We are locals and come here frequently. The pizza is delish, the salads are sooooo good, they ALWAYS have a Polygamy Porter on nitro for my hubby and a fabulous glass of Malbec for me. Andrew is our favorite waiter, with good reason. He (and everyone there) is attentive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile for us. We are regulars here, and I see no reason to not be. If you're not a regular here, you are missing out.\n",
      "I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of Settebello in Summerlin for some time now and jumped at the chance to go last Wednesday. I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected. It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good. Let's start off with the restaurant itself. The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area. I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times. $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that. So my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual. I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie. Then the pizzas came out. My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade. I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead. I should've stuck with the Settebello. Why mess with perfection? Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping. Funnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah. I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away. Hmmmmm. Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be. But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best. My wife's margherita was great. I still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars.\n",
      "Came here on a Thursday night with a group of 10 people. We started off with drinks at the bar as we waited for everyone to get there. The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun. When we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy. The pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it. We did have a little mix up with the bills at the end due to our switching from the bar to the dining area. All in all, great time here. Props to the staff here for letting us ourselves while maintaining a family atmosphere for the rest of the customers.\n",
      "I'm so fancayyy, you already know..... My husband heard good things about this place through co-workers and friends, so we decided to have lunch here one day before catching a movie next door. It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, \"something with meat.\" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu. I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put \"contains raw egg\" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said \"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with....\" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right?? Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!\n",
      "Four stars because while having lunch here today my first thoughts were that the establishment is beautiful while walking in, the staff is attentive and friendly and on Monday's you can get a pizza for $5. The end crust of the pizza was good but the bottom of the pizza was so soggy and gross. I'd only give the pizza maybe two stars.\n",
      "Heard great things about this place. It did not disappoint. If you want a thin crust pizza that folds and places a giant smile on your face, this is it. Great service, great value\n",
      "Best pizza that we've had in Vegas in a long time- very authentic. Reminds me of New York. Margherita was awesome! And the Jalapeno Pear was a different take but very tasty- a little on the spicy side with the salami so be forewarned if you have issue with spicy food - two thumbs up!\n",
      "ATMOSPHERE: My friend and I came in during a slow part of the day as we were the only ones to sit down for an early dinner. However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through. The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant. FOOD: The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style. I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice. Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp. It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall. SERVICE: Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu. It was a well run service, nothing truly remarkable but certainly beats many other restaurants I've been to where the service truly lacked.\n",
      "Was very disappointing in this place. I ordered one of the white pizzas and it was flavorless. The risotto balls and salad were just ok. Service was extremely slow. My waitress took my glass of water to fill and never returned it. I noticed other customers coming in, and then leaving because they were never attended to.\n",
      "Very mediocre pizza. I've tried this place two different times, with similar results. They don't know how to regulate their ovens, so their pizza comes out soggy. We had to send ours back two times and we gave up. They have excellent salads, they are friendly and give good service. I understand Monday's are a good time to go...I'm not sure I have pizza forgiveness\n",
      "Pizza place located in village square! The decor is beautiful. Excellent drink menu! I ordered the margarita pizza, paid $10. Idk what it was, but I didn't care for the crust. It was a little too doughy for my liking, but the actually pizza minus the crust was awesome! I loved that flavor. It tasted really fresh and the cheese was great. I'll have to come back and try the meatballs\n",
      "The Neapolitan pizza is different than what I am used to. It is a good crust, but I still like a thin crisp crust. Their menu for the pizza and the salads has unusual combinations. The staff is very nice and helpful. I like the interior and the atmosphere. It is that combo of modern and friendly that works. Yes, I will be back!\n",
      "Thank you, Las Vegas - finally!!! A cute, trendy restaurant that does not break the bank, not on the strip, and is freaken good!!!!! A big group of 16 people had reservations for a private room. The moscato and the settlebello pizza were phenomenal! The crust was not too thick, the flavor was amazing, and the pizza was 12 inches - good to share! The fried risotto was also pretty amazing! Our waitress was pretty good so no complaints there. I had a great time and I was happy happy happy!!!\n",
      "I have been on a quest to find great Pizza, unfortunately this is not. I gave it one stars because it did have flavor but the crust is chewy and it reminded me of pita bread Not good. You can't pick a slice up with your hands. If you like Napoletana pizza this might be ok although I have never been to Naples. I haven't been to the Henderson location but I didn't think it will be much better. Everyone has an opinion and we all have our own taste. The reviews that were 5 stars I can't for the life of me understand why unless they don't know great pizza. Chicago and New York have great pizza and I will continue to search. ( Check this one off the list)\n",
      "This is the best pizza place ever. Service was ok. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their \"Margherita\"!\n",
      "Review for new location on Sahara and Fort Apache: Loved the traditional Napoli pizza; it was on point! If people are complaining, they are not used to the real thing and need a trip to Italy to explore another part of the world. This restaurant is certified as well. The ambiance was lovely, modern with a warm, comfortable twist. Though the layout is quite open, it was still quiet enough to hear the person seated across from you. This restaurant could easily accommodate a group of 8 -10 for lunch/dinner. My friend dined here for a late lunch the week before, and he said their Happy Hour prices and specials were surprisingly decent. I will give it a try in the next few weeks. The server was amazing - attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, and inviting. As many of us know, great servers are a rare breed now-a-days in LV as most act like they are doing their guests a favor in the land of Make a Living Off Your Tips. This was also nice to find at a new, trendy, hotspot in Vegas. (Server was Josh - he remembered my guy friend's name and is unfortunately going to the Henderson location permanently). The timing of the food was perfect, the quality was great, and the price was reasonable. Everything I tasted was delicious - not too much, not bland, and authentic.\n",
      "Definitely one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. Due to the business ups and downs staffing could be an issue sometimes, but the wait is totally worth it !\n",
      "Went to the GV recommendation of a friend. This pizza reminds me of pizza I had in Italy. We had the Settebello pizza with pine nuts pancetta, mushrooms sausage- so good! And the salad was great too .. But don't remember the name and the tiramisu was perfect!! The pizza doesn't come precut and don't compare to NY pizza .. it's in a class by it's own.\n",
      "I like thin crust pizza, but more crispy would be better. I had the marghrita and it was too oily and soggy for my taste. Salame plate was excellent. Service was mediocrity at best. Felt rushed out door. No offer for dessert or coffee. Oh well. Won't be back.\n",
      "This place had such potential. Good location. Nice ambiance. But we have had a couple of bad experiences now and won't be going back. 1. There is no pepperoni. 2. Their salads taste like a pine tree and not in a good way. 3. The service was really slow. We finally got out of there after 2 1/2 hours. We went on a weekend night and there were only a few other people dining, but we were not attended to very well. There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected. 4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better. 5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks. 6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMI We will not be going back. But in all fairness, if you still want to try it, at least they have coke products and their bathrooms are nice.\n",
      "Monday is Margherita pizza day!! $5!!! The pizza is absolutely incredible. Today we paired it with a panzanella salad. It was fresh and crisp. The service is delightful!\n",
      "A very good option when you want a relaxing and delicious meal away from the strip...especially if you're on your way out to or back from red Rock.\n",
      "The pizza at Settebello is amazing and there are so many unique toppings to choose from. Settebello offers pizza and salads (and a full bar) but this is an amazing Italian atmosphere to relax and enjoy great food and service!\n",
      "This is a beautiful place, the service was friendly, attentive, and as far as I'm concerned can't be improved on. We stopped in for some pizzas and I just wasn't impressed. We got a carbonarra which had 4 slices if pancetta and maybe 3 small leaves if basil on it, not enough for me. The eggs are scrambled which really killed it for me. The cheese was just a little light but not a problem. We also had the mageritta DOC and 5 slivers of cheese is not enough for me on that either. I like these pizzas a little thicker and more sauce so you can scoop it all up with the crust. The dough was tasty and cooked very well. Prices are right about par for a place like this. I've had better wood fired pizza here locally and I do not go to pizza house for the decor.\n",
      "Stopped in one afternoon after touring some nearby apartments. The pizza was delicious and the staff was helpful and friendly. We got a couple different pizzas and both were really nice. The prices weren't outrageous either. Great place to stop before or after a movie!\n",
      "I came here with my family for their promotion of $5 margarita pizzas at this location every Monday! According to their menu, their pizza is freshly hand crafted cooked in a 900 degree wood burner for about a minute. I ordered the original margarita pizza. It's a pretty decent size for 1 or 2 people. The dough was very thin and soft and the blend of their crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, parmigiana, basil and olio was beautifully tasted amazing. I really liked the atmosphere and their huge wooden tables. The lighting felt perfect for the dinner setting and it was not too dark or too bright. The service was exceptional but very slow at refilling drinks. Overall I've enjoyed this pizzeria and would come back again. Thank you!\n",
      "I LOVE this place. I went on Friday night ....we were a party of three. Had to wait....they were packed. Friendly staff. Great waitress...really nice and seemed to enjoy her job. We ordered the warm beet salad and three pizzas. I had the Rafael....out of this world...best pizza I have ever had in this town. My friends were happy with their pizzas too. There were lots of families...and kids...so it's not a quiet place. Great food and great prices. Very fair. Loved the atmosphere too.\n",
      "Authentic Neapolitan Pizza and a Whiskey mule in a copper jar. Bring it. My brother in law is Italian. Like Italian Italian. He melts at this joint. I melt for the cocktails. Strip mall location, so meh there, but damn good.\n",
      "This is the best pizza in Las Vegas. The Diavola pizza I believe is my favorite of all time. The Margherita DOC is also delicious with the creamy buffalo mozarella. I have to have it at least once a week. The Panzanella salad goes good on top of the pizza. I was never a fan of fennel until the I tried the salad. The service is great. The food rivals Napoli's best pizza. If you're looking for authentic Neapolitan pizza you have to try this. Writing this review is making me hungry!\n",
      "Not a good experience. You know you're in trouble when you walk in to a place and you're greeted by three different people who offer to help you but then none of them do. All I wanted to do was pick up my takeout; 2 pies and a salad. I gave my card to one girl who stood with my credit card 5 feet away from me complaining to another employee about a previous customer for 3 minutes while I watched her not running my card and not getting my food. After finally handing over my food, I was asked if I wanted parmesan cheese and red peppers. You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin? Okay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about? I got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, \"these aren't cooked all the way.\" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted. On to the \"bread\" salad. There were two croutons in it. It was a sea of arugula. Back of house fail. Not sure what is going on with this place. It has all the elements of a good restaurant but the execution is way off. Whoever owns this place needs to step in quickly because the staff are not trained well and it shows. With so many pizza options, don't waste your time or money here.\n",
      "This quite possibly was the worst pizza I ever had. I cannot wrap my head around how this place has such good reviews. I ordered the bolognese pizza and the settebello. Took 40min to get pizza first off. The bolognese was disgusting. It was like eating soup pizza. Was basically raw dough in the middle. I had one slice of the bolognese and was done. The settebello was raw in the middle as well but not as bad as the bolognese. The waitress said the pizza was soft but I was not expecting raw pizza. Just a horrible texture. Bring your spoon to eat your pizza at this place.\n",
      "My italian friend recommended this place! I am always opened to try smth new in order to feed my son! Cute place, nice and fast service! Ordered traditional cheese pizza and meatballs! Everything was yammi, yammi. Pizza barely has a crust at all, so thin and those burnt crispy edges...mmmm! Meatballs were so soft and came with 2 slices of bread sprinkled with olive oil. Very happy with our lunch!\n",
      "This place is literally the best pizza joint in town. They are very traditional in their preparation and presentation. They import a lot of ingredients, and even some of their equipment directly from Italy. I eat here constantly, try the 'Misto', best appetizer ever!!\n",
      "One of the best place in Vegas to have a proper Napolitan Pizza! Also prosciutto with mini focaccia is delicious! Must try!\n",
      "Love the pizza and the fancy drinks. Everything is so fresh and fast. Great ambiance and the staff is pleasant.\n",
      "Yum! We tried This place out because of all the other good restaurants around it. It lives up to the standard set by the other nearby places. The service was great, attentive, helpful, and quick. The specialty drink menu also has a delicious Moscow mule on it. Now, let's talk about the pizza. It's very good. I love the brick oven style and this is one of the better versions of it I've had. We had the Margarita pizza and it was great. The crust is chewy and the toppings were really fresh. Can't wait to try something else off the menu next time.\n",
      "Frickin amazing, second only to Tony's Pizza Rock. Excellent pizza, good ambience with great service and staff. Get a margherita doc and the jalapeno-pear marmalade pizza you won't regret it!\n",
      "I'm no New Yorker, but this is the best pizza place I've ever been to. It's the only thing I miss about living in Vegas! The Emilia pizza melts in your mouth. There's cream, there's prosciutto, the texture is perfect...what more do you need in a pizza? The pizzas are really thin, so one person can generally polish off a whole one. YUM!\n",
      "它是一個餐廳分兩邊，一邊是吃Pizza，一邊有酒吧喝酒看 TV. 整個裝潢很休閑，服務態度也不錯，東西也可以。值得來這裡試看看！\n",
      "Pizza is better than some. The crust is soggy and pizza is difficult to eat. Decor is cool and service is good.\n",
      "Pizza was okay. Luke warm at best. Logan took my order over the phone and messed up my order and also put me down under a completely different name. He didn't bother apologizing and was overall apathetic at best. Logan: you seem lazy and like you don't like your job- maybe you should get a new one and new attitude. Trish the manager should have corrected him on the spot, she was too busy sitting down socializing at a nearby friend. I guess business is good enough here that anything goes in this place. I don't know if I'll be back here.\n",
      "I can honestly say this is, BY FAR, my favorite pizza I have ever had. I've never been to Italy but its what I would imagine pizza in Napoli is like. Every time I eat there I think of the movie Eat, Pray, Love when she can't stop eating the Pizza in Napoli because is just so good. The atmosphere is comfortable - great for a date night or a night out with the family. Love this place. Its one of my favs!\n"

      "I have been to this place three times and each time the service has gotten worse not better. Today they advertise five dollar pizza and they will claim they charged us 12 each I asked for balsamic vinegar and waited 30 minutes I will give this place one more try\n",
      "I am a local and I have been on the hunt for the perfect Italian eatery. I FOUND IT! I was invited by an Italian family to join them for a late supper. Surprisingly they have a $5 menu. I ordered Artichoke Bruschetta and a small hand made pizza at $5 each. I would have paid more!!! Guys this is the REAL DEAL. Real and authentic Italian food. Wonderful vibe and awesome servers. I will definitely be back with my family. Thanks for a truly enjoyable dining experience.\n",
      "I've had a lot of pizza from a lot of places, but settebello surpasses all of them. It is NOT like dominoes or Pizza Hut, and I mean that in a good way. everything is ridiculously well made and still comes out fast. It's perfect for a date or grabbing some beers and pizza with you boys. You can't go wrong.\n",
      "I tried this place with a friend for the first time and I thought it was great. We came here because my friends business associates are Italian and they said this place had the most authentic Italian Margherita pizza. The food was tasty and the service was impeccable. We ate on the bar side and even with bar guests, the bartender was very attentive. He gave suggestions for pizza which we went with: mozzarella & tomatoes salad, Margherita pizza and the white pizza with jalapeño jelly and spicy salami and red onions (sorry, could remember the name). The food came out quickly and the ambiance was really nice. I look forward to going back in the next week or so.\n",
      "A large group of us visited here for the first time and were not that impressed. The restaurant itself was nice as was the service. We ordered a number of things including three different salads, a bruschetta appetizer and three different pizzas. The salads and appetizer were solid. The pizza was a letdown. The dough was very flimsy and seemingly undercooked. The toppings were okay but the pizza itself was almost room temperature. If we ever return we will be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked well done.\n",
      "The Margherita pizza at this place tasted so close to what we had in Napoli. I have been looking for a spot, where I can have an authentic Napoletana pizza and this place came really close. Although, the middle part of the pizza was a little soft and soggy and the crust was slightly burnt, which added a bitter taste to the pizza. I can overlook those tiny flaws. However, I cannot overlook the non-attentive or shall I say non-existent server. We're not in Italia so I didn't expect the customer service to be lacking. Once the server got our order, we never saw the server again. We needed extra napkins and more water, but there was no sign of the server anywhere. There was a few people on the other side of the room that looked like they work there, but it was a bit awkward to flag them down since they were preoccupied with their conversations. There were only two other tables with customers along with ours and we were all pretty much ignored. The server came back when we were done with our food and at that point, we got the bill. I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in Vegas?! It's such a shame since the pizza was so good.\n",
      "Excellent Neapolitan style pizza and excellent service. This restaurant is large, airy, clean and welcoming. Recommend highly.\n",
      "Searched for top pizza places in Vegas but didn't see this one on the list, which was surprising. The pizza was classic Neapolitan. Soft and chewy interior crust and light and crisper edges. Good selections, nice atmosphere and great service. Put this on your list if you're on the west side of town.\n",
      "The pizza bolognese wasn't anything out of the ordinary the pizza crust was thin but not crisp it was a bit soggy and the taste was okay. We also got the only pasta available it had bits of asparagus nothing special there isn't a lot of variety. Service was good.\n",
      "Went there for dinner place is nicely put together. Sat at the pizza bar ( which gets really hot after a while) and ordered a pizza and some salads all was good. They have a wood fired oven which is where they cook their pizzas. I will be going back definitely and try their other dishes. The only downfall is the place was pretty loud.\n",
      "I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, but I think Settebello has made me a convert! I met some friends for lunch there this weekend, and had a really great meal. They are experienced Settebello diners, and we ordered 3 pizzas to share among us. We arrived just after they opened, and were seated right away. The restaurant itself is lovely and airy. Service was friendly and conversational. We ordered the settebello, the bianca, and another pizza that was not listed on the menu (I believe it is called the \"Raphael\"). All of them were delicious. The dough tasted fresh, the ingredients were delicious, and I didn't even mind that the crust was thin- it wasn't too hard and crunchy. I am glad that Settebello is on the west side of the valley, and I'm sure I will return!\n",
      "My favorite italian pizza in town! Great service and the authentic \"pizza napletana\" Must try:-)\n",
      "My boyfriend and my first time here and we loooooove it!!! The atmosphere and food is great and has a yummy cocktail menu with great prices!\n",
      "Settebello is one of those restaurants that you come to on weekday afternoon and find it filled with the Real Housewives of Summerlin. Pizza here is a fork and knife experience: It's beautiful and impeccably decorated and full of cute (if I was 16, I'd say hot), young dudes. The space is filled with several booths and tables and a separate bar area. All of which are super comfy. The menu is limited: there's pizza, salads, desserts, antipasti, and several wines. Pizzas range between $8-13.50 and are 12 inches. (Pro-tip: ask for it sliced, as this dish is served in traditional Napoli style). My hot lunch date was my Gammy. She was pretty smitten with the boys & was flirting with them (and well received). You go, Gammy and you go, Glen Coco! We were promptly seated and our server was over in a jiffy. Drinks came the next second and pizza was ordered. First and foremost, I am a simple pizza girl. I just like plain old cheese. I ordered the pizza with the Buffalo Mozzarella (I'm a sucker for it), basil, crushed tomatoes, some other cheeses, and oili. It was simple. The crust in the middle is very, very thin. Making oversized NYC foldable slices seem like reinforced bricks, hence the need for fork and knife. The dough was delicious. Crispy in the crust and gooey in the middle (not underdone bread gooey either). My Gammy got the Pizza Bolognese. It was so good, it smelt and tasted like spaghetti in pizza form. My Gammy was sad when she found out they didn't have any actual pasta dishes there. She loved the sauce and she's picky and a New Yorker. Settebello has been on my list forever and I got to finally check it off and was not disappointed. Solid food, slightly inflated prices, lots of eye candy, and nice ambience. It's definitely a gem.\n",
      "We love this place!! My boyfriend was born and raised in Italy and is so happy to find the only place with authentic Neapolitan style pizza here in Vegas. The food and cocktails are fantastic, as well as the consistent service. We have had great service every time we've come. Tonight, our server, Taylor, was very patient and kind even though we ended up being there after they had closed. We appreciated his hospitality, as well as every other server we've had since we started dining here!\n",
      "Far off the strip comes a beautiful place at a movie strip mall. Rustic and industrial, it has a bar vibe, but safe for families with young kids. You got pizza, drinks, and beet salad - you have my attention. 1. The pizza that I ordered, The Settebello: Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The crust was toasty with a medium crust. The cheese was fantastic. (4.5 stars) 2. The Beet Salad - good portion, but I'll pass the next time. (3.0 stars) But the beet salad, the level of service (inattentive and flighty), and the cocktail I ordered (wrong twice)...lowers the rating of my experience. Would I go back? For the pizza, but I would sit in the bar stick with a beer. Free parking.\n",
      "One of the best pizzas in Vegas. Just like the Italian one. Very friendly and nice staff. Very good happy hour and every Monday you can eat a regular Margherita for just 5$! And try Zeppole with Nutella as dessert! To die for!!!\n",
      "Located inside the Village Square center, Settebello is divided into two sections, both of which are serving up delicious eats. On the right hand sand, you've got a standard dining area with booths and tables. On the left, you'll find additional seating including some high tops and a full bar. One of the coolest parts about the setup here is that everything is very open, so you'll be able to see the wood fire oven from just about anywhere you sit. The menu itself is somewhat small. Aside from about a dozen pizza options, there's only a few other choices of salads, antipasti's and a couple meat trays. You're not going to find any pastas or sandwiches here but they've also got a decent wine list, a few cocktails and a handful of dessert options. This was our first time here and were told the pizzas were personal size. However, at about 12\", it's a good size pie and for me, I'd only be able to finish the whole thing if I didn't eat anything else. As suggested by our waiter though, we ended up sharing a salad and pizza between the two of us. That was a perfect amount of food, while still having room for dessert. ;) For the salad, we decided on the Romana. I'm not normally a huge salad eater but I couldn't get enough of this. It comes loaded with arugula, artichokes and speck, then it's topped off with a good amount of goat cheese, pines nuts and dressing. The flavor was just amazing! It's salty, it's a bit sweet and the textures perfect. Everything on the plate was incredibly fresh as well. Just a great salad all around that I'd highly recommend. Moving on to the pizza, we ended up going with the Settebello to share. Want to talk about flavor? Talk about this pizza. It might seem like a lot going on when you look at all the ingredients but everything comes together so perfectly. The crushed tomato is great and their mozzarella is ridiculously tasty. And my new favorite pizza topping might just be pine nuts. Now, want to talk about crust? Yup, talk about this pizza. It's almost bread like in the center with a very soft, chewy texture but the outside is crispy and gets that awesome char from the wood fire grill. My one and only complaint about this pizza is the amount of toppings. There was a very small amount of sausage compared to the other ingredients and some slices even had no meat on them. Not a huge deal, but the could definitely be a bit less stingy with the meat. They're dessert worthy too! While a bit on the overly sweet side for my liking, the Bella Mela is definitely worth a try. The combination of apples, cinnamon, almonds and mascarpone is so good, you'll probably ended up wanting to eat the whole thing alone, even if you are full from dinner. So, when it comes to pizza, we all know there's no shortage of options here in Vegas. But if you want legit, Neapolitan pizza...Settebello is where it's at! Prices aren't bad and the service is excellent too. A solid 4 stars and a must try in my book!\n",
      "I am a BIG fan of the Settebello location down on Green Valley Pkwy. As this location on Sahara is closer to home, I gave it a try! Gotta say - the Green Valley location makes better pizza! The crust was much doughier at the Sahara location while GV's is crispy and light. My Emilia pizza had corn on it at GV and did not have ANY corn on it at Sahara (my favorite ingredient in that pizza!!!) Ambience and decor is nicer at this Sahara location with a more industrial chic look. GV's location is a little more of an italian restaurant feel. I love the patio at GV - wish Sahara's location had one too! Overall, I think the food is still good but it's worth the drive down to Henderson to their other location. I would recommend the two locations work on getting more consistent recipes between the two locations.\n",
      "This is purely a statement about the manager at end of the bar on your phone. Get info ur phone! 30 plus minutes just pokemon'ing away....\n",
      "Like Pomo in Scottsdale, this place is simply awesome. My family and I love napoletana style pizza. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could not like it. The crust is that perfect uneven crispiness on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. The tomato sauce on Settebello's pizza was particularly delicious and we loved the mozzarella di bufala on the pizza. We also loved the $27/bottle Banfi cabernet/san giovese bottle of wine. The atmosphere is fun and attractive. Our waitress was delightful and helpful. You can't go wrong here. It's delicious.\n",
      "I am the type of individual who loves pictures to be able to see what the food looks like but unless you look on yelp that's gonna be your best resource. The descriptions of all the pizzas sounded good so it was a little difficult to choose. However we asked the waitress what was the popular and she mentioned the Diavola and Settebello. The boyfriend and I shared the Diavola, and we ordered it extra crispy and asked for it to be a white pizza instead of red. My recommendation is if you're hungry ... don't share. One pizza is not enough for two (order your own ... plus you can try more options when you order two!) Diavlo has a spicy kick to it which I loved, I wish it was a little spicier. Extra crispy is the way to go. If you get it original the crust is crispy but when you get towards the middle you will have to use a knife and fork to eat it, or fold it in half and bite into it because it's soft in the middle. Our friends got both the Settebello, one got the original and the other got it as a white pizza. I definitely liked it as a white pizza. However I am a fan of white pizzas so it might be a little biased. With that being said, the waitress said any pizza can be a white pizza and you can add or take off anything to your liking. Saving the best for last ... the Bella Melo pizza for dessert was delicious. Super sweet with caramel and apples. Overall this place was a nice place for a group of friends to get together to share pizza and have good conversations.\n",
      "I've been meaning to try this place for a while and what better time than pi day, 3/14/16, to have a pizza pie :) We came around 8pm which was during happy hour but the space was pretty empty. I would give my dining experience 5 stars for service and 3.5 for food. We ordered strictly from the happy hour menu: We started with the arancini (friend risotto balls) and the artichoke crostini. I did not like the arancini. Whenever I see this on the menu, I typically order it. Settebello's version did not have enough flavor in the risotto. Instead, the predominant taste was that of the deep fried outside. However, I really LOVED the tomato sauce it was served with. It was super tasty and fresh. I liked the artichoke crostini much better than the arancini. It had good flavor; of course I think anything with goat cheese does. I think it could have used more balsamic reduction than just the garnish. Next we decided on the Dia Vola and the Vico pizzas. The Dia Vola was spicy, but almost so much so that I didn't really taste much else (I do have a pretty high tolerance for spice). It was still good though and I love the crust of Neapolitan style pizza in general; it was perfectly foldable. *Side note: I believe they are VPN certified which means they conform to standards that make this legit Neapolitan pizza. A VPN certification is rare and they are the only ones in Las Vegas that can boast of it.* I enjoyed the Vico pizza much more. We ordered this for my boyfriend because he loves white pizza but I enjoyed the flavors too as they all nicely complemented each other. Again, it was good but it wasn't anything amazing. Lastly, we ordered the house made crostata ricotta e Nutella for dessert. It was delicious! I wish it wasn't drizzled with Nutella because the flavor on its own was wonderful. It was just slightly sweet. Would definitely order this again. Overall, we had an enjoyable dinner and were able to order 5 dishes and a Peroni for just $30. Great happy hour prices! We left very full and we were super hungry to begin with because we had just come from the gym. Additionally, the service was excellent. Our server was Bethanie and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. Our hostess was also a doll. Thank you ladies for taking pride in your work and making our experience so enjoyable. I think the next time I visit Settebello will be at the Henderson location. Yelpers rave about that location so I purposely came to the Summerlin location first to give them a fair review. Additionally, I wouldn't order the same pizzas again as I wasn't wowed by either of them.\n",
      "I came here about a week ago with my baba because Archie's was booked full and the overall experience at this place was very blah. We came during the lunch rush and the place wasn't very busy. They're understaffed (3 people) and the 2 waiters and 1 waitress were dressed very inappropriately for work. In all honesty I thought they were customers themselves. When we walked in the host tried to sit us at a high table with high chairs even though my father walks with a cane... I was shocked that this boy couldn't use common sense. The waitress as very slow at getting us anything we needed and quite rude when we questioned her as to why she took 12 minutes to take our bill so she could run the card. We both got the lunch special. My father got the panzenella salad with the settebello pizza and I got the beet salad with the diavola pizza. Both salads were very underdressed and dry. The pizzas where also lacking in flavor, depth and the crust was overcooked and chewy. I won't be coming back here but if you want to try it by all means go ahead. Nothing ventured nothing gained!\n",
      "This is probably some of the best pizza in Las Vegas. If you are looking for New York-style, pan crust or Sicilian, then this place is not for you. You'll be getting the real-deal kind of pizza, as it is served in Naples. The insalata is simple and satisfying. I usually stick to the margherita pizza, as it never disappoints. My boyfriend loves the arancini as well. This location is quite larger than its Henderson counterpart, and the furniture and tables (including lighting and bar) are equal parts rustic and gorgeous. The only drawback to this location (as opposed to one in Henderson) is that they don't serve gelato. Other than that, it's not far from my house and I don't have to go to all the way to Henderson when I'm jonesin' for Settebello anymore.\n",
      "Been here three times, seems to be getting worse each time. I wish they could make a crispy pizza! The salads are under seasoned but not bad.\n",
      "One night while driving around Village Square and changing my mind from Rubio's, Jollibee, Yojie's and Buldogi's, I realized this restaurant was here. Since my obsession with Grimaldi's changed to my obsession with The Pizza Kitchen, I've been pretty pizza-ed out, but still wanted to try their Napoletana style pizza. We had just missed happy hour, but I'm glad we got to enjoy their regular menu first. Their beet and goat cheese salad was fresh and a very hearty portion size for two people. The crostini con crudo featured high quality meat and cheese, but I don't think I'd order in the future since the meat kept on getting stuck in my teeth. We decided on sharing the Settebello pizza which was everything I wanted a sausage pizza to be. I enjoyed their dough and thought they had the perfect amount of salt in it. Everyone should always save room for dessert here. From all the amazing choices, we decided on the crostada, which is a tart with ricotta, chocolate chips and Nutella. It's actually not too chocolatey and very well-balance. Our dedicated server was delightful and gave us amazing recommendations, and any staff that helped us along the way was very friendly. The only complaint I have would be that the lighting in the restaurant is a bit off and distracting - it made for some weird shadows over the tables and gave me a bit of a headache. Otherwise, no other qualms about this place and hope to be back here soon!\n",
      "Had dinner there tonight. The other yelp reviews are accurate. The flavor of the pizza is delicious the sauce and toppings. I enjoyed it but the crust is thin which I like. But it is soggy and doughy when u pick it up everything slides write off. My favorite thing was the insulate salad fresh green pine nuts parm cheese olives it's very tasty. They have this amazing non alcohol ginger beer and it is so yummy. I had a coast land blond on tap beer also great. I don't think I would go back very often for this pizza :( sadly the crust is too soggy. Great customer service!!!!!!! But about 8:30 they start to rush u out and gave us our check before we finished our pizza and my beer\n",
      "When someone who doesn't really like pizza LOVES this pizza joint, you know it's gotta be something special. Been here with friends several times now and the pizzas have always been consistently delicious. The wait can be a little slow but every pizza I've had has hit the spot. Standouts for me have included Margherita DOC, a pizza that's not listed online but contains pear, and a brisket pizza. Best part is to ask for the olive oil and their spicy oil to mop all the crust up with. And then dessert pizza. Imagine dessert pizza with cinnamon and marscapone and honey. I don't think I need to say more. :) This is definitely one of the places I have on my recommendation list for any friends who come to town.\n",
      "Nice servers and nice atmosphere, but pizza was not bad, but not that great. Salads were good, but they use arugula lettuce so it was bitter. It would not be my first choice to get pizza and drinks, but if someone else wanted to go or suggested it, I would go then. Just kinda so - so. I have only been once so far so maybe another pizza would be better. Not bad at all, just kinda average.\n",
      "Everyone in my family loves this place. I thought it was good but not great. They have thin crust pizza cooked in authentic pizza ovens. I'm more of a deep dish guy, but the pizza was still good. I also got their meatball appetizer and they were delicious. Next time I go back, I'm going to order extra to throw on my pizza.\n",
      "Slooow service at 1:30 with more employees than customers. The days old premade/frozen meatballs were still cold in the microwaved / oven reheated dish with a undersesoned tomato sauce & good quality melted cheese. Salad was bland & without seasoning or anyother veggies...a tasteless board of bacon wrapped without a hint of dressing & good goat cheese. Both pizzas were both burnt throughout the crust & spots underneath but also undercooked & doughy elsewhere. 60 bucks for this food is criminal & the waiter argues that the black isn't burnt. Wanted to cut off any piece of the black carcoal tasting portions & tell him to eat the friggen burnt charcoal ashy pizza & tell me with a straight face it's again isn't black & burnt. SMH....we will never return to this shameful place. I can & do produce much better food myself (so much for tying your place)...minus the extremely slow, ignorant & argumentative employee who is unaware of my years of quality food preparation experience. The waiter doesn't know his customer, but is well versed in excuses for customer disappointment. Your months long experience of slinging overpriced, tastless, undersesoned, burnt & undercooked food doesn't make you a food coneisuer nor a chef/cook. Here's a tip...if you can't get the oven temperatures & or the dough recipe right so as not to both burn & undercooked your pizza.... close it down. Likewise if you're charging premium prices don't serve friggen cold meatballs by reheating them in a microwave, so the cheese & sauce are super hot hot & the center of the meatballs are still ice cold. One more tip you can thank me for since your oven maybe your problem (which is a costly fix) if you failed to get it installed right in the first place....brush the crust with a butter or egg wash & it will not burn the dough & use cornmeal on the bottom (unless Ypu can get the temperature & recipe right). You're welcome & while your at it laminate the cheap, flimsy & strained cheap paper menu's....it's the first sign you're resturant is sub par... attempting to pass as an elite pizzeria. And don't microwave anything. Trash your microwave now & any cook/chef who uses it. It was embrassing to bring my family here...I hope your family experiences the same disappointing dinning experience next time you go out to eat at another restaurant. Karma is the word you should be reminded of in the event your experience is way below standard. Below standard & over priced is what you are serving the community. It's a joke what your resturant produces...regardless of the high prices you charge. Thanks neighbor!\n",
      "I have been patiently waiting for years for a west side location for this Henderson landmark. Over the top best. Josh our server could not have been more engaging, helpful and informative about the new location. Only negative is I am sure it will be hard to get in once everyone know they are there. I have a photo of the salads and pizza we had put cannot figure out how to post.\n",
      "The Henderson location has been my favorite pizza place since I came to town, but it was a sometime visit because of the distance from home. Sooo glad to have the new one on the west side. Pizza seemed underdone which I hope is just part of the breaking-in process. The physical restaurant is very attractive and should become a local hotspot. Viva Settebello!\n",
      "Had to try settobello after hearing it had come to summerlin. Pizza is very European .. Which I usually love. I felt like this pizza was almost undercooked in the middle. No real pastas on the menu either ..,sorry but If you want real pizza and pasta try dom demarcos down the street- it's amazing !\n",
      "I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but I'm getting tired of them changing things time and time again. We have been going there since it opened and first they stopped serving sangria Italiano. Sangria is a definite must have! Then they keep changing the Misto! It use to have a great roasted zucchini and Kalamata type olive's along with the selection of meats, then a changed to an awful green olives, now they have a awful fried eggplant and fried zucchini. Who wants more grease with the fats from the meat? The fresh selections were a much better choice! Service has been slipping a bit also..\n",
      "So delicious! Fresh salads with the best prosciutto and thin soft pizzas! Their variety of \"mule\" drinks during happy hour are a must!! Don't miss the Nutella dessert pizza. Amazing. The bar is a cool place to hang out too.\n",
      "Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good! Priced at $13.50 I had the \"Margherita DOC\" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!\n",
      "This is the second time my boyfriend and I have been here and needless to say they have not disappointed. Their food is amazing and they're always so kind. Tonight we took our friend from out of town here and, again, they did not disappoint. However, their Internet was down which meant they could not accept credit cards. After waiting a bit while (the manager?) was on the phone with their company trying to get it back up, the man came over to us and handed us a new bill, apologized for the inconvenience, and told us to have a good night. Confused, I looked at the bill and they completely compt our meal. I absolutely appreciate the gesture and working at a high end nail salon I understand when frustrations happen to where you comp a service.. I've been on that side and I understand the personal feeling of being upset that a customer would be annoyed with you for something out if your control. Needless to say, we absolutely love this place, will always pay for our meals even if they show their kindness in paying for the meal themselves, and will be a long time customer. You guys, as I've said, do not disappoint. Thank you so much for always a great experience.\n",
      "My coworkers and I come here during our lunch break probably once a week. I was off with my wife for New Years, and I took her here for lunch yesterday. She had never been to Settebello and I had always told her how good the pizza was. It didn't seem too crowded and we were greeted by the same server named Adam, I believe. He is always very friendly and even acknowledged that I was there with my wife and not my coworkers. It's very nice to feel remembered. I always get the margarita pizza, but my wife insisted we get a salad, too. She choose the insalada grande. I'm not much of a salad person, but it was very good. The food here is just so fresh tasting. Every time I have eaten here I can taste how fresh my pizza is, and in this case the salad, too. When we had finished Adam suggested dessert. I had never had any here and my wife loves chocolate, so Adam suggested the zeppoles. Simply amazing. I really wanted to write this review because I was nervous of disappointing my wife about the lunch place I had talked up so much. But, like always amazing food and spot on service.\n",
      "Hoy me despierto con el escándalo de algo que no sé que es lo que es, y cuando salgo para ver qué está pasando no es nada más que el jefe de manteniendo del condominio y muy amable le preguntó ( que pasó que van hacer ) y el señor de lo más grosero ( sin educación ) responde que va ser lo que tenga que hacer, personas así no deberían tener trabajos que los relacione con las personas.\n",
      "Do not rent there !!!!!!! Beware of these crooks.They will charge you for damages that dont exist!tThey don't notify you but they will say they did and then they turn it over to a collection agency and three months later you get a call saying you owe 800$.Before you move out make sure you do a pre move out inspection!\n",
      "On the outside, this place looks great! When you call, expect no answer. Not sure if the two numbers listed were both wrong, but could not get in touch. Makes me think the management is a bit short staffed, so what else could they be short on in providing to those who live there? If I can ever get a response, I may change this review.\n",
      "The staff are super nice (especially Perla :) ) Owner is great. You leave knowing that ALL issues have been covered with your eyes. They do a great job there & you can tell they really love helping people. My mom has hell stories with eye docs so thanks for being 1 of the good guys! Thanks!\n",
      "Had the opportunity to stop in to Lens Crafter yesterday. Have an older, but love them, pair of glasses that required a new nose guide and were out of shape. The lady on duty quickly asked how she could help and got me in and out inside of ten minutes. The glasses are like new. Fantastic customer service. Thank you!!!\n",
      "Went here to get an eye exam for new contact lenses. The eye doctor didn't like the Acuvue lenses I'd been wearing for the last ten years, and pushed me to try a different kind. They never felt comfortable, but she said they would gradually feel better. They never felt as good as my old ones, partially because she also didn't believe in using lenses especially for astigmatism, which I had always had before. Granted, I should have protested more, but the end result was that I paid $150 for an eye exam and got a prescription for contacts that I never used. It was a complete waste of money when I really didn't have any to spare. I don't know if she got a bigger kickback from the makers of the contacts she wanted me to have or what, but it was a terrible experience. Eventually, I did call and ask if they could write me the same prescription but for Acuvue lenses but was told that they couldn't do that without the doctor seeing how they were on my eyes. Ultimately, I've ended up using my last pack of 2-week acuvue disposables for a couple months for each set of lenses until I can afford another, more reputable, eye exam.\n",
      "I had never gotten an eye exam prior to this, but I went in due to constant headaches. Dr. Mallinger took the time to explain why & answered all my questions. I definitely didn't feel rushed and she was so sweet. The office is extremely clean and the staff members are nice! As I was finished with my glasses fitting, checking out, Dr. Mallinger came out and handed me her notes that she documented in regards to my visit. She thought i'd enjoy reading over them because i'm in nursing school. I absolutely appreciated that! I've referred a couple to them already. AND, my glasses came in way earlier than expected! Ill definitely be back.\n",
      "How is it that every time I go to Dr. Mallinger I end up having a great time? For something as simple as getting your eyes checked and picking out a pair of glasses, the staff makes it all the more better. Everyone is always in a great mood, even in the early hours of the morning, but that might be because their coffee machine is out of this world (I'm serious, you want a vanilla latte with actual pumps of vanilla and freshly steamed milk while picking out your new frames? You got it.) And it's not just the staff, Dr. Mallinger herself is a right joy. She is easy to get along with and makes sure you're comfortable during the exam while being patient and explaining what is it that she's doing. She even got some fancy new equipment we were admiring together today - fun stuff I promise. With their great collection of (sun)glasses, a wonderful staff, and delicious coffee, I just wish I had more of a reason to keep going back and saying hello to everyone.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this doctor!! She has helped me in so many ways. I don't like wearing contact lens so I wear glasses most of the time. But, she was patient with me and allowed me to try as many different lens as possible until I found the right brand. Now, I wear glasses during the week and then contacts, that are comfortable, on the weekends. I feel great in my contacts on the weekends and then during the week I get compliments about my glasses constantly. The staff was also great in helping me select frames that fit my style and look. In addition, I got prescription sunglasses that look great and people don't know they are prescription. I will use this doctor for the rest of my life and will continuously recommend her to all my friends and family. I highly recommend you use Dr. Mallinger as your family optometrist!!\n",
      "I love this place. Three members of my family use this office for our vision needs. Always friendly , know the system with insurance companies to minimize out of pocket expenses, good selection . Staff seem to be engaged and a constant , not too much turnover that I can see. Most importantly , they adjust / fix my little guys glasses regularly at no cost and a big smile.\n",
      "OMG!! If I could copy the review from Claudia I would. Dr Mallinger and her staff is all about customer service, having fun and getting top notch care!!! Tiffany, Jamie and can't leave out JOE!!! I can't remember the last time I had FUN at a Dr's office. I get a little paranoid about taking up so much time looking for glasses but Joe made sure that I'm getting the right glasses for my face and prescription. The only thing that makes me sad is I only have to visit once a year!! Look no further for Optometrists. This is the only place to go!!!!! Thank you Dr. Jennifer for making me feel so welcome and considering all my options for my prescription and my crafting!!!! Over and above the call of duty!!!\n",
      "Moving to Las Vegas was a huge transition for our family. My three children had many new adjustments, one being all new doctors. Mallinger Family Eyecare was highly recommended by a friend of mine. It was so nice to walk into such a friendly environment! The staff was truly kind to my children and made them feel extremely comfortable. They worked directly with my insurance company and made my visit fast (as many moms with young children know is VERY IMPORTANT). One fabulous doctor down (eye), now many more to find!\n",
      "What can I say!?..the kind and compassionate staff as well as the lovely Dr. Mallinger was beyond expectations for an eye exam. There is almost always a high expectation going into an optometrist's office-a new one at that. Mallinger Family Eye Care is supreme in the eyes(no pun intended) of us folks that require quality eyecare. I've had the please of having my entire exam conducted by Dr Mallinger. She is extremely knowledgeable and completely thorough in her work. 100% satisfied with my time spent with my new eye care family! Tiffany, office manager was beyond gracious to me and himself my request with professionalism and compassion. We need more citizens in this world who care above and beyond like her. Thank you again Tiffany and staff for all you do. You're the best!\n",
      "When my optometrist friend tells me that Dr. Mallinger is her doctor, I listen. I haven't had a bonafide eye exam since 2005 when I had Lasik (the best money I ever spent), but age has started to rear its ugly head. I'm starting to do that thing where I read a menu and have to hold it away from me--ugh. So, I finally made an appointment and Dr. Mallinger and staff did a thorough job of examining the peepers, complete with the puffs in the eye and the test where you click if you see tiny lights. I didn't have a designated driver so no eye dilation today, but I still have 20/20 vision, so no worries. I did end up ordering some \"readers\" for all the time I sit in front of the computer, but especially for reading menus--us Yelpers need to see what we're ordering.\n",
      "Their food is pretty good. We know it's a good place to eat if we always come back. We always order their fried rice and so far tried a couple of soups. The General tso's and sweet and sour chicken is good. Not a fan on their sio Mai...\n",
      "What a find! The food was delicious! We had the Ribeye Pho soup, with Peking Duck buns and Lettuce cups. So good! They serve wine and beer too.\n",
      "The issue has been resolved. I appreciate it, and will consider going back to try other items on the menu.\n",
      "I am experiencing a very upset stomach since eating here yesterday. ...this is quite difficult to do in that i am reputed to have a 'cast iron stomach'. Quote of the day..Do not eat the duck! I have cooked and eaten duck many times since my honey used to hunt them...however I've never eaten one that tasted like this..BAaaaaD..full of small and larger dangerous bones i really had to question what i was eating...horrible dead taste..ugh grosses me out thinking about it..honey and I both ordered it, he wouldn't eat his but I was starving and he hates to complain...learned my lesson! Complain and give back! The rice too which is hard to mess up was tasteless and gluelike, they gave us some type of cold tasteless greens. Were it not for the fact that they had all of those hot sauces on the table the meal would have been totally inedible..even for me...but geez the aftertaste..makes me want to vomit thinking about it even now, the honey reported the same bad aftertaste..I think i should report this to the health department. He did not get sick because he refused to eat it.\n",
      "I read in the local paper that Wu Hu is a new noodle shop at the Silverton. So me and my wife finally got an opportunity to go check it out. We both had the soup of the day, which was wonton soup; it looked beautiful when it came out the kitchen. The entrées we had were General Tso chicken with white rice & chow mein noodles with BBQ pork. As all the food looked amazing, it was a complete different case when eating it; the food was completely plain and it didn't have any the flavor. In my own personal opinion, I feel like the restaurant can use a few changes. When I first arrived, I thought this was a sit down restaurant, but it was not. You go to the counter to order then find a table to sit yourself. You also get your own utensils and fill up your own drink, etc. For the price and atmosphere this place gives off, I feel like a hostess and maybe some waiters can definitely make feel this place as a sit down restaurant. Honestly, to have spent this much money for basically a drive thru place is a bit much for nothing. Also, the appetizer/soup came out after our meals, which is a bit ridiculous if you ask me. The food came out way too fast; I mean the food was out by the time we sat down. I understand some people do not like to wait for their food, but I don't want to feel like I'm being rushed out. I feel like this can be a great place to eat. It has a great location, their atmosphere looks great, but I hope the next time I try it, the food will be better.\n",
      "4 stars for the Wonton with egg noodle soup, roasted duck and great service. I give 0 stars for their not so good \"ramen\". Wonton with Egg Noodle Soup ($12): The soup was good, lots of noodles, fresh Chinese veggies and a good amount of homemade wontons. I definitely liked this dish, it reminds me of what I ate growing up. However, $12 is pretty pricey. 1/2 Roasted Duck ($18): This is definitely a must get, lots of delicious flavor, not gamey, tender, juicy and huge portion. This dish can feed a party of 3. Tonkatsu Ramen ($10): My daughter wanted this so I said yes. The flavor was not good, the half boiled egg was gross and I'm glad that my daughter ate this and did not make me suffer and have me eat it. I will definitely go back and just order the Chinese dishes.\n",
      "A genuine Asian experience, the food is prepared when ordered, comes out quick. The food compares to what you find in china town, employees are very friendly, and the chef Chris is very welcoming and very knowledgeable and helpful when questioning the meals, he gives advice on which sauces to use with each meal.\n",
      "Panda Express meets PF Chang.. Located inside silverton Casino(open July 3,2015). You go to the register and order what you want, they give you a # and then find yourself a table (the table here are very high, I'm a shorty and I've a hard time getting up..hehe )and they'll bring the food to you..Made to order.. I've been here a few times and I really like the chinese food here. Affordable price and good amount of food. Small and contemporary decor.. Their starter are not worth ordering bc it's over price so little food.. My fav. By far are their Tom yum chicken, beef stew noodle and pork belly bun.\n",
      "Good food for a casino restaurant in the food court. Kids menu prices were a little steep, but the food was prepared well and fresh on the spot. The broccoli and beef was a little bland.\n",
      "No veggie options. The chef will make a veggie pad Thai, if you ask. Coupons for half off are available in the local Chinese newspaper. The half off coupon the casino offers will not work here.\n",
      "Was super excited to eat here as I was craving some pad thai... After waiting for over 10 minutes to place my order (when there was less than 5 ppl ahead of me), I finally ordered at 12:58pm... Waited along with at least five other people who placed their orders either right before or after me to get my food. After witnessing tables not getting the things they asked for, and not one to-go order being processed in about 20 minutes, I decided to give them a few more minutes and allow 30 minutes before I cancelled my order. At 1:35 I asked for my order to be cancelled and refunded. I will say, some of the food orders looked pretty decent that were being delivered to the tables, over 30 minutes for a to-go order of some noodles is excessive. No apology from the staff for having multiple guests waiting that long for what should have been an easy order.\n",
      "WuHu is located in the Silverton Casino food court. I was pleasantly surprised. Our group tried the Singapore Noodles, Orange Chicken, General Tao's Chicken, Chow Fun, HK Pan Fried Noodles, and Potstickers. Imagine Panda Express, but elevated. My favorites were the HK Pan Fried Noodles and Chow Fun. The gravy on the HK noodles was saucy and flavorful. The noodles were crisped just right. The Chow Fun was a tad oily, but the beef was tender. The chicken in the Orange Chicken and General Tao's Chicken dishes were slightly dry, but thankfully the orange peel sauce (Orange Chicken) and the spicy house sauce (General Tao's) helped tame the dry texture. The Potstickers were plump and airy filled with an ample amount of ground pork and shrimp. Service exceeded expectations at this fast-casual restaurant. Someone checked in with us every 10 minutes or so. I would eat here again if I ever come back to Silverton. Check it out if you're in the area.\n",
      "WoW...just bad and overpriced...they saved themselves a 1 because Asian is my comfort food and I haven't vomited yet . Pho was bland...duck was old and reheated...kung pao was bland...the rice was old and soggy as was the noodles in the Pho. The duck bao was amazingly good and I feel very tricked. Ok...I live walking distance and would not let a limo drop me off for a comped meal. Just plain Ew...\n",
      "I walked in expecting a big place. Turns out to be a small spot for fast food . The menu is small and prices are what you expect for a restaurant in a Hotel. The kitchen is busy and have the aroma of Chinese spices cooking. And overall not a bad place to eat . However I find the same quality outside of the Silverton at less expensive price. So I give a 3 .\n",
      "this place is inside the Silverton Casino, try the wonton noodle soup, beef chow fun, and veg. egg roll..all are good stuff, you can see the chef cooking stuff right there, it is like a fast food place, you order and pay first, then they will bring the stuff to you\n",
      "Came through here on a quiet Sunday prior to seeing a movie. Was expecting a normal restaurant but came to find out it was semi fast casual. Menu was easy to read and line moved fairly quickly. Food was cooked to order and cooks were relaxed like they had done this a million times. We ordered the General Tso's, Cashew Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, and Beef Chow Fun. Every dish was so fresh. The best part was the sauces. No thick consistency, like many places here have by adding too much corn starch. Everything was great. Almost gave it 4 stars solely based on the price point (but the food overcame). For fast casual, I feel like it should be $9-11 as opposed to $10-15 a meal, even though it's in a casino.\n",
      "Love the fried rice and the braised beef! Very fast service. The lettuce wraps are amazing! Definitely will be back to try other dishes!\n",
      "Good for a quick Asian food fix. Soups are a bit bland but the noodle dishes are very good. Like the flat rice noodle and the HK fried noodles as well. I'll be back.\n",
      "The Peking Duck stem buns were yummy but beware of bones. The shrimp chow mein was yummy with a little char from the wok but a little oily. My 7 yr. old loved the won ton soup.\n",
      "So thrilled to have authentic Asian cuisine near my house now! The room is so modern and the music playlist is awesome. I love the variety of Asian food available. They make handmade potstickers and broth. Great for vegetarians too!\n",
      "Had the Chicken Noodles (chow mien). Really good and not too salty. Wife had PK noodles with Pork. She liked it and was hot the entire time she ate it. I'd come back for sure.\n",
      "This place advertises itself as a Noodle House. Because it was 108 degrees outside, I didn't feel like eating hot noodles and/or soup. I ordered the BBQ Combination. For an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. The quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. It was dry and tough. As compared to Chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. But compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate. Remember this review is based on the BBQ offerings not the noodles. I assume they should be better. I do have a concern over the layout. There are to many tables that are too tightly packed. One has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. They are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners. Only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. Unfortunately, it's located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. The path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. I saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. Luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool. Strangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. I would say it was the most frequently asked question I overheard. There is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. But with the slick flooring and lack of any anti-slip matting. It is literally an accident waiting to happen. In the half hour I've been here I saw one of the employees or owners, Linda, almost do a face plant. I'm looking forward to trying the noodles in this place the next time I'm trapped at Silverton. But nothing I've seen induces me to give up my usual noodle spots, Mr. Noodle or Thai Style Noodle House.\n",
      "I'm gonna have to go with 3 stars. I asked for Kung Pao chicken extra spicy (I like to sweat when I eat) and chicken fried rice. The fried rice was soggy with grease and ok flavor. The King Pao was more like teriyaki than spicy and once again just ok. I am going back to try the Pho as the peeps next to us ha fit and it looked good.\n",
      "Waited 18 minutes for shrimp fried rice. The menu says green onions, eggs, and shrimp. No green onions and its full of peas and carrots...yuck. I ordered cause they weren't listed as part of the dish. The shrimp is a little too mushy for my taste and the fried rice has NO flavor at all...like plain white rice. Never again.\n",
      "My wife and I have walked past this restaurant in the Silverton Casino many a time! We looked at the menu but thought it would be very expensive to make a complete meal ( looked like ala carte). But, this time armed with a food credit...we decided to give it a go! And let me tell you...Wu Hu is Yahoo! It was delicious...and filling! We ordered the Mongolian Beef and the Sweet and Sour chicken. Both meals filled the plates to the rim! And we had the best rice to boot. All for the cost of just a few $'s more than Panda. The flavor so we're out of this world. The Mongolian had a nice bit of spice! The chicken was solid chunks of white meat with a thin blanket of breading. Just wonderful. And, we stared at the dishes being brought out by the staff for other diners...everything looked amazing. Going to have to try the chicken Pad Thai next time....And believe me There Will Be a Next Time! Yum!\n",
      "Salt and pepper pork, sweet and sour pork and noodle soup were well done. The spring rolls are excellent. The downside is it is not even close to being wheelchair accessible or ADA compliant. Code enforcement severely lacking. Eating there again on 8/18 and they were busy and no one to bus tables. No less than 9 tables were full of dirty dishes for over 30 minutes. We stacked them for them but still not removed for some time. This was only done when we insisted after our food order was delivered and placed among the dirty dishes. Then 15 minutes later we had to chase them down to get the last 2/3 or our order.\n",
      "The food was ok not great. It was just a pre-opening that the casino. The food had light tastes to them and the noodle was very oily. I like the Shu-Mai only. The rest that they served were Pad Thai which was lacking the peanuts, the fried rice was not very tasty, stirred beef with veggies was ok but too sweet, and the pork dumplings were pretty good. Overall the service was very good but needs to work on the food. The price was decent. It was under $15 per dish. I mean it would not be a restaurant I would like go back to. You can get better Asian food outside the casino. The place was a little small and it was kind of odd having the tables like a bar and hard to get around, my mom said it was like a fast food restaurant. Not good for kids because they can get hurt walking under the tables. Not enough room for parties.\n",
      "Went to the Silverton Casino to see their aquarium and found Wu Hu Noodle nestled in their food court. We were not very hungry so we just got some shu mai and lettuce wraps. They were great. All the food other patrons were eating looked delicious and everyone seemed to be enjoying it. Will have to go back when we have a bigger appetite.\n",
      "The food is cheap and delicious. The only problem is that they are understaffed. Maybe it's a function of being so busy. They always have a line from opening to close. Popular restaurant. They also use real plates and silverware, which is a plus.\n",
      "We have eaten here 4 times and every time it's easily a 40 minute wait. The food is excellent. It's worth waiting for. The problem is it's not wheelchair accessible. My husband is unable to sit at the high tables. They should mark the only low table with handicap emblems. Please check into making it handicap accessible!\n",
      "Some really good food here - roast duck, beef chow fun, and pad thai (yes, they have a few items that fit under the asian umbrella). You don't often expect a hanging roast duck in a casino restaurant, but they had them here. I wish I had ordered some BBQ pork as well. It is not super cheap, but what you would expect from any restaurant in a casino. Order at the counter and they'll bring you the food. Really solid food.\n",
      "Ordered the BBQ combination and got cold rice that was hard and tasted like it was from the bottom of the rice cooker , was so hungry I didn't complain but made a review instead\n",
      "I had the pleasure of attending the YEE here recently. I enjoyed the food and made plans then to come back. I brought the wife along as like me she lives Asian cuisine. We started out with the Siu Mai and Szechuan Dumplings. The Siu Mai were tasty and seemed much larger than other places. The dumplings were perfect and not too spicy. For the main course we had the Pad Thai, Mongolian Beef and Wuhu Beef Fried Rice. The Pad Thai was the least favorite thing we ordered. The noodles were stuck together and it had a sour taste. The Beef Fried Rice was very good. Lots of great tasting beef paired with the tasty fried rice. The Mongolian Beef was well prepared with tensor beef and veggies. The sauce was a great compliment to the delicious dish. We had some leftovers and added a few item for our daughter. Got her the Tonkotsu Ramen, Walnut Shrimp and Pot Stickers. She loved the Walnut Shrimp and Pit Stickers. The Ramen was very good also as I gave it a try. She didn't share the shrimp or pot stickers! Being in a casino is kind of a problem for me as I don't care for the smoke walk to get to a restaurant. The good thing is the Silverton is not that bad compared to many casinos. The prices at Wuhu are very good and what you get will please your Asian food cravings. They have a variety of food from all over Asia. It is well prepared with fresh ingredients. This is not a high end place but you get good food and it comes to your table pretty fast. If I am in the area I will definitely come back.\n",
      "I have been to WuHu Noodle four times for lunch and each time has been nothing but satisfactory! Each dish is made to order, authentic and full of flavor. You can tell that the chefs have a real passion and love for cooking. Every dish from their pot stickers to Singapore Noodles have been to die for! They even offer carry-out which is AMAZING!\n",
      "Did not intend to dine here but our favorite Mexican restaurant was closed :-(. So glad we ended up here!Enjoyed their Pad Thai dish.. Sooo yummy! Good sized portion-- not too big, and but just enough. Loved the ambiance, cleanliness, quick service, and the server was nice and friendly. Will definitely come back.\n",
      "I had their General Tso Chicken and it was best I've had anywhere. Friendly and prompt service makes this place a great eat .\n",
      "Not impressed at all.. In fact wish we didn't choose this one. Crab Ragoon - it had so much curry in it, that's all you could taste. The Mongolian Beef - flavor was there, but the beef was chewy! All in all - yuck!\n",
      "I love this place now I dont have to go to China town anymore, fresh and quality authentic Chinese food in a very clean place . I come here about twice a week. Love it.\n",
      "After having the pleasure of eating here during a Yelp Elite event, it was only a matter of time before I would find myself enjoying the food once again. Check out the Yelp Elite Vegas page for even more reviews of this cool spot inside the Silverton Casino. The location gets pretty packed and seating is first come first serve. Order right up front at the cashier and wait til they bring out your food. This time we ordered their version of Pad Thai, a Wonton Noodle Soup, Gyoza, and Pork Belly Steamed Buns. My wife's chicken pad thai was delicious to me albeit a bit too spicy for my wife's liking. As far as I know, there is no variation of spicy level to choose from but I suppose asking for a milder or non-spicier version would be suggested next time. We tried to ask for some peanut sauce to drizzle over the pad thai but they did not have any. (Alas, this is Chinese and not a Thai restaurant) Their wonton noodle soup was good but could use a little more salt to flavor the broth. The wonton dumplings were of good quality filled with decent amount of stuffing and the thin noodles were plentiful. The gyoza was standard but the smoky hot chili oil elevates it. You also have some of the best hot mustard made here as well as red chili sauce. The pork belly steamed buns are a must for me. Three ample sized slow-cooked pieces of pork belly bursting with flavor hugged by a pillow of soft chewy goodness in the steamed bun. They hit this dish way out of the park. Next time you make your way to Silverton Casino, stop by here for a pretty delicious meal! I'll also recommend the duck. Had that during the Y.E.E. and it was excellent. Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 3/100\n",
      "Can you say fast food restaurant style? Geez, tables open but they don't have wait service other than after you stand in an always long line to order. Now for the food....if you are in search of ramen as I was...only 1 style to choose from. Tonkatsu ramen how can you go wrong. Very large slices of pork, lots of ramen. It's worth $ 10.00. Warms the tummy. WuHu fried rice, pork good too. Big chunks of pork, peas, carrots,onions. A $12.00 plats two could easily share. Oily though. Both dishes have that fast food oil taste to it. Shameful. Not a fan of fast food, I want to enjoy my warm soup but alas. Sitting next to a coughing, nose blowing woman is not pleasant either!\n",
      "The food was very good and very fast. Only gave 4 because nobody was able to smile, or even really make me feel like we were welcome. But I guess it's a bit much having to take the orders and then having to deliver food to tables and also having to clean the tables. There were only two to do those tasks. I did notice that hat the Servers/Counter Attendants made no guest wait in line. We ordered the Curried Crab Wonton, Chicken Lettuce Cups, Pad Thai and Cashew Chicken. All being said, we would be back.\n",
      "The food is delicious !! The Staff is very friendly !! I'm eating here all the time. The pot stickers are hand made the curry crab puffs have so much flavor! The Singapore noodles are my favorite!!\n",
      "Love the new addition to the Silverton! Food is delicious. Haven't tasted anything I didn't like.\n",
      "Located in the Silverton Casino- I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles for $3 more. It was more than big enough for two people, but I polished it off like a savage. I may have to run over to the Bass Pro Shop nearby and buy a bigger pair of shorts. Food was fast, delish and reasonably priced. I will definitely come again!\n",
      "Very disappointed got there to order at 8:48pm they were still cooking and place is suppose to be open til 9pm. Yet they refused to take my order and another person walked up and refused them too. You have set hours so why not keep them I could understand if nobody was cooking still but your chefs were still cooking.\n",
      "Solid food each time I've been. Not quite the selection and flavour of say Noodle Exchange at Gold Coast but good for lunch. Not many seats so many folks get theirs to go.\n",
      "Pretty good! Had the duck and rice. Best duck I've had in Vegas so far. Also had the duck bao buns DELISH! Love to see Chinese people cooking Chinese food lol\n",
      "We went here this week kind of our last hurrah as we don't plan on staying or gambling at this casino any more (read our review on the casino). We eat Chinese quite often and really love it. The food here was outstanding! We had the Pad Thai and WuHu fried rice, both were perfect. We often eat in china town in Vegas and the food there for the most part is very good, but this was better and at a casino! The Resturant is very open to the casino, and yes the chairs are high and a bit tight to get in and out of but overall it was fine when the food came out. If your wanting Chinese, give WuHu a chance, you. Won't be sorry!\n",
      "finally tried Wuhu Noodle at Silverton....loved it! I will certainly be back to try more of their extensive menu offerings! Pork Belly Steamed Buns were different than what I was expecting - more like Bahn Mi - so delish!! the pork belly was perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside - 3 to a serving for $10 - listed as an appetizer but certainly enough for a meal if you don't want to share. Pad Thai was perfectly balanced with thin noodles and a wonderful sweet spicy sauce - again a fairly large portion. I took away one star for their seating - all high-boy tables and there are too many squeezed into the space - so it makes it a bit claustrophobic and inconvenient for the short/elderly/movement impaired. There is only one utensil station tucked into a corner - I might suggest a second station, perhaps by the drink station. Service was quick and unobtrusive. I will be back!!!\n",
      "Always a kind man at the register. Cleanliness is wellllll so so. Always out of silverware. I have never had a bad food item here. We come often due to it being in the sliverton and the comped meals. The kids size is big enough for an adult and regular is always enough for 2! I always take left overs due to the enormous size\n",
      "There are few restaurants that remind you of a beloved restaurant that you probably aren't remembering accurately. This place turns out an amazing product, its fast and cheap. It reminds me of little holes in the wall in Irvine and Monterey Park in college. The freshness of the wonton soup and the broth is so good. Yum. The wontons are phenomenal as are the bao.\n",
      "Yummy Chinese eats!! I ate here twice on my recent trip to the area and loved the food. This is located inside the *Silverton Casino* next to Starbucks and the food is fresh and made to order. What I ordered: -Salt and Pepper Tofu.. plentiful -Honey Walnut Shrimp.. scrumptious -WUHU Fried Rice.. yum! -Mandarin Noodles.. mMmmM -Salt and Pepper Pork Chop.. pretty good -Half Soy Braised Chicken..delish The food was well portioned with good pricing. Each item I tried did not disappoint as it was savory and hit the spot. They have three sauces for dipping at the table. The service is pretty good and it's a casual restaurant where you pay up front with the cashier, seat yourself, and they deliver your food. I dined in here and also did take out here.. both times were tasty and I would give this place 4 Stars.~\n",
      "It's so amazing some restaurant just gets it and knows what it takes. We had the typical Chinese, Thai and soups and they were all delicious. Service was very good not to mention the dishes (besides the roast duck) were made to order and came rather very quickly! Probably will try take out next time and enjoy this in the office or home. Thanks to WuHu for an excellent dining experience!\n",
      "This place is always busy when I'm at the Silverton, so that tells you something. I had the Oriental fried rice this time, and it was delicious! A real tasty dish and I could tell they take seasoning very seriously. This fried rice is chock full of meat- a sweeter sausage which was surprisingly yummy, and shrimp. Worthy of many a repeat visit! The wait for takeout was pretty long, around 20 minutes. The decor is similar to P.F. Chang's, slightly upscale. The Silverton recently added WuHu to it's free meal restaurants list for casino promos and at first I was excited! Not so much after finding out it was a 45 minute wait on a weeknight! It's a small place so I doubt this will change. I'm hopeful that since they are new to the promo restaurants list, perhaps some speedier woking and rolling is in their future! It would be a shame because I get quite a few chances to utilize the meal promo deals. One remedy is to order way before you're ready to leave the casino!\n",
      "Worst experience of Vegas we Order our food some of it came our Kung pao chicken didn't we tried getting our money back they just cancelled the order not the transaction one of the cooks is the one that could do it he just scream \"not now too busy\" food was flavor less too expensive for the taste. We will never be coming back to this place. One star cause you can't post without stars!!\n",
      "Excellent food and great service. Place was nice and clean. The older gentleman at the register was super nice and had great recommendations. Pork belly buns - great! Seasoned perfectly not bland and the pork belly was nice and tender. Moist not dry. Duck Noodle Soup - very good! The duck was delicious and super plumped. They give you a good portion of duck with your noodles too. The noodles is not the typical thin egg noodle but the thicker egg noodles more like chow mein but still very good. Broth was seasoned nicely tho I'm a saltier eater so I did add a little more soy sauce and hot chili oil Wonton - Ok. Meat was a little bland. Not the typical small wontons I like that usually goes with wonton noodle soup General Tso's Chicken - Amazing!! Absolutely loved the light crispy batter on the chicken. The sauce was good too not the typical general tsos sauce tho I think bc it had more of the soy sauce touch to it\n",
      "Orders are taken at the counter in this small restaurant, but all the food is freshly prepared. We had coupons from the American Casino Guide for free appetizers so we started with salt and pepper shrimp and crab rangoon. The shrimp should have been crispier and the rangoons should have had more crab flavor, but who can argue with the price? For entrees my wife and I shared Singapore noodles and eggplant with ground pork which were measurably better. This was way too much food so we departed with doggy bags in hand.\n",
      "Slow service and the food taste like it came from their buffet. Better off going to Panda Express, lol\n",
      "THIS PLACE! I have been here a dozen times, and the food here is always awesome! Hub and I tend to order the same thing, General Tso chicken and a side order of Edamame/garlic chili style. We order our Tso Hot...12/15 and they just nail it. The chicken is so fresh and lightly breaded...it is my favorite Tso in town... Heck... In any town! I hope this never goes away!\n",
      "Came back three days later about 8 pm and was told it would be a 45 minute wait for some items. We ordered and sat down and it was as they warned but it worked out very well. They appetizer came first - pork belly steamed buns - and they were even better this time. Next came the stir fried dishes and last which was my favorite was the HK pan fried noodles. My point is that they followed the Chinese tradition of cooking everything fresh - no par boiled veggies or meat to speed up the prep time! The noodles were done just right - a little crispy yet softened by the HK sauce. The pea pods were sweet and crunchy! I ordered shrimp with it and it was just right - almost tiger shrimp size and fresh! We ordered the Peking duck steamed buns but they were out so we ended up settling for the pork belly buns. Even better than the first time - just the right amount of hoisin sauce and when I added chili sauce as a kick - awesome! Will be back for sure!\n",
      "The management here is really good at taking care of their customers I will definitely be coming back here again the food is absolutely terrible I feel like this restaurant should be all over Las Vegas\n",
      "Good, fresh and flavorful!! I ordered shrimp fried rice, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour shrimp and Singapore noodles. It was all very good. My only complaint is that my food wasn't piping hot. I will definitely be back!\n",
      "This is a food court establishment inside a casino, and the food is merely above Panda Express level. I was very disappointed at the menu. The roasted duck was over roasted.\n",
      "I ordered the pho and the broth was extremely bland, and the food took 40 minutes to come out. The one good thing was the pork belly buns.\n",
      "I have a hard time finding the most perfect Tom Yum in the states, so I stopped ordering it after all the failed attempts... UNTIL.... I saw it offered here on the menu. I hesitated but i went all in. I ordered the Tom Yum and it wasn't too bad. The lemongrass flavoring was perfect! I could have used a few more shrimps-- I guess shrimp is expensive and so they cut corners on cost here--- ALSO-- instead of egg noodle, be sure to ask for RICE noodle. I got a bowl of thick egg noodles, which made my soup broth disappear. I prefer rice noodles with my Tom Yum. I gave this place a 3 star only because I enjoyed the broth more so than I have ever, since coming back from Bangkok. I'm so picky about my Tom Yum... The service at Wuhu Noodle is always so friendly and efficient!!! I would recommend their pad Thai -- highest level of spicy possible. I love spicy. If it isn't spicy then it's not worth eating.\n",
      "This is an interesting concept in a modern, attractive space. Absolutely everything we tried was ultra fresh and visually stunning. The spicing levels seemed a bit light-handed though, so if you like spice, be sure to let them know. Don't miss the curried crab wontons-they are a revelation!\n",
      "This place has great food. I tried the Japanese ramen, Singapore noodle and chow mien. Food is authentic. And service is fast. I would highly recommend this place.\n",
      "Food is amazing! Looks are kind of deceiving when you first walk up to the restaurant but it all taste like authentic food (not like fast-food). Staff is accommodating and friendly and very helpful. Would highly recommend this yummy yummy place!\n",
      "Having been impressed with management and the chef at the Newbie event, I returned to the fast casual restaurant in the Silverton to have some dishes again and to try some new ones. We weren't disappointed and we were satisfied with everything. There was no wait to be seated with plenty of high top tables available when we arrived on a Saturday night. After ordering at the counter and pouring our drinks at the fountain, our food was delivered to our table after a short 5 minute wait. The employees were helpful at the counter and at food delivery. Our order included Wuhu noodle soup with beef, HK wonton noodle soup, pot stickers, siu mai, pork belly steamed buns, Wuhu fried rice with chicken, and broccoli and beef. Originally, my wife wanted the beef noodle soup, but we did a swap and she took the wonton soup once she tasted handmade shrimp and pork wontons. The broth was also delicious with mushrooms, scallions, and other greens. My favorite for the night were the pork belly steamed buns. The soft, sweet bao, salty pork belly, and acidic pickled daikon, carrots, and micro greens together was a great couple of bites. One of their signature dishes is the roasted duck which they keep on display inside the roaster and is something I'll keep in mind to order on a future visit. The menu at Wuhu is varied covering a nice chunk of the Asian spectrum of food with prices that are reasonable. And although I wasn't Woo-hooing across the casino, Wuhu is a solid option if your fixing for some noodles and other Asian dishes.\n",
      "Very clean restaurant, I was impressed! customer service was good. I thought the portion size was going to be small but my eyes were bigger than my stomach! LOL\n",
      "Came here for the tasting private event tonight. They served me potstickers which was just about as good as any other potstickers I've had. Crab dungeoness filled with curry, which was really different. Then the Beef stew noodle - lack of flavor but I added soy sauce so it made it better. Then the Bbq pork fried rice which was pretty good. Then the Stir fry beef was good as well, the beef was tender. Then the Pad Thai, which can be more flavorful but for a Chinese place, was kind of an off dish. The tasting was very fulfilling, medium sized portions. Seating, I'm not sure how much I liked the high chairs, difficult to scoot into the table.\n",
      "Wok style cooking ! Fast, hot, delicious ! Many food selections ! Been there so many times !\n",
      "I came here with my whole family and my boyfriend's family. The biggest table we can get was for 8 people, so we had to sit separately, no big deal though. You order from the counter and they bring the food to your table when it's ready; it was pretty quick! This small restaurant has a nice ambience with a contemporary design. The prices are very reasonable with the big servings and deliciousness of the food! Craving for noodles but just can't decide what you want? This restaurant is perfect for you! They have a huge variety of noodles, from pho to pad thai to ramen!\n",
      "I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family. The food is very authentic and delicious. I haven't tried anything like it before. The service is great. Just be patient, excellence takes time. Food comes out quick but not too fast. So don't expect something fast like Panda Express. Anyway just go and check it out yourself and be your own critic.\n",
      "Good simple and fresh!!! Everything comes straight from the Wok to your table. I like everything I have tried\n",
      "Great beer selection, above average cocktails, good atmosphere, but the food could use some work. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately the moules frites they served were among the worst I've ever had and this is not a dish you can mess up easily. But in this case it was decent mussels and OK fries drowned in an awful lemon soup that had enough wine in it to impart an odd alcoholic flavor. What's worse is the fries and bread arrived in this soup rendering them a bit soggy. But there's hope! The beer and drinks are above average for Madison so as long as your primary motivation is to drink your dinner you're in luck. Bartenders and staff are also excellent.\n",
      "I love Cooper's - the food, the staff, the owner - but i have two peoblems with it. 1. The menu is very good but never changes. I work practically next door to the place but i would visit now often if they would change the menu occasionally. I doubt there had been more than a couple of changes in the last 4 years. 2. The noise. Hard walks and floors and a crowded room make it impossible to be heard on a Friday or Saturday night. P.S. Really great fries!\n",
      "The food/beer(huge list)/staff are always good. Would recommend the Chicken Curry. When I got it I was wondering where the fries were that came with it. They were under the chicken, vegetables and curry sauce. Almost like a poutine. Came with a large portion of chicken. Have never sat inside. It looks small and table look close together. We'll see when it comes winter time for an update.\n",
      "Excellent lunch and great place for beer. Ask to sit in the nook...it is a private booth that is a tribute to when women couldn't drink in bars. Seriously, it cool...and the bartender servers you through a sliding wooden window just off the bar, it's a hoot.\n",
      "My daughter and I were looking for a place for a snack and a late night drink on my recent visit to Madison. As we walked around the Capitol we struggled to find a place that wasn't so crowded and loud that we couldn't converse, but one that still have some energy and atmosphere. Then we happened upon Coopers. Full, but we were able to get a table. We had a fantastic waiter who made sure we had just what we wanted. Pretzel appetizer was exceptional and the drink selections perfect. We'll be back!\n",
      "the soup is still amazing, the fish and chips are still amazing, and we also tried the pretzel sticks which were VERY good as well - more bready than pretzely tasting, but still very yummy. i had the venetian manicotti which was good but reminded me of something SO familiar that i couldn't place, that i was more frustrated than anything with it.. ha.\n",
      "This place was pleasantly surprising. The fries and the aioli really stick out in my mind because they were THAT good. Order them. I ate the fish sandwich (I was there on Friday), and it was delicious but pretty impossible to eat as a sandwich. Just give me the fish on the plate! If you insist on the bread, give me a roll or three and I'll be happy. I wasn't really upset about anything, but I did find it mildly hilarious that I had to strategize (repeatedly) about each course of action I took before a bite. The beer selection is decent, though other places have it better. The atmosphere is nice. I sat at the bar, and while the bartender was good at his job, he came out on the ass end of my opinion when the back of house screwed him with REALLY slow service. It was lunchtime, but it wasn't so busy so as to justify 15 minutes passing (along with a pint of beer) before fries arrived. I'm generally laid back about things, but I'm honest when I write these things and it sucked having to wait so long for the fries. I don't really blame the bartender either, though he seemed oblivious that we had waited that long until a minute before they came out. He gave us the, \"your fries will be right up\" line, which did not resonate well with me at the time and I remember saying something to my girlfriend that was less-than-friendly but pretty damn funny at the same time. It was my coping mechanism. So, there you have it. Great fries, impossible sandwich, annoyingly slow service. I'll admit that things may improve the next time I go there. I'm a big fan of probability and the place seems like one that I want to go back to. I wasn't bowled over though.\n",
      "The steak frites looked beautiful but was so tough I didn't even bother finishing it. Me leaving asteak unfinished? That's unheard of.\n",
      "Still good pub food. I recently tried the fish fry.. mmm mmm mmm. I LIKE IT~! nice fresh fish, but really the batter was kinda thick and flimsy.. at least the flavor was there. The stuffed grilled cheese was really good too. AND POUTINE! I don't understand why it is so rare in Madison to get Poutine. The gravy sauce and melted cheese on fries? mmm mmm so goooooddd! It's still crowded and packed, but the wait has improved for food to be served after ordering! Good job, Cooper's crew!\n",
      "What a great surprise Cooper's was the other day! I was expecting a bar but it was so much more...To put it bluntly, this was some of the simplest, best tasting fare I have ever had at a tavern. In fact, even if it were not a tavern, I would go back for the food. The tomato-roasted red pepper soup was so stunningly good, I wish I had the recipe because I'm now craving it constantly. I then had the veggie sandwich. Now, I've had a veggie sandwich many, many times at many different eating establishments and believe me when I say that there are as many interpretations of this idea as there are eating establishments. This one was DELICIOUS. I have no idea what they did to it to make it taste so good but literally every component sung with flavor, including the nicely toasted Madison Sourdough bread. There was portobella mushroom, peppers, feta and zucchini and it was accompanied by a fairly large helping of mixed greens which were dressed (perhaps a bit too heavily) with a kind of Dijon topping that was also extremely tasty. My only complaint was that it was too creamy for me. Aside from the food, Cooper's has an extensive beer list and a very attractive interior comprised of blonde wood tables and floors and a large picture window looking out onto the capitol. We went two days after Christmas and they were doing a very brisk lunch business so I can only imagine what it must be like on a regular workday. I'll definitely be back to try more!\n",
      "One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!\n",
      "Dear Cooper, I had higher hopes for you after viewing your menu online. I had higher hopes for you after walking into your space, obviously channeling what you thought was a gastropub but turned out to be just another pub with flavorless food. Why, Madison, why are you so afraid of flavor?! Is that why the Jameson I ordered was so huge? (Thank you!) Is that why your beer list is so extensive and diverse? (Thank you again.) Because you expect your patrons to get well elixed before the food arrives? Let me tell you, the flavors of the food does NOT hold up to the flavors of your drinks. I suppose I should have known not to order a Italian dish (polenta) off of a mostly Irish menu. It was not only bland, it was very hot. But not out of the pan hot, out from under the heat lamp / out of the microwave hot. I see you Cooper's, and it ain't nearly as hot as your food. My friend had the mac and cheese with pork belly on top. The mac and cheese, aside from the topper, was dull. So so dull. Not even as flavorfull as Annie's out of the box. Find the salt, it's on a shelf, about head high. And oh my lord this pork belly was awful tasting, when it wasn't chewy and tasteless. Neither dish was 1/2 finished when we were finished. Drinks, people. This place is good for drinks and atmosphere and frites.\n",
      "Good coctail. Service was awesome. I had the polenta. Pretty good. I'm not sure how the polenta was cooked... little mealy. I would've preferred it be pan fried or something. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich. He said it was good, especially the bacon aioli.\n",
      "We were in Madison to visit my daughter and enjoyed her recommendations on where to go. We had some sliders (called Wee Burgers) for appetizers. Beers were good. My bf enjoyed chicken breast soaked in beer brine, encrusted in pretzel with cream mustard sauce, with brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. My daughter enjoyed the Mussels. I ordered the Boston Wedge Salad with chicken which was very fresh and cool. I loved the pumpkin seeds and pickled grapes.. A really great touch. BF had the chocolate tart with sea salt and bourbon glaze. We had a lovely evening watching people on the sidewalk, across from the Capitol and just relaxing together on the last night of our visit. The staff were friendly and informative and on the ball. A perfect spot to represent Madison's great cafe atmosphere in summer.\n",
      "Great atmosphere and fantastic selection of craft beers!\n",
      "Service was \"eh\" here. First time here and probably won't be going back anytime soon. We decided to order dessert here and it wasn't the best. Didn't finish it and that's all I have to say about that.\n",
      "Went to Cooper's Tavern on a Saturday night around 9 PM with friends. I guess it could have been the time of night but a couple of the items we wanted to order were out for the evening. Boo. We ended up ordering the poutine and the pretzel with cheese to start. The pretzel was good but the poutine was disappointing. Not nearly enough of the \"good stuff\" to coat the fries properly. I ordered the sweet corn Caesar as my entree thinking it sounded delicious but when the dish came I was totally disappointed. There was hardly any taste or flavor to it. I love caesar salads but this was just bland. The hard boiled egg that came on top of the salad was pink so I got a little excited thinking it would be pickled. It was not. The question still remains why was the egg pink if it wasn't pickled? My boyfriend and I also shared the french onion soup. We get french onion soup anywhere that has it on the menu, but again the broth lacked flavor. While I definitely wouldn't come here again for the food, they do have a lovely location on the capital with very nice decor! I especially liked the long booth across the entire length of the restaurant.\n",
      "Any time we are in Madison we make a stop here. Great modernized comfort/pub food. Always a treat!\n",
      "The host and waitstaff here were incredibly friendly and competent. The decor of the place is super cool. The beer list is amazing. I don't even like beer, but the waitress suggested Hennepin, which she described as \"Spotted Cow on steroids\" (I like spotted cow) and it was fantastic. We started with the poutine. It was sort of a mess. It was fries with gravy and melted cheese curds on top. We didn't get silverware right away, so it was a mess to eat. I got the burger and husband got the reuben. We ate the burger there, were full, and took the reuben home. Burger was cooked PERFECTLY. It was actually medium as ordered. Pork belly and cheese on top. It was awesome. Reuben was ok, didn't like the kraut soaked in beer. Couldn't really taste the swiss or the sauce. Overally, the food and service were pretty good. The main reason for three stars is the food was salty. And I am a girl that likes salt, so if I'm saying it's too salty, that means something. We would go back though.\n",
      "A very nice establishment on Capital Square. I second the fact that this place has the best beer selection in Madison by far! Oh, and the food is pretty good to boot! Very highly recommended if you like trying a BUNCH of different styles of beer!\n",
      "Had only been in coopers for drinks which are awesome! Bartenders are friendly and offer a great selection of beer. Last time we were in here we were intrigued by the menu and made plans to come in and try the selections. We went in last night around 9:00 for dinner. Started out with the pretzel appetizer. The pretzel was great however the Beer-Cheese sauce they served it with was lacking salt and balance. The sauce was extremely thin like it had sat in a heating well all day and broke down. Next we tried a bowl of their French Onion soup with gruyere and a side of mixed greens. We were a little confused why you would use fat tire from out of state when after all this is Wisconsin and we have tons of our very own local brews that fit. The soup came and we could smell that something had been scorched. Regardless we broke through the broiled cheese and dug in. It had good flavor but it finished with a bitter scorched taste...the same one we could smell. Little disappointing because Onions are cheap and every chef knows a good French Onion starts low and slow to get the perfect caramelization. The side salad was just spring mix with maybe a few drops of oil. Along with the soup we ordered a Veggie Platter. Not what we expected. It was 2 different types of hummus, along with 3 different pickled items. The beet hummus was what caught my eye first. Great taste but it looked like thickened Pepto on a plate...or something that comes out of Barneys mouth when he sneezes. The rest of the plate was average with Pickled Green beans, Pickled cabbage, frozen pita that was gently warmed and pickles. Not bad. We each ordered an Entree. The beef stew with dumplings and pretzel crusted chicken. The Stew was the farthest from the description you could imagine. It was on a bed of spätzle that had been cooked long before served. The stew was tomato based with brussel sprouts and 2 small cubes of beef. Looked and tasted like it had sat in a heating well all day and reduced to a tomato paste with what resembled to once be chunks of vegetables that had been long past braised. Took one bite each and there we sat broken hearted. Next the Pretzel Crusted Chicken with butternut squash hash and a whole grain mustard sauce. The hash was just diced butternut squash with no care to show knife skills and you guessed it....those damn brussel sprouts again. There was no salt or depth to the hash and I don't know what would classify it as a hash. The brussel sprouts were overcooked and brought back in a saute pan with oil and the squash. The chicken was dipped in an egg wash and dredged with pieces of pretzel and panko. Then, sadly, it was deep fried. It was a good sized breast and it was moist, but way over- salted. The whole grain cream sauce was good and a good pair. The execution on the whole dish was lacking however. The menu reminded me of bits and pieces of a few restaurants around town where I had seen these dishes before: Unami, Cadillac Ranch a.k.a Texas Tubbs West (RIP) and Brocach. The menu was intriguing and caught my eye but it had too many directions and was all over the board from Mediterranean to new American to Scottish. Cheers!! P.S.- Our server was great!! However when the FOH manager was addressed with the problems we had she begrudgingly comp'd the entrees and soup; then put her coat on and left for the night. Don't worry we won't be returning.\n",
      "One of the more inventive menus I've seen at a tavern. The mustard sauce on the pretzel crusted chicken was delicious, but the Brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing.\n",
      "I came here for lunch with coworkers. There were many middle-aged men and women in suits. As a party of five, we were seated in the back, in a private sectioned off space with flapping Western doors. It was quite nice. There was a mini door for the bartender to take our orders and hand us our food. I had the quiche, which was a huge slice of egg pie with brussel sprouts and ham. It was good, but I was expecting a 3-5 inch pie rather than a slice of something enormous. The salad that came with it is best forgotten rather than eaten. I had a bite of someone's ruben sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. Mm... definitely want to try that again. Nice place. The bar seems to have a lot of beer variety on tap. Good service.\n",
      "Stopped in here one Wednesday night after ringing bells for the Salvation Army at the Capitol square Walgreens for two hours in the cold and rain. It was crowded as always, but that's a sign of a great place worth waiting for; right? Right!! We were greeted immediately, seated within two minutes by some eye candy of a waiter (they were allll cute and I love being served by a man;always so sweet) I ordered my first \"hot toddy\" of the season and it was absolutely delish and unfroze my fingertips from bell ringing. We were going to get appetizer but decided to get the stuffed French chicken breast with mushroom risotto and it was the best I've ever had. I would take friends here, a first date, a gal pal ... Just perfect in every way. Thanks Cooper's!\n",
      "The food at this places was very good... Alcohol prices were pretty cheap and they have a large selection of pretty much everything. The chicken sandwich was pretty good, as for the chips they were burnt. Food took forever and did not come out at the same time. Service was very slow despite being one of the 4 tables in the place. I'd go back next time I am in town, but will seat at the bar.\n",
      "While visiting Madison for a trade show recently, my colleagues and I wandered into The Cooper's Tavern to escape the rain. Madison is a great beer city - I was really pleasantly surprised - and Cooper's Tavern represents. They've got a fantastic on tap menu as well as a great bottled selection, so there was definitely something for everyone. I ordered the pork belly mac n cheese. Oh my god the deliciousness. In fact, I texted my compatriot Chef Lucy to ooh and goo over the taste. The sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly complimented by the sharp white Wisconsin cheddar and I loved it. My dinner companions also enjoyed their meals (though I can't recall for the life of me what they ordered). It was pouring outside so we elected to stay in the warm cozy restaurant for dessert and shared the Guinness chocolate cake - another solid choice. The crowd was mixed but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and I'll for sure go back if I find myself in Madison again.\n",
      "We went to Coopers for dinner. It is by the Capitol, street parking available. We were fortunate and did not have to wait for a table. Our server was professional and helpful. I had the New Glarus Belgian Red. It was good. We shared beer cheese pretzels, which were okay and the croquettes which were amazing. I had the chicken sandwich and it was very good, served hot with chips. Very reasonable.\n",
      "First the up side. They have an amazing beer list, which features a wide range of styles, regions and tastes. The server was attentive and responsive. The item I ordered was a Cobb salad featuring corned beef, which turned out to be little more than an accent with about six very small cubes each measuring a quarter inch in diameter. I guess I wrongly assumed that when you include a specific meat in the name of an entree salad, that it would have \"star billing\". One of the other diners ordered a reuben sandwich and cup of reuben soup, each of which required no less than three beers to quash the residual salty taste. I will probably take a chance at lunch, but if that is as unsatisfactory an experience, I will have no problem finding other places to patronize in downtown Madison.\n",
      "I swear to god...one of these days, Yelp will give us the option for half-stars. Until then, it's going to be three for me (whereas it would've been 3.5). I like Cooper's. Really, I do. The food is pretty solid, and so is the beer selection. The problem? Well, it's overpriced. A lot of their beers run $5+, and while that's a bargain price in DC or NY, this is Madison, and I don't expect to pay that much. Even their specialty selection, which usually has a sour or two, is way too much. The selection is good overall, but if I want to really go all out, I'll head over to Maduro or out east to The Malthouse. Now, the food? Well, as with most Food Fight places, it's hit or miss. Stealthily delicious hummus platter (I think it's beet hummus, but not sure), so-so sliders and so-so poutine (pronounced \"Putin\", believe it or not). Cooper's has a really cool atmosphere, but the meh quality of the food and pricey beer list is keeping me from giving it more than 3 stars. Would I hang out there? Absolutely, as long as I didn't plan on drinking a lot.\n",
      "Not sure about this place. Not the best service. I understand not wanting people, who aren't eating, to use up your tables when busy. But when 3/4 of the place is empty - don't make it a point, when we come in, to tell us to sit at the bar. Though the drinks were great, it took a bit too long for the bartenders to notice us. You would think that sitting behind the beer pulls would show that we are REALLY into beer...\n",
      "One of my favorite places to go to on the square! It's a short 5 minute walk from my apartment so I've been here a good number of times already. I love the beer list - with my favorite being the Monk's sour beer (not the full name of the beer but my memory is terrible - sorry!). The food has been a bit hit or miss for me and I do sometimes wish there were some more options. It's more of a comfort food menu (e.g. grilled cheese, reuben, mac & cheese, etc.) but sadly without the option of cheese curds! The upstairs is great and if it is open - I would definitely recommend going up there. I also love that this is a go-to place for any soccer games including the world cup, English premier league, & Spanish premier league! It's always great to connect & cheer on with other fans :). Finally, in my experience, the service (including hosts as well) here has been phenomenal. Very attentive & knowledgeable.\n",
      "The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful, the food is great, and moderately priced. It was a great place to grab lunch in the middle of the week. Beware, it can get quite busy, and there's a good reason for that.\n",
      "We ordered the poutine. No gravy and was flavorless! Beer pretzels were gross!!! Ran out of Caesar dressing so couldn't get a salad. Bottom line, don't come here for the food. Just the beer and cute wait staff.\n",
      "This is a great place to go watch soccer. They always have soccer games playing, and there are always other soccer fans around. On Saturday mornings for premiere league soccer, sometimes they open the upstairs area which is taken over by hardcore soccer fans. It's a lot of fun because you can watch soccer games on a big projector screen and hear singing/chanting/cheering from all the soccer fans. It does get pretty loud and crowded and is hard to get a table sometimes, but it's a great place to go if you enjoy soccer. The downstairs area is the main restaurant/bar and has a nice atmosphere. They have lots of great beers on tap, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable. The food here is really good. They have a good variety of options on the menu. I would definitely recommend this place.\n",
      "Love the brunch here! I've had the steak and the eggs Benedict before. Both are amazing!. This place is especially awesome in the summer when you can eat outside m!\n",
      "Very good food!! Belgian frites and malt vinegar aioli!!! YUM!!!! Sconnie eggs-terrific!!! Pork belly Mac-good but didn't need the pork belly, didn't make sense with the dish. Leaving happy and very full!!!!!\n",
      "Met some friends for dinner/drinks before concert! Thought the place would be a mad house due to college graduation weekend. Nicely surprised to have a hopping place, but not loud and crazy wait times, etc. Place had a great selection of beers. We enjoyed a couple different options! Dinner... I had a hankering for chicken! So I had the \"airline chicken\". (Can't remember the exact name of the dish, but the description calls it airline chicken) Was a beautiful spinach stuffed chicken breast with a flavorful crust. Not like a breaded crust but a seared chicken skin type thing... YUM! The chicken was served on a very nice risotto with white wine (?) cream sauce!!! Would come back here for the chicken and great selection of beers! Hubs had the fish and chips. He enjoyed it. Since my meal was so satisfying and big, I didn't sample it. I like everything about this place! Service, beer selection, food and atmosphere!\n",
      "This is the perfect place for a quick lunch or a nice sit down dinner! Every meal I've had there has been wonderful and the beer selection is fantastic. I seem to recall delicious bloody marys as well... The outdoor seating gives you an awesome view of the capital! And they are dog friendly too (for outdoor seating).\n",
      "Went here after 9pm on a Saturday night. We wanted to sit outside- the place was packed inside and out, so had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Glad we sat outside though, as inside was really loud. Awesome beer and wine selection, just about anything you could want. My friend was unhappy with his bloody mary, didn't have enough spice. We were told the kitchen closed at 10, so we had to hurry up and get our orders in. I had the brisket sandwich, which I thought lacked flavor and was pretty unimaginative. Wish I would have ordered the beef stew- it was really tasty and comfort food at its best. The service was pretty good despite how busy the place looked. The whole experience was decent, but probably won't go out of my way to come back.\n",
      "Amazing food, amazing service! My party of 7 was seated in the little private room off the bar, where we were served through a window by the bartender. Maybe not for everyone, but I loved the ambience and the bartender was very friendly and attentive. One of our appetizers was late due to a kitchen mistake, and the house gave it to us for free in addition to giving us 2 free desserts! I am new to the Midwest and have never experienced such excellent service. It was absolutely unprecedented but so appreciated. I also loved how their vegetarian entree option wasn't the standard boring roast vegetables but a delicious mushroom manicotti. I would recommend if to omnivores as well, it was incredible! The walnuts were an extremely tasty touch to an already tender and flavorful dish. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and it has made me excited to return!\n",
      "This place has a great atmosphere and an extensive beer list. They also have a bunch of whiskeys and bourbons. I really love the views from there seating areas. That being said, their food is often mediocre and is entirely over-priced. The best foods are the Sconnie eggs and the truffle fries. Go here to drink, not to eat.\n",
      "I went here a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed the view of the capitol building from the outdoor seating. Definitely a great place if you have people visiting for the view. It looked like they had a pretty good selection of beverages however I did not try any this time. I did have the Pretzel Encrusted Chicken which was just okay. By all means not horrible but it did not make me want to get it a second time if I were to return. The service was good so I don't hesitate to make another visit.\n",
      "I'll start by saying this restaurant should have a higher rating, but for one serious mistake, which I'll get to. Service - Excellent. Our server was charming, knew the food & beer, fast and efficient. Food - Fairly good. The presentation was great, but the Poutine was just cheese fires with gravy. Now having spent much time in Montreal, i'm a bit of a poutine purist, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. Fish and chips were good, thought the fries weren't quite up to \"chip\" standards. Drink - EXCELLENT! What a killer beer list, and the staff knew their stuff. Ambiance - Very good. Maybe turn down the lights a bit. THE BAD: We were really enjoying the food when my friend found a BIG PIECE OF PLASTIC IN HIS BURGER. It was the kind that patties often come wrapped in. This was not a small piece either, it was a ball of thick, clear plastic the size of 2 peas. My friend was very gracious and knew the cook. He told the server to tease him about it but didn't raise a stink - didn't mention it to the owner either. I wouldn't have been so gracious - hence the 3 star review for a 4 star place.\n",
      "This is a review for the bartender. First off, he kept referring to us as girls which I found rude. Then when he finally came over to serve us I asked if there was a cocktail list. Not something I thought would be crazy considering it's a restaurant. Apparently they don't have one, and instead of just telling me this the bartender goes \"This is a beer and whiskey place, we're not at the KK\". I'm 30 years old, I haven't been to the KK in years. I thought it was extremely rude and I won't be going back. Bad customer service.\n",
      "So...Cooper's Tavern, the new Food Fight Restaurant.... My husband and I went here for dinner on a Monday evening. It was threatening to rain, so we opted to sit inside. The sidewalk seating looks like it would be really enjoyable on nicer days, though. There was live celtic music, a group of 4 people playing their instruments in the back. It really reminded of the celtic bars I frequented when I used to live in Brittany, France. The volume of the music was just right- loud enough to notice, but not so loud that you had to shout to have a conversation. Our waitress was prompt, but she forgot to tell us the specials, one of which was Mussels and fries, which I would have ordered had I known about them. I ordered the grilled cheese and house salad; husband had the lamb sandwich and home made chips. The grilled cheese was good and the salad mix was fresh. I tasted the chips and thought they could be better. They were on the dry and bland side. (Maybe use peanut oil for frying and some more salt?) My husband liked his lamb sandwich. This would probably be a 3 star review, as it's a run-of-the-mill Food Fight restaurant, but the huge and interesting beer menu and live music give it the fourth star.\n",
      "First, the space is really cool looking. It's definitely got the well-worn gastropub feel, even though it's brand new. I was really impressed with the decor, even though it isn't quite as charming as some of the other nearby establishments (though if it sticks around for a while, that will come with age). On a Friday night at around 8pm, our little twosome got right in even though I was worried that there would be a wait. We were seated near the kitchen, which meant waitresses flying around too close to my chair for comfort, but at least we got to eat soon after we arrived. We had to try the poutine, skin-on french fries with some cheese curds covered in a brown gravy (have I mentioned how my boy loves gravy?). What a tasty treat, although I think it had sat somewhere for a little bit too long because the gravy had taken on an unappealing sheen. That being said, it tasted great and the fries weren't soggy at all. This is a great alternative to cheesy bacon fries, if you're into that sort of thing. This is not health food. For our dinners I went with the reuben (with house-cured lean corn beef sliced thin, cured red cabbage, swiss cheese, and dressing on pumpernickel) and he had the burger, which was very juicy. For my side I chose the greens with house vinaigrette and he had homemade potato chips. Both of these were great, and I appreciate the lighter choice of greens (they definitely don't scrimp on portions either.. I got half a plate of romaine!). We were very satisfied with the food we'd chosen. I also got a Murphy's Irish Ale, served in a true pint glass. Our server was attentive, no complaints there. The only thing I was a bit bothered by was the beer options. While the bottle selection was just fine, I'm a draft girl and there weren't that many appealing options. Hopefully the cooper's tavern will have a rotating schedule and maybe offer this poor grad student some specials (maybe pitcher specials) so that I can continue to eat my way through the menu one weekend at a time!\n",
      "So good. Everyone tends to go here for drinks, which is great- I love the atmosphere and the beer selection at night, but it does get a little crowded. The news I have or you is that this place is not just a bar. I'll say I'm biased and just love the idea of this place - a nice pub feel for those of us that wish to be closer to our irish and english roots with some of those traditional selections on the menu (guiness and irish breakfast complete with black and white pudding, anyone?) but they also have more american options and contemporary or unique spins on \"regular\" food, one of my other favorite things to experience. I also appreciate that they have hooks for hanging jackets and purses dispersed throughout the seating area. The food is excellent - everything seems high quality and well prepared. I'll be back for more for sure. Today I went for brunch and it was amazing. Great service, nice casual atmosphere and TVs for watching the Packers or Manchester United vs. Chelsea. Awesome cocktails and food selection - their bloody mary is intense and their breakfast menu has a good mix of items for anyone to find something they like and you can be sure it will taste great. I had the breakfast sandwich which was good and super filling and I think the english muffin it came on is homemade - this is NOT the english muffin you buy at the grocery store, it is so much better. One friend had the scrambler - the potatoes were awesome and they were happy to prepare it partially with egg whites for her. They scramble in different ingredients every day - hers was goat cheese, tomato and red pepper. The blueberry marscarpone that comes with the french toast is amazing and they give you plenty so you don't run out. I was ready to eat my friend's leftovers off his plate with a spoon :) I highly recommend the Pimm's Cup if you're debating over it on the cocktail menu - it's very refreshing and delicious - don't be intimidated by it.\n",
      "This place is AWESOME! I've only been there twice, but both times were excellent. Food was great and very reasonably priced. The beer selection is huge, but I have only been there for lunch time and did not imbibe. Overall, the atmosphere is very relaxing and best suited for grabbing one or two friends for a casual drink or meal. Definitely a good addition to the downtown eatery scene. I didn't see any room for large groups.\n",
      "I've been here twice: once a packed Saturday night and once a lazy Sunday afternoon. On both occasions I thought the food and service were fine. I have no complaints, but also nothing incredible to report. To be honest, the only reason I came back the second time was because I couldn't get in to Cento. It wasn't my first choice, but there were no terrible memories holding me back either. The one thing that bugs me is that they tout having locally made bread and locally made beer, but then serve you butter from Ireland. Hello?\n",
      "Very tasty food! We only tried the poutine and the sliders from the appetizer menu! Both were two thumbs up, amazing! Very large beer menu as well:) best part was it was within walking distance of our hotel and a lot of other places!!!\n",
      "I went to Cooper's with my parents for my birthday dinner. Walking in you are immediately impressed with the decor and the crowd packed into the narrow space. We started off with some great drinks at the bar due to the 30 minute wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. Bartenders were friendly and prompt. The Snoqualmie naked organic wine was particularly awesome. Beer selection adveturous and tasty. Once we finally got seated is where the night soured a bit and the reason for the 3 stars. Our waitress was as efficient as a broken broom. She did not deliver our food. Not a big deal except for the fact she never once checked in on us to ask how the food was and such. The next time we saw her after taking our order was to drop off the check after we flagged her down. I had to verbally call her over to the table to get a new glass of wine as she was never around to cue with a simple hand gesture. Collecting her check quickly was the only skill she possessed. However, the food was delicious. I had the pork belly mac and cheese. The way the pork flavors mixed with the mac and cheese seasonings was superb. My parents got a pair of sandwiches which were solid. I would definitely go back simply for the beer and wouldn't mind eating there again provided I wouldn't be served by that waitress again.\n",
      "Visited on Saturday night, so the place was hopping. The wait wasn't bad at all for that time of night, and they had a bar upstairs where we could order drinks and an appetizer while we waited. The Poutine was yummy! Unfortunately, the Pork Belly Mac was a bit bland. They do have a very extensive wine and beer list. Our service that night was friendly, but somewhat slow. After waiting for half an hour for a table, it was another 10 before we even got a menu. Overall, it was good enough that I would go again, but not amazing.\n",
      "I have to say my husband and I were very unhappy with what we experienced at Cooper's Tavern. The first time we went was during brunch. Our thought was if it is on the square you would think that it has to have something good going on. Well.........apparently not. We went in and they asked us if it was our first time dining there and we told them no, now one would think that since it was our first time and they knew it they would give us a \"good show\" We ordered our drinks that did not show up till the end of our meal which I asked several times where they were, the food was bland and we had to pay for the drinks! If they had good customer service they would've said \"the drinks are on us.\" Did I mention that they weren't busy?!?! I emailed later that night and was told they got new servers and just give it another go. Well like dummies we did. The second time the service was better but the food was crap. I ordered the Reuben and I literally couldn't chew the meat! It was like eating a tire. My husband got the brisket sandwich which consisted of fatty meat. NEVER AGAIN!\n",
      "Good overall atmosphere. Not too loud, but enough where it was lively and you're not shouting at each other. I literally just had one glass of Moscato wine the whole 2 hours I was there, but it was a damn good one. Service was great, even though our table just had drinks and fries. We weren't ignored like some would typically, especially since we weren't ordering full meals. Definitely coming back to try the menu.\n",
      "Dined at 11:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. My friend and I were the only people there at the time but closer to noon the place fills up. I ordered the Amys salad and my friend ordered the veggie sandwich. My salad was excellent, the fried goat cheese alone was enough to make me want to come back. I tried a portion of the veggie sandwich, which was an unusual take on a sandwich, but it was thoughtfully crafted to be delicious. Service was great, very attentive, but not suffocating. I would go back to try their dinner offerings and beverage selection.\n",
      "Sitting in the location that was formerly Sucre - it just goes to show that Wisconsin loves our beer more than our dessert. I got the Mac n cheese with pork belly. My friend got the goat cheese polenta. We also tried the pretzels with beer cheese sauce. Overall, I liked that they have unusual stuff on their menu (polenta, pork belly, brussel sprouts and beets). They've got a selection of beers like so many places in Madison. It's definitely worth a try but it won't end up being a favorite. Service: Slow, but it was packed. My friend and I got our appetizer after our entrees. Also all the waitresses look the same. Environment: Nice light wood decor. Most of the tables inside are against a long bench (so you get one seat on the bench and one chair). Tables are really close together. Some outdoor seating. A little bit loud given that I went on a full night. UPDATE: Went for brunch. Just after it snowed, so it was empty. But by far, I liked the brunch better than the dinner. I got the Benedict Arnold - poached eggs on biscuit with sausage gravy. My friend got the regular Eggs Benedict. Both were delicious.\n",
      "Cooper's is a good option for beer and \"fancy\" bar food in a casual pub-like atmosphere. I like to take friends here from out of town because it's good, but it's unimposing. I don't feel like I need to eat a full meal here which makes it a good place to hang out and drink without being rushed. The outside seating in the summer is an excellent option. I love the fries and malt vinegar aioli in particular!\n",
      "Went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband--we'd been meaning to try it for awhile. We sat inside, I forget why, but in the future I think I would try to avoid it--they have this set-up with a long bench along the wall, tables, and chairs on the facing side, which gives it more of a fast food feel than I really like, plus the tables are TINY. I felt like I was being squashed into people on both sides of me, and it was noisy. We split an order of chips (fries) before the meal, and they were AMAZING. Really well done, just the right texture for me (relatively thin for home-made chips, but still just a little soft like I like them, not too many burnt ones), and they came with a DELICIOUS vinegar-infused aoli for dipping. Husband had some beer that he really liked, and obviously that's their main deal. I had some wine and it was okay, but I remember thinking that the selection was pretty thin. I realize it's not their primary thing, but it could have had a little more variety. For the entree, I had the grilled cheese with a \"shot\" of their Harvest Tomato soup. I didn't realize when I ordered that they LITERALLY meant a \"shot\"--like, it was served in a shot glass, which was INCREDIBLY inconvenient since it was nearly impossible to dip the sandwich in it, even shredded into small pieces. What do they think people DO with grilled cheese and tomato soup?! The container really needed a broader mouth, even if it had held the same volume. The soup was really good--very flavorful, just a hint of spice, very nice. The server also said she THOUGHT that it was vegan, although she couldn't confirm--she said the chef likes to do vegan stuff when he can. The grilled cheese, though, was really disappointing. The menu listed three kinds of cheese, including cheddar, but it just had no flavor at ALL. Totally bland. I'd have been happier with a full bowl of the soup. If you don't like to be crowded, I'd recommend trying to sit outside in the next few months rather than inside. And avoid the grilled cheese.\n",
      "We tried Cooper's for the first time this weekend and it was fantastic. A little crowded - but hey, it was Friday night. I highly recommend the ham sandwich on a pretzel bun. I do not recommend the pretzel breadsticks. The pretzel itself is fine - but the cheese dipping sauce is bland. We added salt to the sauce, which helped a bit. Still... I'd rather save the calories for the meal. We sat by the front window which was a great people-watching opportunity. The beer selection was good - but of course I'm lame and ordered my go-to beer: Lake Louie's Scotch Ale. You just can't beat it. We'll be back for sure. UPDATE: We tried Cooper's for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was so good we returned the following Saturday. Their breakfast sandwiches on giant English muffins are fantastic - and I highly recommend the banana bread french toast. YUM.\n",
      "I just came home from an amazing meal at Coopers Tavern and feel that I've finally eaten here enough to not only give it a five star review, but also consider it my favorite restaurant on the square. First of all, Coopers Tavern has great food. They serve one of my favorite burgers in Madison, which may not sound like much, but truthfully I've only found two places in Madison with burgers that are actually both tasty and worth the price (The other being Dotty's, of course). Other than that their cheese curds are amazing and their fish and chips are super good. I just came back from eating the steak frites and while I didn't love them quite as much as their burger, it was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The seasonal vegetables(green beans, tonight) were delicious, and I could see myself ordering it again if I didn't want to try everything else on their menu. Then we have the Brandy Old Fashioned. It is absolutely to die for. Seriously. No further comment needed. Third and most importantly, the service here goes above and beyond all expectations. Our server tonight was Brie and she was absolutely warm and inviting from the get go. We ran into a problem with the fish and chips being a little bit too cold (not bad or anything, just a little cool) she did everything in her power to make sure we were taken care of and happy. Luckily all it took was throwing them in the deep fryer for a minute or two; we're not too difficult. The order of fish and chips was comped by the manager, but we would have honestly been happy and I still would have written this 5-star review either way just based off how great the service was. Yes, the seating is a little cramped, but I've never had a problem hearing anyone in my party or with any other restaurant goers, so I certainly don't see it as a problem. All in all, the food and service here are great and definitely worth every penny.\n",
      "Just went here for lunch, and I was rather pleased. I was impressed with the beer list, not just for its selection of local and Belgian beers (which seem to be ubiquitous in Madison), but for the other not so common finds (an homage to eastern Europe and the Pacific for example) and what I would call American staples (Anchor Steam, Founder's, and Unibroue - notice I said American). As far as food goes - my ladyfriend and I had the harvest soup, which was quite good. I had the turkey sandwich with apple-pear slaw and thousand island dressing, and she had the chicken sandwich on sourdough. We both felt that the turkey sandwich won that fight, it was excellent. The rest of the menu sounds great, especially dinner. The penchant for pork products is nice to see. View of the capital is really nice. Interior is clean and modern. I liked the light wood bar. Service was great, but the place wasn't exactly bustling. I held off on giving 5 stars, because it seems like this place has a bit of evolving to do yet. Still kind of new/green, and not a particularly original menu (kind of a mix between The Old Fashioned and Brasserie V). I am definitely coming back for dinner though.\n",
      "I had a pleasant experience at Cooper's Tavern. I was with three other people and was seated right away. The food was delicious. We got two appetizers (beer cheese pretzels and croquettes) and it was a good choice since both appetizers didn't have a lot of food with them. I had the sliders for my main course and it was the perfect size. I was stuffed by the end of the meal. The overall experience was ok. It is very dark and REALLY loud, but they had a nice selection of food and drinks and everyone seemed to be content.\n",
      "Okay Cooper's, I want to be friends with you. There is so much potential here ready to be unleashed, and I want to be there when you do. Unfortunately, there are a few glaring issues that prevent me from truly being your friend or your BFF. Let's keep talking to see how it goes, and we can consider a relationship later. We visited Cooper's on a weeknight for a bite to eat and to meet with a friend. We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. First off, your view of the Capitol building is amazing. Second off, why do you have customers share tables? I mentioned in my Pig in a Fur Coat review that normally this is an awkward experience. Cooper's, it was awkward. I want my own table and to not share the paper pushing discussion of the two coworkers getting a bite after work. Cooper's has a very solid beer list. If there isn't something on tap they have listed because you're \"that person,\" (no worries, I'm sometimes \"that person too\" so don't feel bad), there will be at least 5 beers available in bottle that you will craze. Cooper's has you covered. There were no cheese curds on the menu... I don't know how that is possible, but it was. I guess Cooper's isn't trying to be Old Fashioned too hard! Since cheese curds were out of the option we ordered pretzels with a Guinness sauce as an appetizer. Major props on the sauce guys. Anyone can make a soft-pretzel well, but most people will serve it with garlic sauce or cheese product. While I may enjoy those at a sporting event, I want something more for dinner. Your sauce works, it's awesome. I want it bottled. Now here is where it gets awkward. I ordered the lobster mac n' cheese for dinner. It was $19, and I was expecting something solid because we're in Wisconsin so ordering a dinner based around cheese is a no brainer. It wasn't good, guys. I was greatly let down by this dish, and I do not think it should sit on the menu for $19 or exist at all. The lobster was overcooked and chewy. I could barely taste the cheese. It's mac n CHEESE, Cooper's! I know you probably got distracted in the grocery store by that bottle of truffle oil and forgot to buy enough cheese but come on! It's unfortunate that the primary ingredients didn't deliver. Well, at least the pasta was cooked properly. Back to the truffle oil, why? I know you think you're Alinea, but you're not. Truffle oil is gimmicky and it makes everything else taste like truffle oil. It absolutely overpowered every single other ingredient in the food, which is a HUGE problem when you are serving lobster. Lobster is ridiculously easy to out flavor with other ingredients. Let the lobster shine, guys. It's the feature of the dish! The entree did come with a salad. The ingredients were crispy and the dressing was delicious. I think I enjoyed the salad more than the main feature. Service was about what I expect. Drinks were topped off, we were asked how everything was. It was nothing exceptional or disappointing. Kudos! Cooper's, I want to like you, and I appreciate many things about you, but that one dish was executed so poorly that I cannot look past it. Let's continue to hang out with other people, but we can keep our options open. If we do hang out, please don't bring Dave, the lobster mac n cheese with you. No one likes Dave.\n",
      "I probably built this place up in my mind too much before I ended up here. It's been awhile since I've been to Canada and I've been having a craving for poutin. After consulting Yelp I found this place as somewhere in the US I might go for my fix. Since I had a business trip planned to Milwaukee it wasn't much more of a drive to get to Madison. I figured if there was a place outside of Ontario or Quebec to get good poutin it had to be Wisconsin, home of the cheese curd. So on a rainy afternoon I headed to Madison. The first bringdown about this place is its location so close to the capital. Trying to park anywhere near Cooper's is a pain. And when it's raining it's even worse. Having finally found parking I then ran in the rain to get to the restaurant. I get in, am immediately seated and get a menu. A big positive for the place is its beer selection. I was able to get a draft of a California beer I like cheaper there than when I am in California. I ordered poutin and sliders from the menu. The poutin came out first and my heart sank after seeing it. It was made with YELLOW cheese curds and the gravy was like a light brown sausage gravy. Most horrible. EVERYBODY knows poutin is made with WHITE cheese, mozzarela, montery jack or even cheddar, and a thick BROWN gravy. Broke my heart when it came out. The taste wasn't much better. The gravy and fries were barely warm so the cheese couldn't melt which made the whole thing an unappetizing mess. The sliders weren't bad but I hadn't come for the sliders. After eating I trudged back to my car in the rain. Pricewise not bad for beer but a bit pricey for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food. 3 stars for the good beer price.\n",
      "The beer selections (solid list of bottles and usually good rotating tap list) are the highlight when you come here. I feel the food is good and the menu has a variety of options but I haven't found a dish that would compel me to come back just so I could have it again. On the other hand, when they have St. Bernadus Abt 12 on tap, save me a seat at the bar.\n",
      "If Coopers wasn't on the Capitol square, no one would go to it. This is the most overrated place in town. I've been several times and every time it's packed and the food is mediocre. Don't expect to be able to have a conversation with just your dining companion(s) because the tables are so close to each other you're all practically eating together. I think we're supposed to think that's charming. I just find it irritating. We went last week before a show at the Overture. My brisket sandwich was dry and over-cooked and The Boyfriend's pork chop was similarly dry and overdone. What a bummer. Good beer selection and the Belgian frites were ok (though under-salted and putting aoli in a shot glass is not really attractive...), but we won't be back anytime soon.\n",
      "You can't go wrong with the Coop(yep, so good that we have a nickname)! The cheese curds... Normally I think they are all the same, but there's truly stand out. I recommend anything really, but I tried the Caesar with salmon, and it was abundant with ingredients and prepared nicely.\n",
      "Honestly, the all-around experience of Cooper's Tavern gives this place a unique style. In conjunction with its location on the Square, I am positive it will thrive for years to come! The food is usually well presented. In fact, I can only recall one specific time where I ate a vegetarian polenta dish that was rather bland and uninteresting (No...the reason for that is NOT because it was a vegetarian option). The atmosphere is very lively, and a drawback from a 5-star rating would be the noise. Cooper's Tavern is certainly noisy, but that's a part of the Euro-tavern charm and experience. Also, as a coffee LOVER (a true one...not simply someone who simply drinks a lot of it), their coffee selection is abysmal. It always tastes bland and even burned at times. I keep forgetting to ask what brand it is, but it doesn't matter. It's just not great and never has been. One big push toward 4.5 stars, is their brunch. It's delicious!! If you dine on a weekend for brunch, put a group of 6 or more together and dine in the fun, cute, and intimate table closed off to the main area. It's connected right to the bar by a small window where the wait staff interacts with you from the bar area. It's kind of a neat, unique experience! The fact that I've taken dates, siblings, parents and relatives, co-workers, and friends here numerous times says a lot (even if the coffee stinks)!!\n",
      "Great food - we really enjoyed \"Amy's Salad\" and the pork and mac 'n cheese. The service and beer selection were great! It was VERY noisy - perhaps they could add some noice absorbing bumpers on the wall - or artwork?\n",
      "Pretty good food. I had the beet hummus and a chicken sandwich. I felt like the old lady in the Wendy's ad when I got my sandwich. The bread was huge but the chicken was actually a serving. I removed 3/4 of the bread and had a correctly portioned sandwich. Some in my party had dessert. The Guinness cupcake looked and was reported to be tremendous.\n",
      "Unimpressed. My husband and I walk in and a very polite man tells us there is no room on this floor, to either go upstairs or downstairs. Um, k? We go upstairs and are seated immediately. No one comes by for our drink order for forever, the girl who finally does knows nothing. The menu has something about a beer of the month. I ask her what is this, to which she responds 'I don't know, it changes every day, I don't think we have one.\" Uhhhh huh. My husband and I ordered cheese curds from her before reviewing the menu, just assuming they had some, and we were brought fries with cheese and gravy. They were good enough, but not at all cheese curds. Now a guy finally comes by and says he's our waiter. He goes on a rant about how they have NO specials (it's a Friday night). Our friend wanted fish so questions him. He is flustered and a bit rude to her, she only wanted to know if there was some kind of Friday night fish. Geez sorry dood. Guess you don't like tips. My pork belly mac was meh. Would have been better if they just skipped the pork all together and just made it a vegetarian mac and cheese dish. My husbands rueben had waaaaaaaaay too much meat and not nearly enough of anything else. He was disappointed. 1 star for accommodating our friend with Celiac. 1 star for sparking a fun conversation about how much to tip for sub par service.\n",
      "Nice little place by the capitol. Great place to grab some drinks or get some brunch. Other than brunch, the only time I had food was when we had to get an appetizer to drink our beers at a table. Didn't really feel like getting any food at the time.. but we ended up getting pretzels and cheese or something.. and it was not worth its price. at all. Brunch is good. I got the breakfast sandwich on one occasion and a benedict on another. I was satisfied. I just love the atmosphere and I think if I went for dinner when I was hungry I would have a different review in terms of food. They have the left handed milk stout draught, which is my fave. One thing I wasn't a big fan of was that they would constantly ask us if we wanted to order any other drinks or food.. to the point where it felt a little pushy. It passed the point where they are asking to provide good service. I want to give it 3.5 stars, but I bumped it because of the atmosphere and pretty satisfied brunch experience. It's a little more than A-OK.\n",
      "Thank you, kind bartender, for humoring my request for a hot, non-alcoholic drink at the bar. I swear I did not mean to leave my ID back at my hotel room. It was 8PM and I had already done all my research on all the bars in the vicinity of the Madison Concourse hotel. So I decided that I wanted to start my tavern hopping adventure right with a beer and pretzeled bread at The Cooper's Tavern. It wasn't until I had walked in and sat myself down at the bar that I realized that I only had a credit card and some cash in my pocket...and I wasn't about to trek back out into the cold back to my hotel room to get my ID because I knew that if I made it back to my king-sized bed and flatscreen TV, I would never make it back outside. SO, long story short, I ended up sipping a hot chocolate (from powder) while I waited for my pretzeled bread, pretending to be interested in whatever soccer game was playing on the TVs behind the bar. Good thing I was impressed with the pretzeled bread (I actually had a random craving for that and spicy mustard earlier last week), or I would have been a very, very unhappy camper. Sad to say, my tavern hopping adventures ended with my last drop of hot-chocolate. However, I'm glad that I made Cooper's my first stop! Nice try Sherry, maybe next time.\n",
      "On the beautiful second floor of Coopers Tavern we hosted a Happy Hour for what we thought was going to be about 30 clients and ended up turning into a Happy Hour for about 50+ clients. The Coopers Tavern staff worked with us to make sure every guest was served promptly at the bar and when our appetizer table started to run low (due to the awesome turnout) their main kitchen staff pulled together and allowed us to order additional appetizers from their main menu!! We could not have been more pleased with their Events Coordinator and the staff for that evening. Our guests really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and set up of Coopers because it allowed them to mingle comfortably with our staff and other guests. The view of the capital was an added bonus!\n",
      "Great view of the capital. Food was outstanding and great beer choice. The flank steak special had wonderful flavor, fine presentation, and excellent service.\n",
      "Great beer, great frites, great location, pretty cool environment...but for vegetarian with few options, what is up with the boring grilled cheese? Went back and ordered without the provolone and extra (supposedly sharp) cheddar cheese...still pretty boring. How about some onions, tomatoes, avocado, pesto?\n",
      "I've been for brunch couple of times, and the experience was nothing to write home about at best, or just bad. Pros: -Staff is extremely nice, has a good sense of humor -Great beer selection -Bloody Marys are good, reasonably priced Large, well-placed TV screens Cons: -Service was slow - my friend's mimosa was comped because it took so long to get -We were near the end of brunch (I think), and there were three different menu items that we wanted, that they had run out of. If you don't have it, let us know before we make up our minds to order -The Steak & Eggs were cold within a couple of minutes, the steak was tough, and the sauce tasted strangely chlorine-y (or soap-y?). They had run out of their duck-fat eggs, and for $15 the dish was bland -Coffee was mediocre, had to flag the server down for a refill\n",
      "Great Beer selection! Food was fantastic. Chorizo sandwich and Amy's salad. Fresh and fast.\n",
      "I've eaten here twice and try not to go back. I wish there were more decent dining options on the Square for entertaining out-of-town guests... Anyway, the first time I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich. I don't really like grilled cheese and only order them when there are no palatable meat-free options. It was the usual mess of grease on bread. The highlight was the shot of harvest soup, but again that was only a shot. The second time we came here was because The Old Fashioned was too busy. I was fine with that because I'm not a fan of their food, but my friends were visiting and were really excited about the variety of cheese curds. To make up for the lack of cheese curds, we ordered the poutine. Having traveled extensively in Canada, I can say this was a far cry from the original (true, we did get the gravy on the side). The cheese was lumpy, waxy mess in the middle, and the fries were cold and soggy. We didn't even finish them, and who doesn't finish their fries?! I really liked the Venetian Manicotti, though the buckwheat crepe was rather grainy. That could be the nature of buckwheat, I'm not sure. I'd definitely order it again, especially if I come here with someone I don't want to talk to. My friends all seemed reasonably pleased with their meals, though it was hard to tell because I couldn't hear a word they said. Between the horrendous acoustics and multiple TVs (with the volume on!), my friends and I quickly learned any attempt at conversation was fruitless. The whole meal made me feel sad and lonely, because I could see my friends but not talk to them. It made us eat quickly and run out of there. One positive note: I think all the ambient noise mimicked the sounds of my friend's womb. Her little baby slept through the whole meal. It was quite nice for us grown-ups. Too bad we couldn't talk to each other about how lovely it was to have adult conversation. I don't drink beer, so I ordered a Magner's. It came in a pint glass, which I'm sure would have been appreciated if I were an alcoholic or like to consume 1500 calories per meal. I drank less than half of it. It would be nice to have smaller portions, for those of us who don't like to feel the need purge upon dining.\n",
      "BEWARE!! They food poisoned me, I had 6 hours of agonizing pain, cold sweats, diarrhea and nausea. I'm allergic to milk; no its not a sensitivity or lactose intolerance, it's a full on allergy. I made the waitress aware, even though I triple checked with her and sent my food back when I saw it had a dairy based dressing on it, they still managed to poison me. They put cheese in my sandwich and it was melted in so I couldn't see it until I was 3/4 through it. When I found out I alerted the waitress and she spoke with the owner. The coward hide in the back and they told her to give me the sandwich for free. Gee thanks a free $10 sandwich in exchange for 6 hours of hell. Sure not everyone has an allergy and I deal with this a lot. But think on this, if they don't take a potentially life threatening situation seriously, what else don't they take seriously? Food safety, cleanliness? Who knows.. Food safety is serious and it's important for everyone, we can all get food poisoning. Don't eat here, the owner clearly doesn't care if their patrons are hurt by their food.\n",
      "Great food n outstanding beer selections. First time here. Definitely will be back. Sliders n beer cheese pretzels were outstanding. Beer prices r a little high. Beware.\n",
      "Coopers is first and foremost for me a bar. They serve food, and good food, but what they excel at is a great and varied beer list. Ive had good salads and frites there so I would recommend it for a date or night out with friends. The downstairs is long and narrow and when its a weekend it can be difficult to drink there if you cannot sit at the bar. The upstairs is spacious and offers great views of the capital. Outside seating also makes it a attractive place to go in the warmer months.\n",
      "This is great little pub! We live right down the street and it is our go to spot. I have have had a bunch of different things on the menu. In the summer my favorite is the roasted sweet corn ceasar salad. My fiance loves the ruben. The turkey sandwhich is really good too - I think it is perfect as is, but my fiance thinks it's a little dry so he adds mayo. I love the atmosphere the most, it's cozy in the winter and has plenty of outside seating right on the square for summer. We always get great service and the food is great, we get it to-go on weeknights sometimes too!\n",
      "Great beer selection The draft choices are always thoughtful-- good variation without being overwhelming. Good food-- the frites and burger are delicious. And the hummus is good-- I think its changed over the past year, and I wish they'd bring back the old stuff! Always crowded-- and yet, not impossible to get a table for two. Have watched a couple Badger games here over dinner, and Cooper's affords a compromise between junky-sportsbar-eating-basket-fries and one-tiny-television-in-a-nice-restaurant.\n",
      "I was very happy with this place after picking up the wife from the airport and the Old Fashioned was booked for an hour or more. This place was recommended by one of the hosts of Harvest which is right next to the Old Fashioned, We didn't go because it was a little too upscale for coming from the airport. This place was great, the waiter/server gave us good insights on the popular items. Do not pass up the frenched chicken. Yeah it's a chicken dish and it's worth ordering. My wife ordered the chicken and I order the pork belly mac, pretty awesome, you need that mac to cut through the richness of the pork belly. I was up north in Wisconsin past spring green earlier that week and I recognized a few of the farms and creameries they source ingredients from because I had a chance to visit and buy some stuff from them. One of the managers was very friendly and checked on us a couple times and even stopped to have a conversation with us about moving out to the country and how he someone will get dragged up there with his boyfriend. Paraphrasing of course... Anyways.. I recommend visiting when you are in the square. Btw they have cool ceiling fans.\n",
      "Cooper's is very hip, with a great beer selection and gastronomic food. Well, let's qualify the food statement...I had the Mac and cheese with pork belly, which sounded phenomenal on paper, but in actuality was a bit disappointing. The pork belly--it sounded wrong to begin with, but I thought \"OK it could be brilliant\"--was really at odds with the mac. AND my mac'n'cheese is way better. BUT, that being said...Coop's is a way-cool place to hang out. :\n",
      "I wanted to like this place. I really really did. We decided to visit after seeing that they had a unique take on different meals. The service was okay and the prices were decent. The restaurant was very packed and a bit on the \"packed like sardines\" side. The food was again just okay but I really expected more. The beer selection was great. Unfortunately, the deal breaker would be the mild food poisoning that the two out of the 3 of us received. The other guest received a pretty bad case of it (they ordered the fish and chips fyi) My suggestion would be to stick with the beer or not go at all.\n",
      "Went to this restaurant on the day after thanksgiving when all of our first choices were closed. We got in, and while seated right away, took 15 minutes and us asking the waitress 3 times before we even got water. The couple that came in 30 min after us got food and drinks before us. The service was poor, and slow. The food was just okay. Edited on 3/11/12 - gave it a second chance - raised it to 3 stars instead of two. This time is was much, much better service, but still 'good/okay' food. I do have to say, I was more impressed with the beer list this time. I'd consider going again for drinks.\n",
      "Loved Coopers! So incredibly lucky to stumble upon this place our very first night in Madison for work! So incredibly sad for everywhere we've eaten after Coopers since they just can't compete with our experience there. I have to admit I was hesitant about the food we would encounter in Madison (sorry but I've spent a lot of time in the Midwest and usually end up bloated and searching for greens/veggies/roughage). Coopers totally blew me away with its perfect blend of pub/comfort food faves, locavore love, and the best things about Midwestern food (its true roots). By the time I left I was wondering why we can't have a Coopers in our town! My meal was a delicious bavarian beef stew with German dumplings, REAL German dumplings for those who love them, artisan beer and brussels sprouts. The plate was so big, I cannot believe I ate the whole thing but it was sooooo good. And did mention this is a regular menu item, not a special? Their drink menu, including a nice and reasonably priced selection of wines by the glass, specialty cocktails, and an astonishing selection of beers, is impressive! And the staff was awesome! You know where I'll be eating when I'm back in Madison next week.\n",
      "This is the best place in Vegas to get real Italian pizza. Service is always great and the food never fails. Love it love it love it!\n",
      "My first time in here the service was outstanding very quick very attentive give me a great suggestion when a warm beet salad as I wanted to eat clean. I ordered the Quattro pizza with extra mozzarella which came to me quickly tasted very good and I was pleased with the overall meal. I came earlier right around 11 so it was wide open with great service.\n",
      "When I first tried this place I was very surprised about the style of pizza because I had never tried it before! But I absolute love it. It's not like the pizza you can get from Pizza Hut so be ready but you won't be disappointed. I had the white asparagus pizza and it was amazing! I came in on a Saturday night and I had Bethanie she was very quick and super attentive! She has really good customer service and that's the most important part other than the food of course! I will definitely be back\n",
      "The dough (crust) comes out burned/charred. I am OK with the tasteless tomato sauce some people mention, I actually like sauce like that. Some other pizzerias just add too many spices in the sauce and I don't like it. But why, or why? Why do you burn the crust like that. Please, don't tell me that's how oven baked or wood fired pizza should be. I've tried them all and the crust should NOT be so burned. Check out my photos. It was so bad, my kids did not want to eat the pizza, in the end they ate only the mid secrion of it. The pizza is very thin. The sauce and cheese are light. Toppings tasted good. These are all food things. That's why I give it 2 stars. Other bad things - other parts of the pizza were slightly burned as well and the toppings were unevenly spread. Please, fix your ovens or replace them.\n",
      "Meh...it was okay. Nothing bad on their part...their style of pizza is just not my cup of tea. I prefer a thicker crust. Not bad. Just not the best pizza I've had in my life...I likely will not be going out of my way for a follow-up visit but if a group of friends wanted to visit again, I wouldn't be opposed.\n",
      "Warm Beets ($8.50): Roasted golden and red beets, goat cheese crema, roasted garlic, dill, olive oil, and Marcona almonds. Wonderful antipasti dish! The beets were lovely. I was really pleased with the goat cheese crema as it was a modest amount and didn't dare overpower the beautiful beets. The almonds were a nice touch! Polpette Napoletane ($14): Neapolitan beef and pork meatballs, covered in Neapolitan tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil. The meatballs were simple and just loaded with meat and practically no filler. It's served with buttered toast that's been tossed into the oven as well; delicious. Margherita DOC ($14): Crushed tomato, mozzarella di bufala, parmigiano, and basil. This is one of my all-time favorite pizza styles and this is definitely one I'd want again. The dough and all the components created a solid Napoletana pizza. They also have a non-DOC option without buffalo mozzarella for $12. Pizza Carbonara ($13): Crushed tomato, panchetta, egg, cracked pepper, parmigiano, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil. All of their pizzas start the same way, so it's the same great crust/dough. My disappointment with this pizza was the scarcity of toppings and the cooked yolk - that's definitely not what I was expecting. Since this is atypical for Carbonara, I think it should be disclosed on the menu or as you order. The restaurant is beautiful and the vibe is classy yet casual. I love that everything cooked is thrown into the blistering-hot brick oven. I also like the non-pizza offerings and look forward to trying several of those as well. There is a happy hour during the week (M-Th 3-6PM, 8-9PM & F 3-6PM, 8:30-10PM) with most selections at $5/each.\n",
      "Really good pizza and salad for the price. They think they are fancy with their wine list. It is not that good of a wine list and my wife had a sparkling wine served in a red wine glass...yeah. Half of it was wasted on the pour. Stick with beer here.\n",
      "The Good: Our server was really nice and attentive as well as everyone else who helped her out. The Bad: Everything lacked flavor from start to finish. Our app the Bruschetta was horrible, from the taste and texture to the balsamic that was \"artistically\" swirled in the center. The pizza I ordered which was the Vico didn't have enough toppings...basically a white pizza with horrible inconsistent cuts of onions, and maybe a toddlers handful of meat...no joke! The meat on the pizza was less than 1/4 of a cup. The canoli was by far the worst canoli I've ever had. Paula Dean couldn't even save this dish. The Worst: Both pizzas were under cooked. Either the chef really didn't care because we walked in 35 minutes before close or because a group of 6+ walked in 20 minutes before close or because he was too occupied making sure what looked like his family was having a better meal than anyone else. I see and hear people rave about this place. Regardless of the friendly waitstaff, I wouldn't return due lack of flavor, lack of originality and inability to make something so simple as pizza cook properly.\n",
      "Pros: Server was amazing Super clean Fast and hot Smells amazing Crushed Ice!!!! Cons: Awful Pizza $19 for a small pizza with one topping Greasy and Soggy They don't have pepperoni ...just salami No lunch specials\n",
      "One of the nice things about running a half marathon is that afterwards, you can eat anything you want. So after burning what I tell myself must have been AT LEAST a million and a half calories in the Rock 'n' Roll, I told my parentals that it was critical we get pizza. Serious. Crucial. Muy importante. We rolled in to the new location of Settebello and the place is an Instagrammer's dream. It has a very refined, elegant feel to it that does not exude \"pizzeria\" in the slightest bit. Tons of #nofilter #woodwork #crafty #ilovepizza #canyoubelievethisisapizzaplace #noireallycant going on. La noche began with fried risotto, which were ravioli-like envelopes of breaded risotto, and a beet salad with creamy goat cheese and nuts. I think the risotto could have stood on its own without making a detour to the fryer, but the salad was a fresh complement to the pizza. The Family K opted for the Vico (sausage, fennel, onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil) and Capriccioso (all vegetables - don't even bother if you're a carnivore), and the final tally had Vico in the lead. We were advised in advance that the thin-crust pizzas come out slightly charred, but the crust on our Capriccioso was just burnt, which is why it was Michelle Kwan that night and not Tara Lipinski. We learned that night that crushed tomato is OKAYYY but we don't love it. Since Settebello has so many options without crushed tomatoes though, I'm sure we will be back again sometime to peruse the other items on the menu. #nexttimeiwonthavejustrunahalfmarathonthoughughhh\n",
      "Hands down the best service I've ever received in a restaurant. I love to go out to eat and I have also lived in Las Vegas for 6 years and have been to hundreds of places here. Our server was incredibly professional. She knew the menu completely, made some great suggestions, perfectly timed our appetizers, salads, and entrees, and really made our meal a great experience. We were offered the private room in the back because it was just me and a lady friend, it was windowed with a glass door and very quiet. We were able to have nice conversation without having to talk over other patrons back there. We ordered a misto plate which had. A variety of Italian meats, cheese, and grilled veggies with focaccia bread. The server suggested a salad with just greens, balsamic, and shaved Parmesan. Perfect! My friend ordered a mini margarita pizza because it was available at happy hour price at only $5! I ordered a 12\" full sized Diavola pizza because I was hungry. The pizza was soft and fluffy. The salami was spicy but not overbearing. My server brought out some pepper flake infused olive oil to put on the pizza and it really added an extra kick. On top of this, we each had a drink and our check came out under $50! Truly the best experience I've had anywhere here and it's a great place to take a date. Go there now!!\n",
      "OMG people would you stop acting all knowing about food and this is real Italian pizza and all that crap. It's dry it's boring it's tasteless it's not happy, the whole idea of pizza is gone with this one. There are way better places. And it gets cold in twenty seconds. No good\n",
      "I've really enjoyed this place since it arrived! Cocktails are tasty, decent selection. I've enjoyed the Moscow mule varieties in particular. The salads are a must. Any pizza you get is gonna taste fantastic: customize it and be as happy as you want to be. Good attentive service and open atmosphere with an additional area to sit at the bar. Will continue to be a staple!\n",
      "The food is delicious! If I was just judging the quality of food and flavored this review would be very different... That being said the service is awful. So inattentive and unapologetic it's hard to want to go back for the delicious pizzas. An early dinner with friends turned into a two and a half hour debacle of some of the worst service I've ever had. Order to go, and enjoy the meal in your own home. Or make sure when you go you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint.\n",
      "I love Settebello! Napoli style pizza rocks my socks off! Get the Diavola pizza if you like spicy! Mmmm\n",
      "This place was very unique. I had the Margarita Pizza. It was pretty good. The ambience and location next to the movie theater was great. I would recommend this place for a nice dinner.\n",
      "Awesome place! Closest thing to Neapolitan pizza around and real Mozzarella de Buffalo! Yum\n",
      "Overall this place is just plain and just OK. The atmosphere is good, the service was good, but the food is sub-par. I imagine it's fine for happy hour but otherwise I don't think the pizza and salad is good.\n",
      "I struggled between giving this place 3 or 4 stars....the food was hands down a five star rating Caprese salad was amazing ( wish it was bigger) Margherita pizza on point Pizza of the week solo carne well made...should be added to the menu permanently If you like your crust more firm you should ask for it on the well done side Service on the other hand... We were greeted by the most friendly hostess I've ever seen in a restaurant...she too deserves 5 stars They were busy but we were seated in less than 5 minutes Our waitress was nice too just really busy and to be fair our experience didn't go south until the end...we finished our pizza and I wanted coffee and dessert. We ordered tiramisu and Nutella pizza and 2 cappuccinos...when waiting a very large party can in and they sat next to us...not really a big deal but we did have to move our table down a little for comfort. Our waitress was given the big table as well as needed to finish ours. We were delivered our desserts but coffees were no were to be found and she kept going back to the big table to take orders while we clearly sat at our table ready to go.she finally dropped the check with no mention of the coffee....until My husband mentioned it to her. She was nice and apologized but said well they aren't on the bill so that's good...yeah I guess it is good. I just felt like our table was no longer important now that a table of 25 was there...my bill was still $100 and I still tipped her 20% so I feel I was important too. Just food for thought...and yes we will be back because the food is the bomb!\n",
      "This place is great. I ordered a starter of bruschetta, which looked amazing. The crispy pancetta on the top was a nice touch; however the toast points were lacking in flavor and texture, and possibly freshness. I would have appreciated it more if it were served with fresh, toasted (possibly in their Italian oven?!) bread rubbed with garlic or olive oil. The pizza was dynamite and could not be improved upon. I had a margherita, and my husband had a Diavolo. My son ordered a smaller cheese children's pizza - nice to have a kid option. Service was good. Decorated nicely. Next time I'll take care to wear something better than shorts and flip flops.\n",
      "Settebello is pretty successful as an upscale, woodfire pizzeria. Service was excellent; friendly and prompt. Had a simple pizza with fresh mozzarella, spicy salami, and basil; very tasty. I typically order pepperoni pizza, but loved the salami. Makes pepperoni seem a little humdrum. I liked the crushed tomatoes approach to the sauce, but I wish Settebello would rethink how much tomato juice they are allowing on the crust; I think they could stay true to their concept of pizza without letting it get overly soggy.\n",
      "It was a family night and I've been dying to try Settebello for the longest time and it just so happened I saw that there was one close to us. Away we went and we walked in and they had said they couldn't take credit card at that moment but luckily we had enough cash money to pay for the tab. We started off with the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto. It came with a pizza size bread type thing as well which was a little burnt. The mozzarella was delish and it went well with everything. I ordered the Bianca. I wasn't too impressed with it and since it was such a thin crust it got soggy pretty quickly. My husband ordered the Capricciosa. We weren't blown away by that either. Overall service wasn't the quickest and most attentive (waited for more napkins for a good 10 minutes or so) but the credit card machine was back in working order. I wasn't too impressed and I'm not sure I'll be back when there's a lot of pizza places that I do love around! Sorry Settebello!\n",
      "I obsess over their diavolo pizza - it is absolutely delicious! The panzanella salad is great too. The only thing I have had here that I was not happy with was the brisket pizza.\n",
      "Authentic Italian - doesn't get better than this. I highly recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "The worse pizza I have ever had hands down. Dough taste like a tortilla no flavor on pizzas at all. And maybe it's just me but I'd never have canned tomatoes and bags for flour as a display in any restaurant I work in. The one star is for the warm beats those were not bad teach the cooks to season better and they'd be good\n",
      "Went into little lunch there today had a horrible service we did at least a good 10 minutes until someone greeted our table it was completely dead nail drops and the server finally came Got our drinks didn't come back for another 10 minutes to take our order. The pizza was limp and not crispy all the way through.....so u can understand when u grab a piece and everything falls off because the center is not cooked all the way....my salad that came out first had line pine nuts that I asked to take off still came to the table with them....had to remake the salad and our pizza took about 20 min to come out. Clearly the girl during the day that was working should take a pen and paper to the table for orders. The place was dirty and should be closed down for horrible food and service!!! Work on that and maybe you have a chance!\n",
      "I'd never been before but a friend constantly raves about the place so when visiting this time, we made this the final gathering place for the trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful and saw to it that we got a great seat for our party of 10. First stop? The bar while waiting for the rest to arrive. The wine list is somewhat limited with only a few whites by the glass. Fortunately my favorite white was on the list. Pinot Grigio. It was nice and dry, not sweet, with a fruity linger. Very good stuff. The server in the bar was friendly and when he asked us if we wanted \"water\" I knew immediately he wasn't from Las Vegas. I pegged him from New York. Brooklyn even. He told us he was from Brooklyn so I asked him to say water again just so I could hear it. Where I come from when you say water, you're speaking a different language. As our party arrived and we moved into the main dining area, we were promptly seated without a reservation. They were very accommodating and friendly. Service was impeccable and she provided a nice flow to the whole situation. If I could give just the server a star rating, it would be 5, no doubt. I started off with another glass of Pinot to go along with my salad. We shared a beet salad and the Insalata Grande, which in my opinion was the better of the two. This might have been one of the best salads I've ever had: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette. Pizza? Yes Pizza. On rare occasions I'm willing to violate my glutard status. We didn't know until after arriving that you have to ask for gluten-free a day in advance because that's what they need to prepare it. I think they're pickier than I. At any rate, we had the Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I think in order to truly enjoy this pizza you have to be a fan of the crust. This stuff was ultra thin and a bit chewy. I'm not saying I didn't like it, I'm just saying you would have to be a fan to truly enjoy it. It's not something you can pick up and bite but something you have to eat with a fork. For a lot of pizza aficionados, that's practically sacrilege. In the end and for me: The dining experience gets 5 stars, the service 5, and the pizza 4. Sooo, I'm going to give it 4 stars because you just have to go and check it out for yourself. Is it yea or nay on the pizza? That's what Settebello is all about, the pizza. I will say here though, that the VPN (Vera Pizza Napoletana) certification is impressive. The requirements are as follows: The VPN charter requires that members use only specific raw ingredients to create the pizza dough, that the dough be worked with the hands, never using a rolling pin and that it be cooked directly on the surface of a bell shaped pizza oven that is fueled solely by wood. The charter also requires specific types of tomatoes be used and only the use of fresh milk or buffalo milk mozzarella is acceptable. Settebello is one of only 5 pizza establishments in the country to be certified by the Napolitana pizza police from Italy. I guess that says a lot.\n",
      "This one star review is based only on the swing bar staff. the food here is great. but ALL of the girls behind the bar are so incompetent it's painful to watch them. if the drink isn't spelled out on a note card they can't make it, makes sense that I've never had the same drink taste the same... for such a wonderfully designed bar, a great bar menu and liquor selection they sure don't give a shit about who's behind the bar and how they train them. would love to hang out there but would rather spend $11 on a cocktail that's made correct some where else\n",
      "I wasn't a pizza lover until I met Settebello. Anyone who knows me knows that pizza is never my go-to option. I am very picky with pizza and having just moved from New York City, I've also had my fair share of pizza tastings but who knew Napoletana was going to be my style? The first time I was here, I feel in love. I immediately came back the next week and brought two friends with me, one who is a pizza lover and will eat any kind of pizza you put in front of him. What I love about Settebello is that this style of pizza features a super thin crust that is loaded with fresh and abundant toppings that is baked fresh in a wood-burning oven. This is definitely true Italian style pizza, not American style or Chicago style or NY Style. If you're expecting this then don't don't come here. The dough is soft and only takes a minute to cook in their wood-burning oven. I found the pizza to be soft and foldable yet at times it would have been easier to eat this with a knife and fork, which by New York standards Is a massive NO-NO. Yet in Italy, this is how they would eat it. The blackened char spots on the pizza crust is a tell-tale sign of Pizza Napoletana that has been cooked in a blistering hot, wood burning oven so don't fret if you see some burnt crust. It's not the end of the world. I'd recommend the DIAVOLA for spicy lovers (Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) and the SETTEBELLO (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) Ciao!\n",
      "Loved this place. Chianti was very nice and smooth. We had the anti pasta plate and everything was very good and very fresh. The Settebello pizza was the best we have had in Henderson. I would recommend.\n",
      "This is my favorite spot in vegas.... Period! Consistently tasty & fresh good ingredients! You can taste the quality. The pizzas are mouth watering and will fulfill any choosy sauce opinionated type, it's more of a \"Fresca\" Napoli style pizzas. I love their warm beet salad with marcona almonds & goat cheese. (On the happy hour menu too) This place is Super great and highly underestimated! They have happy hour too that's definitely worth going those times.\n",
      "With the recommendation of my sister, I tried this place for lunch today. I ordered the Emilia pizza while my beau ordered the Vico. Service was fairly on point and ambience was very casual. It was not busy at all since it was a weekday and so service was quick. The pizzas were good, fresh ingredients and a good size. However, overall it was good, not great. The crust was a little bit softer than I would like and it seemed like it lacked seasoning. Would I come back? probably would but I would try to go to other pizzerias I've had around the area.\n",
      "The service is always the best they always have the best suggestions! The pizza ingredients are always fresh and best quality! Love the margarita pizza have actually finished a few by myself! The sangria is my favorite top it off with a Nutella pizza or the donuts that taste like funnel-cake filled with Nutella and your living the Italian dream!\n",
      "Stellar service, reasonable prices, large portions and the best GF crust EVER. Real pizza. Real Italian.\n",
      "Worst pizza ever had...please don't go waste your money...I did....Their calzone is not good either..It's just flat..Flavors are weird..They just put olives on the pizza without cutting them....I wouldn't even rare it 1 star\n",
      "We arrived at 4pm and found the restaurant in comparative darkness without any customers. The latter actually worked in our favor because we had wonderfully quick service from a very knowledgeable server. We ordered a warm beet appetizer together with arancini ( rice balls ). The warm beets were served in a small cast iron skillet with chopped Italian almonds which were a delight followed by the arancini which were crispy and deliciously warm. So far so good. Then we had 2 pizzas. Mine was a \"bianca\" with just mozzarella arugula and parmigiano but I added basil and Kalamata olives. My husband ordered a basic pizza Margherita. Both pizzas were nicely charred around the edges but the interiors were slightly gummy. Having said this I do think a little longer in the wood fired oven would have been the answer to make the base nicely crispier. The pizzas tasted very pleasant even so . We ordered 3 desserts to get the feel of the menu. A Tiramisu , some zeppole and a gluten free torta chocolate cake. All desserts were delightful but the Nutella free zeppole were the best I have tasted outside of Italy. The bill was around $93 but all things considered, this was indeed value for money due to us ordering far more than most people would even consider eating. An espresso following the meal was excellent and rounded off my early dinner very adequately. I would highly recommend Settebello but suggest an early or late visit because I think this place would be overflowing at normal times to dine. We left here at 6pm and it was filling up quickly. A+++ for this local eatery.\n",
      "FIRE OVEN Grabbed some pizzas from here for lunch & it was AMAZING!! We had to do togo becuase we had people waiting at home for it. The staff was very friendly and frequent in making sure their guests were taken care of. It literally only took 15 minutes for our pizzas to be ready from the moment we placed our orders. We got the pizza of the week with pesto sauce & tomato w/ garlic which I thought was hands down AWSOME! Bianca was another one we got with the balsamic reduction! We got one other pizza but i forgot the name.. The dough was chewy and crispy! So good & you could just tell the cheese was fresh! Definately will be back to try the dining experience more & the pizza would probably taste so much better when it is Hot!\n",
      "Had lunch here for my first time today. Excellent pizza. Perfect portions for two. Fresh ingredients. Atmosphere was great. Will return!\n",
      "All I can say is wow!! This is definitely the best pizza I've EVER had! The atmosphere is very nice and pleasant. The service is great, and the thin crust margherita pizza is absolutely delicious!! I will be coming here a lot more !!\n",
      "You get a 3 because you're service is inconsistent. When Al's there, great, otherwise, Eh. Pizza is great when the Neapolitans are working. Hemingway on the rocks is a delicious cocktail. I've stolen it off you. Thanks.\n",
      "I can not believe that I have found this wonderful Pizzeria! It brought back so many memories of living in Bella Napoli! We had an early lunch and it was not busy at all. My husband has never had the Neapolitan pizza but he loved the flavor. I hate that I have to travel 4 hours by plane to enjoy this .\n",
      "So this pizza was really interesting. Gluten-free pizzas in other restaurants usually taste like really bad microwaved pizzas, but Settebello's recipe was totally different. Their gluten free pizza had like a naan bread base (which is probably just Napoli-style; I have never had it before, though, and that's the closest comparison I can draw!) and fresh ingredients piled on top of it. They're definitely not American pizzas; they have a very authentic Italian taste (especially the sauce). The hostess said pretty much anything on the menu can be made gluten free for just $4 extra, which was incredibly accommodating. My friend and I went at around 5PM on a Sunday, and it wasn't very crowded and service was incredibly quick (the pizzas came around 10 minutes after we ordered). The ambiance was really nice, too; it's very tastefully decorated and would probably make a great date night.\n",
      "Beat pizza I've ever had in Vegas . Truly authentic Italian style , good as the pizza I have in Napoli when I visit my family every year. I truly impressed , the salads are awesome as well ,\n",
      "This is my family spot. Any time someone visits...we're here. A birthday in the family? We're here! Fathers Day? Were Here! Mothers day? bam..here! If you're not into something a little bit different and just want your NY Pie or Chicago deep dish....you need to go across the street. But if you want to get full and eat a delicious Napoletana Pizza...this is your spot. I usually order the Emilia. Italian Creme instead of the tomotoe sauce...prosciutto, cotto, mozarella, that fresh basil....mmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! If I'm in the mood for red sauce...I'll order the Settebello, This is the closest you'll get to tasting real italian pizza...and it's a lot cheaper than airfare. So thankful the summerlin Settebello opened. Now my family doesn't have to travel all the way to the Green Valley District for a taste of Italy.\n",
      "This place was OK. I came here recommended by a friend and brought along 3 other friends. The pizza was mediocre. I can honestly say Metro Pizza has WAY better pizza than this place. Our server was cool, Even though it took him 10 years to get my friend her long island ice tea drink. I was dissapointed when we ordered the bruschetta. It ONLY came with 2 pieces on a HUGE platter and we paid $9 for it. One was bigger than the other and the smaller one was burnt. I don't think it was worth the price but it was still good. The platter it was on looked like it could have came with 4 or 5 pieces total. Wasn't too hyped up about this place. I don't think I'll come back.\n",
      "A nice ambiance, reasonable prices and most importantly for me is a real awareness for the Gluten-free needs of those who request. The only improvement would be service, the servers do a good job but each time I've gone there is simply not enough of them. They don't complain about it but it is noticeable.\n",
      "I LOVE the pizza here. The crust is so fresh along with all of the other ingredients. They make a great Moscow Mule also.\n",
      "A friend and I came across this place hoping to eat something before a movie. The menu looked good and they were able to seat us right away. The decor and the whole vibe was really cool. Our server Juan was very friendly, personable and had good menu knowledge. We ordered a bottle on Kim Crawford which was yummy and started with a caprese salad. It was good but pretty basic. I would have like a bit more basil but I would definitely have it again and maybe ask for a bit of extra basil. We shared a margarita pizza. It was good. A bit doughy for a thin pizza. Too much crust but maybe that appeals to most Americans. But the dessert..... Was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! The tiramisu was the best ive ever had! They also had an espresso machine which we took advantage of! We were able to have a full meal within an hour and fifteen minutes and were able to make our movie on time. I'll be back!\n",
      "Pizza with a twist......and a full bar! Mauriccio from Italia has has the perfect hand for making these pizzas. And the fresh squeezed oj mimosas.....on point\n",
      "had a late dinner with some friends and was very happy with my meal what i ate: - misto (antipasta): meats, vegetables, some cheese, focaccia: the focaccia bread was great, as was the mix of charcuterie and cheese. perfect way to get the appetite going - margherita pizza: a classic margherita. it was just right, and the with the kind of pizza they do here (thin), this was perfect - vico pizza: sausage, fennel, red onion, marscarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil: i also really liked this pizza. the sausage give it a nice smokey meaty flavor, and the onion and fennel gave it that extra umph. - capricciosa pizza: artichoke hearts, roasted mushrooms, olives, mozzarella, basil. basically your veggie pizza, but better. trust me pros: - pizza! really, the food was just great. i really enjoyed all the pizzas and the antipasta - service: she was very helpful and patient with us. we came in an hour before closing, but she didnt rush us at all. she had plenty of suggestions and helped us order for a table of 6 - ambiance/decor: dark wood, mismatched chairs. really nice. great date spot! - bathroom: i know this is really random, but i loved the farmhouse sink in the bathroom. it was just soooo nice to see that the decor was also looked at in the bathroom - plenty of parking in the lot cons: - not any i can think of *tip* there is more than one location, and menu varies would i come again? even though i dont live in LV, yes!\n",
      "Absolutely terrible service. They had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant and even had the buss boy serving. The food was good but the service definitely takes away from it....very understaffed.\n",
      "Absolutely the BEST PIZZA in Las Vegas. This is the way a real pizza should be. I was born and raised in Italy and I know very well my Italian food. I am also a very picky eater and I do not go around giving 5 stars. All their appetizers are wonderful as well, very original and amazing taste. You WON my heart.\n",
      "I go to both locations often. I get the plain Margarita pizza every-time. I've never been disappointed. Service is great at both locations as is the food. Atmosphere at both locations is also very pleasant. There is a special on Monday's at the Summerlin location. $5.00 for a Plain Margarita Pizza (eat in only) It doesn't get better than that.\n",
      "Very casual, no pasta here just pizza and side dishes, salads so you know. Had the Settebelo pizza, very tasty, more than enough for one person. Good service, thanks Samamtha.\n",
      "Great Neapolitan style pizza... Real wood fired pizza, slightly salty flavorful crust, panzanella salad and I love the Italian micro brew selection even if it has changed from the chestnut ale that was to die for!\n",
      "I know I will probably get some heat from my fellow Yelpers for this review, but this was honestly one of the worst meals I have had and I literally had to pull in to the Taco Bell after I left this place to get something to eat because I was so hungry. I went here last night with high hopes. I was in a party of 4 total. We sat in the back room which was kind of like having our own private room, so that was a nice perk. In my party of 4 we did order drinks. The waitress was nice but had no idea about the scotches on the menu and had a really hard time taking this order. She had to go to the bar and bring out 3 or 4 bottles so she could remember what she was doing. We ended up ordering 2 double shots of 2 different kinds of Scotch, 3 beers and a glass of wine. For the appetizer we shared the Arancini. It only came with 2 so each person got like 2 bites. These were absolutely flavorless and the inside was pure mush. The only thing that was in tact was the frozen peas that were barely warm. I should mention that there was a hint of red pepper after taste. The waitress suggested that we order 2 salads, each couple could share. Great- the first couple ordered the Insalata Grande: Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Balsamic Vinaigrette. The second couple ordered the Beet Salad, which had a ton of arugula. few beets, tablespoon of goat cheese and no dressing. he first couple seemed to like the salad just fine. Our salad was not good, it was like eating dried grass without dressing. Before we could even finish our salads, they brought out our pizzas. What??? You couldn't even wait until we finished. Your restaurant was totally dead on a Saturday night. It's not like you needed the table. Why the rush? Back to the pizzas. We each order our own because the waitress said they were very small and we could all eat a whole one. We ordered 2 Margherita DOC: Crushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Vico (No Crushed Tomatoes): Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and 1 with salami and cheese (they do not have pepperoni here and will give you salami if you order it). Everyone started to dig in on the pizzas and all looked at each other like what the hell is this? The first couple were so hungry that they went ahead and ate theirs. The BF hesitated to eat his and I could no way eat another bite. This was the worst COLD pizza I have ever had. We waited for the waitress that did not come back for a while. The BF was so hungry he decided to go ahead and eat his but did not like it at all. When the waitress finally showed back up I told her this was the most flavorless, disgusting cold pizza I have ever had. It also looked liked someone had poured a cup of water in the middle of it. The waitress informed me that Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella is a watery cheese. LOL!! Oh and let me also say that all of the pizzas were burned (like charred black on the bottom). Yes--I know these are cooked in a brick oven but burnt is burnt people. So as I am telling the waitress how much I hated this pizza, she is making up a to go box. I am trying to hand her my pizza to get rid of it and she asked me if I would like to take it home. WHAT?? Did you even listen to what I just said? WAKE UP!! No I don't want this nasty pizza now and I certainly am not going to want it at home. She took it away and when she walked in to the kitchen she must have said something because everyone that was standing back there all turned around at once staring at me. RUDE!! She came back a few minutes later and said the manager was at the store but would take it off my check when he returned. I was surprised that the manager never came to my table to apologize or offer me something else. So our check came and it was $166. Wow--that is outrageous for the quality of food we were just served. I have no problem paying for meals that are good and worth it. This was just plain gross. If the other people in our group weren't starving, they would have also sent back their pizzas. Yes I am aware that this is a VPN certified restaurant. Just because you have the certificate does not mean you have good pizza. It is basically a marketing tool. For those that don't know the definition of VPN, it is as follows: \"VPN\" is a designation given to qualifying pizzerias by the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana or its delegates To qualify you must: Make its pies with only certain types of ingredients Use only approved equipment Adhere to traditional pizza-making methods There are parameters on: Oven temperature How long the pizza is allowed to cook What size and shape the final product should be Final note is that I have spent many many months in Italy (all over). I am well aware of how this food should taste.\n",
      "The pizza is awesome. I've eaten at both location and I like the atmosphere at this one better. They have a great drink menu also and the service was fantastic.\n",
      "If you have been to Italy one taste of this magnificent pizza will wisk you back there instantly. True attention to detail allows for a pizza experience. Pizza Hut it ain't... try it you'll love it!\n",
      "Finally made it out here for happy hour, celebrating the end of the school year! Surprised to see that they only had one other table during our visit, so service was fast. Ordered a Dogfishhead IPA ($3 off during HH), and each of the following dishes for a mere $5 each: bruschetta appetizer, warm beets \"snack\", and the Margherita and Vico mini pizzas. For $25 before tip, this was a filling but light early dinner. The apps were delish: bruschetta is my BF's favorite, and here the crostini is topped with bacon and there's a side of pesto for extra flavor, too. The warm beets were divine and flavorful, served in a mini cast-iron dish and topped with peanuts. The mini pizzas weren't that mini- don't know the size compares with their usual since this was our first visit, but server let us know that the usual pizzas are 12\" and intended to be an individual size due to the thinness of the crust style. Ordering two mini pizzas (maybe 8\"?) was enough for us to share without feeling like we were going to explode afterward. Margherita style was my favorite, as the classic tomato-and-cheese combo is just what I naturally crave when I think of pizza, and I love the complementary flavors of fresh basil. BF preferred the Vico, with sausage, fennel, mozzarella, moscarpone, and red onions- quality ingredients and good depth of flavor. While he liked this topping combination better, my dude simply didn't love the thin, wet crust style served here and it may be tricky to get him back in. Will be coming back soon to try the Moscow Mule cocktail and the Emilia pizza- possibly on my own!\n",
      "Perfection and simplicity. This pizza is exactly what I had in Napoli, Italy years before. The crust is thin and chewy flavored with the wood-fired oven. The red sauce is also wonderful, light and tangy, they must use fresh tomatoes as it does that have the strong \"tomato paste\" flavor as many other pizzerias have. Go and enjoy true Napoli style pizza. Does not disappoint.\n",
      "My wife and I frequent Settebello because of it's close proximity to our office and the exceptional food/service we've received in the past. However, today was not one of those days. We arrived begore the typical lunch rush at noon and were seated. The new waitres was obviously frazzled already. We oredered our usual lunch special - two pizzas and two salads for $22. The new girl then informed us we could not order what we wanted, even after we assured her that we would pay the difference for the additional toppings like we have everytime in the past. She got offended and told us the other girl (the usual waitress that has served us for the last year or so) was fired and that ot was because of people like us modifying our order. We decided to stay and order the special and the side salads since we had already been served our drinks. Our salads finally came, but by this time several other people had shown up for lunch. She must have been the only person hosting and waiting tables as it was pretty hard to get her attention. Our pizza came out of the oven and sat on the counter for several mintues before she came out of the back and finally cut it and brought it to our table. Sadly it was now cold, but had the promise of being a pretty tasty pizza. When we asked to settle up for the salad and drinks, and told her our pizza was cold she proceeded to walk over to the manager and tell him we didn't like the pizza and so the very nice man came over and gave us a free pizza coupon for our next visit. (But to be clear, no we actually thought the flavor was good, but eating a cold pizza was not to be desired and trying to flag down this waitress was very difficult). All in all kudos to the manager, he obviously cares about his customers, especially ones that come almost once a week. I guess the other girl who used to work there was fired for being nice and accommodating to her customer, who knows, I can only go by what the new waitress told us (who even says stuff like that to customers? ) but I can tell you that the service was terrible\n",
      "First time here and will definitely return! Pizza is thin crust. Not greasy like some other chain pizza joints. Nice atmosphere for a date but can also be family friendly. Best part was the cannoli! Yummy!\n",
      "Came here a second time to have dinner with a group of friends and the experience was much better. I ordered the Emila Pizza again but this time they said they couldn't add because ot was an Italian restaurant and they don't make chicken?? Either way, it is still the best pizza I've had! And of course the cannolis are to die for.\n",
      "Cool decor, the service wasn't really good for start we order just water and soda but my friend ordered a beer in a wine glass (she is very picky) our server said there was a problem with the beer and he will get as soon as possible. About 10 minutes later we forgot who our server was. Finally the beer came but not in a bear glass not a wine glass. The food made up for that though it was really fresh and tasty.\n",
      "The food is great and the staff are very friendly, funny, & helpful. Totally my new favorite!\n",
      "This place has an excellent atmosphere, clean floors/tables, great service and perfect pizza. The variety is the key because you can just keep coming back and experimenting with all the unique combinations. Personally I like the jalapeño and the margarita. Don't forget to save some room for the tiramisu. This is a great spot for a date, group of friends or the whole family. I felt like I was at home as soon as I walked in and was greeted promptly. The place is upscale quality with reasonable pricing which always makes me happy. Also the portions were hearty and not skimpy and you can tell that the meat was fresh and well prepped and not just thrown on at the last minuet like most pizzerias are doing these days... Overall I just had to give a five because the place is so well rounded and after multiple visits the consistency in quality really won me over.\n",
      "With all the fantastic pizza places here, I can't help but base my rating off ratings I've given to other pizza spots. This was our first visit to this location and my rating is probably closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I didn't think our experience was worth 4 stars. We were seated quickly and ordered the meatballs and capricciosa pizza. The meatballs were just ok, a little bland without the sauce, but the bread that accompanied it was good. In theory I liked all of the ingredients in the pizza - artichoke, prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, mozzarella, basil. What's not to like? But together, it didn't really work. I think if they used black olives instead of kalamata and chopped the artichoke hearts a bit smaller (instead of huge chunks), and added more mushrooms and prosciutto, it would've been 10 times better. I do like the thin crust and cooking it in a wood fired oven gives it a rustic flavor. Service was decent, not great, not terrible. We probably won't be going back anytime soon though :/\n",
      "I have been wanting to try this place out since I read an article in forbes magazine that setebello is one of the best places for pizza in the US. We've tried a lot of Pizza places in Las Vegas Dom De Marco's was good, but when we tried the setebello this place hands down has the best pizza in town. Thin crust with great selection on fillings. We did try their happy hour and their selection was great. We will definitely come back and try the other selections of pizza.\n",
      "Customer service was great, the specialty pizza was had a good crust flavor and texture was what i expected, but the meatballs i ordered were hot on the out side, cold in the middle and very the fried risotto and sauce it came with was very bland and not propperly seasoned... so i doubt i will go back... for $50 pizza meal for two i believe pizza rock is a better choice.\n",
      "Wow! Where to start? Yum, yum and more Yum! Talk about real Italian food and amazing pizza, this is the place you want to visit! Try their happy hour pizza specials and appetizers from 3-6 I think! Amazing food, quality fresh ingredients that make your mouth water in anticipation! Staff is always friendly and the location is clean and very inviting. Can't wait to come back!\n",
      "I really loved the Henderson location so I wanted to try this new one on Sahara today w/ my mom as my treat for late Mother's Day...service was 5 stars; the 2 servers were very accommodating and attentive. We had 2 kinds of pizza: settebello and the vico one; I actually ended up loving the vico one more, it was a white pizza, the red onions paired well w/ the super creamy cheese. The one star off is for the settebello pizza; it was pretty good too except I felt like the marinara sauce was a bit too acidic and there was too much sauce on this pizza.\n",
      "visited Settebello yesterday for a to-go lunch order. I went with the \"settebello\" pizza ($13.50) - sausage, pancetta, mushrooms and pine nuts. After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few \"artisan\" sodas. Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way. I felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust, The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom.. Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta. I'm hoping this is simply a \" working out the kinks\" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ??? I'll return\n",
      "Just as good as the green valley location, but not as busy for some reason (at least the five times I've been, no wait, plenty of open tables). The location is more spacious and comfortable. The pizza is to die for. I believe it is the best pizza in Las Vegas hands down. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a big favor and give it a shot. You won't regret it.\n",
      "First off the place is beautiful! Its brand new, modern, but also rustickly charming. The menu has more options than Settebello Green Valley. Although Christy, the manager over all the settebellos, said that the Green Valley location would soon be adding the new menu. I love their food! It is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. I lived in Italy for 2 years and at the really nice pizzerias in Italy, this is how the food tastes. Here are my favorite dishes. The insalata Grande, the beet salad, the crustini con crudo, and my favorite pizza is the settebello. Their desserts are out of this world! My favorites are the Nutella pizza, the s'mores calzone , and they have this salt caramel pudding with an armaretto cookie. That armaretto cookie when it comes fresh out of the oven is one of the best things I've ever tasted. If you love real Italian pizza and real Italian food then you will love this restaurant.\n",
      "Best authentic Italian-style pizza in Vegas. Real wood-burning oven. My native Italian friends and I are regulars. Love the decor, especially the bathrooms!\n",
      "I love this place. Great pizza, great authentic rustic Italian food. My favorite pizza is the Diavolo, nice and spicy. The decor is simple urban casual The best part, the service. Matt and Trisha were just so nice, humble people that know what they're doing behind the bar. Cheers!\n",
      "Absolutely terrible. The hostess said the wait would be 30 minutes. After 40 minutes I decided to check on how many people were left ahead of us. My group didn't want to wait much longer. The hostess looked up my name and said two tables in front of us. 25 more minutes go by and I see three more groups seated. Go check to see why we were skipped and then told there are FIVE more in front of you. I explained what the other hostess told me. No apology. Just a shoulder shrug. So the originally quoted 30 minute wait, would've been at least an hour and a half if we kept waiting. I gave up just after an hour. Had I been told the truth of 8(!) more tables in front of us I would've only wasted half the time. Either the hostesses intentionally lie or they can't count or estimate.\n",
      "Since opening a couple weeks ago, we have eaten here 5 times already. Love this type of pizza and Settabello gets it right. If you are looking for real pizza with quality ingredients then you need to eat here.\n",
      "I was impressed by this pizzeria. This was my first visit to this restaurant and it was for a meeting with a party of 8. We were shown to the private room that was a bit tight for our group but luckily we all enjoy each other's company and didn't mind the closeness. The chairs were put together with no space between, so anyone with a big party BEWARE. The food was all delicious, they kept our drinks filled and sold us on dessert. Of everything, the risotto balls were the best appetizer, we didn't have a single bad pizza but the Blanca special was very delicious, and you can never go wrong with Nutella pizza for dessert. Skip the custard doughnuts.\n",
      "Definitely loved the atmosphere and interior of this restaurant! If I walked into this restaurant, I wouldn't think it would be a place where pizza was served. I would recommend this place for couples and or family dinners. Unfortunately, I did not really enjoy the food. We ordered the settebello and carbonara pizzas and it was just alright. You can definitely taste the difference between their pizza and a regular pizza from papa john's, I'll give them that, but I wasn't in love with it. We also ordered the cannoli and it was meh.\n",
      "Settebello is has a cool vibe and great ambiance. They are tucked away inside the Village Square where the movie theater is. It a small restaurant with maybe a 10 seat bar and you can see the brick oven right when you come in. They have a small menu. They have some random salads and even some yummy desserts but I was there for the pizza. My friend found this place when she first started dating her current bae. She pushed me to come and said its the best pizza she has had aside from Italy. It is different from your normal Pizza hut or Domino's. It's thin and toasty. I like the Diavola. It has crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell peppers, crushed red peppers, garlic, mozzarella, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I put a little extra crushed red peppers and each the whole thing... Keep in mind it's thin. I feel like I'm eating two regular slices of pizza. They also have some nutella based dessert which are a must try at least once. We had zeppole for best friend's birthday and they made them a little different since she doesn't like nutella. They made them will the nutella on the side and added cinnamon which was really cool of them to do to. We have been a few times now and I think best friend is right. They hire pretty people. All of them are pretty. It's a random thing to say but when they don't know how to get ice off a table it kind of makes me laugh. We had a little accident and split a yummy Mint Collins. It took a couple trips to get it cleaned up then someone put our new napkins right in the wet spot. They also dropped some of the drink on my phone and didn't apologize or even acknowledge it. It was more funny than anything but they were so busy for the anniversary I was just ready for my $1 pizza. Overall its a great place to grab a pizza and sit and talk with friends. The flavors in the pizza are great and different from the rest.\n",
      "I have a softspot for Settebello & I'm really not sure why. My guess is that it stems from wanting to be one of those people who've found a pizza that blew them away. Settebello did that for me. My favorites: caprese (keep that plate for your pizza to get ever drop of the oil & balsamic left behind), arancini, Settebello specialty pizza (sans pine nuts) & the z... I forget what they're called... the fried dough balls with nutella. The only time I didn't love my pizza was when we got one that had eggplant, hoping it would be like the slices of sauteed eggplant that melted in our mouths at Custom Built Pizza. Instead, it was in cubes & seemed raw/tough still. The ambiance is quite lovely- dark wood, very lodge feeling, yet open & light during the day & rustic romantic at nite. The service is satisfactory- they pay the right amount of attention & give feedback about the menu items, which I like.\n",
      "Ambiance: A Food: A Service: D- If you are looking for one tasty pizza Settobello just may be your place. I dined here for the second time this past weekend and once again, while the food was superb the service is UTTERLY LACKING (which can ruin an otherwise great mean in my book.) Myself and five friends gathered for a post-New Year's dinner. We gave the server our entire order and our waters and iced teas made their way to the table. About this time the fire alarm went off... and continued to go off. Finally they asked everyone inside the restaurant to wait outside while they investigated further (kudos to them... I loved that they took this seriously and put guest safety first.) After about 15 minutes out in the cold Las Vegas night we were allowed to come back inside. The server came back to the table and basically said, \"I can't find your order and will need to put it back into the computer.\" Umm, okay, no big deal. Though we found it strange that no one ever came by to address the fire alarm or simply say \"thanks so much for waiting outside, we know it's cold and really appreciate it\" or \"hey, it was a false alarm, fire department came and checked everything out... thanks for waiting.\" No, it was simply business as usual without one word about the incident. A few minutes 5 of us receive our food... the 6th persons order is lost. Again, no big deal since we have ordered a ton of food and we all prefer family style anyway. About a quarter of the way through our meal one of the servers is trying to stock the shelf LOCATED ABOUT 2 INCHES from three of my friends (on the opposite side of the table) and continually asks my friends to please move so she can complete her side-work. This is where they completely lose me. Here we are, trying to enjoy our meal and we are being asked to constantly move/stand-up/shuffle our chairs so the server can complete her re-stocking of pizza boxes behind us??? We then ask for refills on all six of our drinks since NO ONE has re-addressed this since we originally sat down - and what really infuriated me the most about this particular incident is that there were SIX employees standing at the POS terminal chatting to one another! I'm sorry, but as a manager I'm like HELL NO! Either get to work or go home!! In the end we paid our bill and gave 20% tip because our original server was somewhat decent. But we did ask to speak to the General Manager about the evening. A lady greeted us a few minutes later... we told our story and she said \"I completely understand and I would feel the same way, but I'm just the bar manager......\" In a nutshell, Settebello PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE focus on training and management of your employees. You serve a fantastic pizza but this was my second experience at your restaurant and both times the service has really let me down (the first time wasn't much better but I was willing to give a second try.)\n",
      "I am from Italy for real. Pizza in Italy is considered an health food because the ingredients are few but fresh and the dough is thin but flavorful. I was never able to find a real Italian pizza in the US before until I tasted Settebello's pizza when I moved to Las Vegas. I say this after living in New York City which many claim has great pizza (I'm not one of them). If you're looking for American-style pizza with lots of toppings and fat, Settebello is not for you. If you're looking for an Italian pizza where ingredients are fresh, Settebello is for you. La migliore pizza a Vegas!\n",
      "RATING: B + SERVICE: B - AMBIANCE: A OVERVIEW: Overall the food was delicious, and the ambience is like no other. Definitely a great spot to take someone to dinner. Has a cozy feel to it. The Settebello pizza is something to look out for in the menu. Packed with amazing flavors, and to top it off it was very filling.\n",
      "The new Settebello Pizzeria Napoleotana in Las Vegas is a well-designed, intimate restaurant with beautiful wood and brick furnishings. It feels much more authentic than the Henderson location and we appreciate how closer it is for us to eat here since we live in Las Vegas. When my girlfriend and I walked in at about 3:00pm on a Friday, it was completely empty so we got seated right away with the table/booth of our choice. Originally, our decision to come to the new Settebello was because of the happy hour that they offered from 3pm-6pm, however, there were only a few items on the menu that catered to a real happy hour deal. The beer/wine/cocktails were $2.00 off the original price as well as a \"Mini Bite\" selection that went for $5.00. It wasn't a very good happy hour, but if you're ever planning to go here between 3pm-6pm, maybe you can take advantage of the happy hour menu and knock a few dollars off your bill. For drinks, I originally ordered their Mirror Pond Pale Ale on draft but soon found out that their tap wasn't working for it. Instead, the bartender recommended the Le Freak Imperial IPA by Green Flash and it was delicious. I was impressed that our waitress went out of her way to ask for a similar beer. As an appetizer, we started off with the Piatto Misto which was part of the $5 Mini Bite Menu for HH and consisted of various cheeses and meats served with toasted, warm focaccia bread. It was good for the price. For entrées, I asked what pizza was closest to a meat lovers and the waitress recommended the signature Settebello pizza. My girlfriend ordered the Margherita D.O.C. pizza for her main meal. Both our pizzas came out in a reasonable time (~15 minutes) and looked absolutely stunning. The Margherita D.O.C. displayed what a pizza would look like in Naples and my Settebello order smelled delicious and was nothing short of authentic. The crust on my pizza was perfect: crisp on the edges while soft but still structured towards the center. The toppings were outstanding and the amount was enough to fill me up. I did get a chance to try the Margherita D.O.C. pizza and it was such a velvety, melt-in-your-mouth experience that I may have to get that the next time we visit this place. Overall, the experience here at Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana was fantastic. We have been to the other location in Henderson but the newly opened branch served as a much better experience for us. The only reason I knocked off one star was because of the limited happy hour menu, but honestly, if I could rate this place a 4.5, I totally would. From the interior to the service and all the way to our pizzas, Settebello at The Lakes can be seen as one of our new, favorite pizza places here in town. Bill Breakdown: (with HH) Beer: $7 Settebello: $13 Margherita D.O.C.: $12 Piatta Misto: $5 Total: ~$50.00 w/ tip.\n",
      "Sad to give this 1 star review. I have dined at the Henderson location and loved it. I do live right behind the summerlin location so I thought ordering 2 pies to go was a great idea. Wrong! Crust was burnt and the center of the pie was super greasy and full of water? I returned the pies and watched the cook remake the pizzas his expression on his face was not pleased to make the pies again. Not only because I have been a chef in Las Vegas for 20 years but I could feel the heat blasting all the way by the counter. They need to learn how to control there fire. Burnt is not cooked!!!!! I expressed my concern that the thermostat on the pizza oven was passed 900 degrees and he said well the thermostat had been broken for years. Right then I knew my pizzas would come out the same they did the first time. At this point I was beyond younger and I just wanted to eat. I just felt cheated that they knew the oven was way to hit to cook the pies properly and just giving me a card for a \"free\" pizza was going to see me off to enjoy my burnt undercooked pizzas. Thank you settebello\n",
      "We actually came here for work with the intention of just unwinding with a few drinks at the bar. But after discovering that they had a second Happy Hour going on from 8PM-9PM Monday through Friday, we decided to take advantage. Lots of tasty pizzas for $5! This is a good way to try the variety of pizzas that they have and not feel like you wasted money if you happen to not like what you got. They might not have been the best pizza around, but for $5, they were just fine! The bartender (I forgot his name) was awesome. He was very engaging and our food came out right away. Actually, I can't believe those pizzas came out that quickly. I'm almost afraid to ask. Ignorance is bliss. There is plenty of seating everywhere. Lots of tables and space. Good service, late happy hour, and tasty, cheap food = 4 stars. I'll probably be back very soon.\n",
      "Excellent Atmosphere , Service and Quality of food . Great menu and attentive service from start to finish . Energy was intimate and warm . Highly recommend .\n",
      "This place used to be one of my favorites, but the last time I was there, it was pretty disappointing. The menu was much smaller than it used to be, and an old favorite (Cobb Caesar) was subpar: salty, rubbery chicken, not as many vegetables, smaller portion overall and no presentation. I hope they improve soon!\n",
      "Had breakfast here this morning. I had the eggs Benedict. Yummy, but had to send it back once because my eggs had runny whites. Yuck! The second time around they were perfect. Yummy! Ham too thick, but still tasty. Super yummy homemade english muffin. Rustic to say the least.\n",
      "I will start by saying there is much to like about this restaurant from a location and aesthetics standpoint. It really drew us in. The night we ate there, it was really busy and we sat outside with a view of the capitol. We were kind of forgotton about and had to wait a really long time for all of our food. I am gluten free and this is the main reason I am writing this review. I find reviews of how restaurants handle those who eat this way, for whatever reason, so helpful. This restaurant has a GF menu (I have celiac) which was a huge bonus. However my soup which I ordered off the GF menu came out with a huge slice of sourdough laying on the soup spoon. Not a huge deal to get another spoon but made me nervous as to how aware they really were. Then the wait for our entrees took so long I had to leave with my 2 year old daughter because she had run out of patience. I am sure it is great on less busy nights, but we weren't able to enjoy the experience that night.\n",
      "I didn't get to try the food but I loved the beer selection. I've been meaning to try the stuff out of Surly's and this was my first chance. Pro-tip: have a few and go wander around inside the state capitol building. It's just outside, quite beautiful, and is extra nice with a buzz.\n",
      "Pork Belly Mac. Best thing on the menu. Great beer selection too. The mussels are good too! The place is always busy and takes no reservations. The upstairs room has never been open when we go, don't know of anyone else has had that experience.\n",
      "I'm new to Madison and was hoping to find \"my\" bar; I think that this is it. I didn't try thee food but the couple next to me enjoyed the appetizer they were eating. The bartender was very nice and let me have a taste test of a stout when I asked how it compared to Guinness.\n",
      "Very good bar with a good beer selection and better than average food. The fish fry was excellent, featuring three large pieces of haddock, plenty of fries, malt vinegar, and a shot glass of tartar. The coleslaw was subaverage and boring. Brussels sprouts salad was a surprise standout, with real bacon bits, a lightly applied but heavy cream sauce, and excellent blue cheese. The sprouts were served cold but perfectly cooked. Croutons were inexplicably bland--they were little more than over toasted bread with no seasoning. But the salad itself was good. Poutine is decent; it's all well executed local ingredients but tastes nothing like the rendition I had in Montreal. Not sure where it's off, perhaps the gravy. It's still decadent and tasty, if not authentic. During peak hours they cram people in a bit too closely for my taste. You're practically on top of your neighbor here. In off hours this is a comfortable place to eat and have a drink, and the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable as well.\n",
      "Some friends and I went to Cooper's Tavern for lunch recently while I was in town. I was immediately impressed by the simple yet good looking menu, and had a tough time deciding between one of the salads and the veggie sandwich. I went with the sandwich, and it was pretty good. They give you practically an entree mixed greens salad along with the sandwich, so it was very filling, and tasty. My friends enjoyed their burgers. What I was especially impressed by, however, were the appetizers. We got frites, my favorite, and a pretzel/beer cheese app. Both were great. We also had great service and found it to be a nice atmosphere. I could see returning for some beer one night!\n",
      "I've been to Cooper's a lot and have always been happy! I came here for brunch and had the daily quiche - glazed carrots, arugula, and feta. It was delicious! We got to sit in the private room in the back that is connected to the bar, which is my favorite place to sit. The waiter takes your order and gives you your food through a window from the bar. The room is very intimate and quiet, which is great for groups of 5-8 people. I've also been here for dinner a few times, and loved it every time. The food is very affordable for the quality, and the location is really convenient. They also have a huge selection of beers and wines. If you come at night on a weekend, they open the upstairs room, which is another bar area. I came here with a big group, and there was a large table that could fit all of us. I love coming here, and highly recommend it!\n",
      "So, I ate here last night as part of the Madison Fair Share fundraiser dinner and my group was very excited. We paid $50 for our tickets which included 3 courses - each paired with a beer from One Barrel Brewing. What could be better than a menu that is hand crafted from local ingredients that were grown and brewed around Madison, right? Well, unfortunately for us it was a huge disappointment. We had an appetizer that consisted of shredded cucumber, a rich buttery sauce, and nice pieces of bread. Very delicious and refreshing. The first course was braised rabbit served on a bed of RPs fettuccine with a creamy mushroom and beer sauce. This was really delicious, especially whatever crispy things they put on top. The only complaint is that it was, at best, lukewarm when we received it. The beer was very delicious - an American Pale Ale. The second course was where things went wrong. Strangely enough, they served us salad after the main course. It consisted of a pile of pickled vegetables, including pickled morel mushrooms, rhubarb, radish, and asparagus. It was served on a bed of greens with an ipa vinaigrette. Now, I was very excited about this dish at first - I LOVE pickled stuff. I thought the idea of pickled morels was very exciting and interesting. Unfortunately, everything about the dish was absolutely overwhelming and rather cringe worthy. The vinaigrette mixed with the pickling brine made our eyes water, the anise was confusing and disgusting (admittedly, this may be a personal preference, but we all disliked it), and the greens were overshadowed by all of this. I wish this had been A. served before the main dish, B. had fewer pickles OR a less intense vinaigrette, and C. had more greens to even it all out. The beer with this one was also a loser for us - but we don't like IPA, so that is hard to gauge. The third and final course was a dessert consisting of a strawberry and rhubarb sauce, a key-lime curd, and a rather odd white puffy thing resembling a cham tort. None of us finished it. It was insanely sweet, the white puffy thing was kind of gross, and it was just not satisfying. The beer served with this was really rather ghastly as well - it was a wheat beer and it seriously tasted like cigarette ash. We each managed to take 2 or 3 sips to try and figure out what it was we were tasting, but after that couldn't take another drink. I would rather drink budweiser or old milwaukee, which is just about the worst insult I can give to a beer. Final comments: I had a really delicious old fashioned (brandy, sweet), and the service was really great. The wait staff were really on top of things, and the owner was out there busting his butt, too. I will consider going back for their regular food some day, I just hope this poorly executed menu was a fluke rather than the norm. In the end, it helped support a group I think is doing really great things and I am happy I did it, I just wish it had been a little better.\n",
      "Food was amazing. Had the chicken thigh pot pie and Belgium frites. Absolutely perfect. The drink menu had a little bit of everything. Sat upstairs because the downstairs was packed and had a great time. Staff was attentive and friendly.\n",
      "A 45 minute wait turned into a 70 minute wait. No exaggeration. Food was adequate but nothing spectacular. Menu is very limited. Beer list was vast, but so are the beer lists elsewhere. Far too small for large groups. Couples should have no problems but groups of 4 or more will have to wait forever for a table. Very loud, probably due to the cramped environment. They do stand out a little from the normal Food Fight establishment but I doubt I'll be back.\n",
      "I usually love this restaurant. Tonight though, the kids' meals left much to be desired. The skewered chicken, while abundant, was very dry. My daughter tried to eat it. I guess I thought my Brussels sprouts salad would be a warm addition of pan seared sprouts. It was only okay. At least we started with my fav, the frites with the vinegar mayo. Love. Love. Love. I think the kids meals need work. My kids won't want it again. Service was excellent as always.\n",
      "This is a limited review, very limited. We stopped at The Cooper's Tavern for drinks on a whim because we have some time before our dinner reservation and thought we'd check it out. Since it was before dinner, we were in the mood for cocktails. In retrospect, we should have went with something from the well-stocked beer list instead. Both my wife and I ordered a vodka gimlet. When it finally arrived (through no fault of the server, the bartender was just pfaffing around and talking to other drinkers while he should have been also making drinks), we were disappointed. The drinks seemed to be largely composed of ice and rose's lime juice; vodka was in short supply and there was no lime wedge. Lame, just lame. We sat at one of the tables in the front of the house, the one's made from a barrel with a tabletop. Comfortable enough, but it's pretty damned cold that close to the front window in the middle of winter (and I'm not easily chilled). The rest of the decor seems a bit confused (rustic bar on one side, pseudo-modern restaurant on the other, barrel tables up front). We didn't stay to eat, so I won't speak to that. Not sure if we'll return for dinner or not, but if we do, it will have to be soon. It seems like Food Fight restaurants have a rather quick aging curve when it comes to the food.\n",
      "I am never super impressed with the taste of the food. The last time I went I got a grilled chicken sandwich and it was the texture of a chicken patty.\n",
      "I was meeting some friends here before the Garbage concert. I walked in and there are plenty of seats that Sunday. So I snag a table while I waited. My friends were late but my server made sure I was comfortable. The TV had the Packer game on and I had the One Barrel Brewing's Bilbo Baggins in my hand, so I was okay. The crowd started rolling in about 15 minutes after I sat down. I was glad I got there before the rush. When the friends arrived, our server was helpful and quick with our orders. I ordered the burger. It was juicy and seasoned well. I really enjoy having my choice of greens, frites, or house made chips. I chose the greens and it was a perfect accompaniment to the flavorful burger. My friends had the burger and the special. The special that day was a chicken bacon ranch sandwich on a pretzel bun. She said it was really good. We were all very satisified with our choices. We got done in time to hope in line for our show. I have been here once or twice before and have enjoyed myself. I like the beer menu, it is full of wonderful choices and it's hard to pick just one. I will continue to come and try new things. The Mussels are calling me next time!\n",
      "They have a very nice beer list that rotates often and has many representative midwest micros. The poutine was very good, gravy and curds were excellent, but the fries were a bit heavy handed with the salt. The fries are tasty (if there were a bit less salt they'd be perfect) but they are hand cut and nice and crispy. It was very busy at the time I was there (approx 830pm on a Tuesday night). Its a bit cramped so be prepared to get cozy and be prepared to wait a bit, but with all that good beer who doesn't want to stick around?\n",
      "I tried Coopers Tavern for lunch recently. It has a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. My waiter greeted me quickly upon entering an ushered me to a table. The tables are a mite close together. I'm not overweight, but I did have to rotate to slide in past the next table. My waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. I perused the quite decent beer listing while waiting for my dining companion. There was a number of interesting items on the menu. I was intrigued by the appetizers: beer cheese pretzels, belgian frites, poutine and sconnie egg. I thought about the sweet corn caesar or the brussels sprout salad. A number of the sandwiches also sounded interesting: grilled cheese w/gouda and gruyere, ham w/stout grained mustard, caramelized onions and gouda, but I settled on the turkey with apple-pear slaw and gouda. I wasn't so sure after my first bite. The slaw wasn't what I was expecting, but as I took a few more bites I definitely liked it. Crisp, crunchy, a little bit sharp. It was tasty. What was really tasty were the home-made chips which came with it. Thick, crunchy, really good. I could eat a large plate of these. Our waiter came back often to check on us. I was very pleased with the service. I will definitely go back and try more of their menu. I like the twists they put on what originally sounds like a traditional item.\n",
      "We ate here for the first time and the service was not good, the waitress was not friendly or helpful with the menu selection. We did not have the chicken on our salad we ordered with chicken, she didn't bring the baguette that was supposed to come with it, and the salad was not fresh. I would not recommend this place compared to other places I have eaten, it was terrible.\n",
      "Friendly staff, great food and beer. If you like steak, try the steak frites. It is wonderful. I can't wait to come back.\n",
      "We were coming out of the Capitol and the California family wanted a warm lunch and couldn't handle the wish degree temperature... Was a little worried about about taking the first and closest place, but were we surprised, so surprised! Cheese curd and bone marrow appetizers were awesome and a great souvenir for our trip. The kids loved the Cheese Burgers and quiche and the sweet potatoes chili was great, even after having multiple chili versions over the past few weeks.. My wife's caeser salad was also real good.. Great place, I enjoyed the beer. All around fun time for the family, thanks!\n",
      "I've been here twice for their Sunday brunch and it's been delightful. I live just around the corner from Old Fashioned, but I'll walk the extra block to Cooper's Tavern any day for what I consider to be superior food, service and wait time. It's always busy, but I never need to wait for a table (score!). My boyfriend and I start out with the Sconnie Egg appetizer: Sausage-wrapped egg deep-fried and served with whole grain mustard? Nom nom nom. The first time I had the Scandinavian Eggs Benedict which was pretty good (I was hungover which was coloring my enjoyment of the food), but this morning I had the Blueberry Mascarpone French Toast on Sourdough and I nearly died. Even my bf liked it and he doesn't believe in breakfast foods :) He got their Sunday Roast (Yorkshire pudding, roast beef, mashed veggies and thick gravy) and it was succulent and very tasty. Sitting outside is really fun, today it started raining in the middle of our meal so we ran inside and they found us a table even though the place was packed! Both of our servers have been charming and very attentive. Only reason I'm not going for 5 stars is I've had better Eggs Benedict and I haven't tried any of their drinks yet. Yay Food Fight restaurants!\n",
      "I was very excited to try coops, many of my work friends had tried it and had nothing but good things to say. With that in mind I went in with rather high expectations. I ordered the Salmon Lox brunch, which consists of chive eggs (A+), and salmon with some bread. The salmon is where my experience kinda fell through, I'm no fish conissour or expert but everywhere I've ordered salmon smoked or grilled it's been served warm, this salmon came to me cold as I'm sure was the chefs intention but nowhere or the menu nor did the waiter state it would be cold, this was a big letdown. The portion size was also small given little slivers of salmon but that wasn't a surprise consider it was only $10 The waiters were attentive and friendly. Despite this mediocre experience I'm optimistic that the place has more to offer and can redeem itself.\n",
      "This place is part of the mafia-like Madison restaurant junta known as Food Fight. These guys (and girls) own and operate a number of trendy restaurants around town, all of which I have really enjoyed when I've had the pleasure (Tubb's Tacos, Monty's, Cooper's). The actual building that Cooper's is in used to house a two-story McDonald's, hooray. You figure that getting rid of one McDonald's, in the grand scheme of things, probably doesn't do much. I would guess it's like that old cosmetic myth that when you pluck one hair, two will grow back in its place. So even though there's one less McDonald's in downtown Madison, I'm sure two or three Mickey D's just cut the ribbon in China, or Singapore. But probably not North Korea. Anyway, back to Cooper's. The beer list is long and accomplished (insert crude phallic joke here). Having lived in Chicago for over a year, I was pleased to see Matilda on their beer list. That's not to say I'm above a good PBR to prime the pump. But what exactly was I priming the pump for? Bone marrow, yeah that's right. As an appetizer no less. This stuff was straight beef butter, served with roasted garlic cloves and pumpernickel bread. The flavor is subtle, but the texture...Am I a douche bag if I use the word unctuous? Yes, I think I am. On to the main dish. Lamb sandwich with tomato jam and provolone cheese. I tell you, when that lamb and that jam get together, lots of things start happening in your brain. Let's say your bummed out 'cause you just got audited, or haven't even done your taxes yet, or your dog got killed by some neighborhood kids wielding baseball bats. This sandwich, preceded by that bone marrow, preceded by a PBR...I'm telling you, all those troubles would just melt away, smeared, consumed and digested on a hot piece of pumpernickel toast. But let's say you're a vegetarian. Well, too fucking bad for you, you deserve to have your dog beaten by neighborhood toughs. Kudos to all those who could even remotely follow whatever it is I just said. This place is solid. The prices haven't sky rocketed yet, but it's already starting to get pretty crowded. The new place in downtown Madison to see and be seen, unless your blind. I think my karma just took a hit, ouch.\n",
      "Coopers always delivers. The soup is different daily and delicious each time. Did I mention the vast array of beer? One more great thing. Coopers is well known throught the community for connecting the community to its farmers!\n",
      "I really wanted to enjoyed this place. I really want to enjoy every place I go to but this place made it hard. Initially we attempted to go to the Old Fashioned but there was a 45 minute wait and I am totally not about 'that life'. The man suggested going to Coopers instead and I thought it was a good choice , at first. They do have an expansive beer selection and though I am far from a beer connoisser I found a rasberry one that I really enjoyed. The food at this place is a little meh though. We ordered an egg roll dish with mash potatoes and roast beef that was okay but it was deep fried and it's hard to go wrong with deep fried. To combat that I ordered a salad. The salad was fine but I would have preferred a little less salad dressing on it as the lettuce appeared to be wilted from all the salad dressing. The man got mussels, he gets these everywhere now! I don't think he wanted admit it but he did not like them that much. He kept mentioning that they were okay but he wished they had more flavor. All in all I would go back to this place, not to eat, but to try more beers on their menu. It's kind of a shame because with more effort put into the food this place could be a real winner.\n",
      "The best rueben I've ever had so far. Beer selection was good and the crowd was lively.\n",
      "My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry - I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it. On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg - and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth. Beer - yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?\n",
      "My boyfriend and I just went here for an early dinner on Sunday and we were really quite excited about the place. The atmosphere is like a dark sophisticated pub, the food is upscale but not too pricey, TONS of beer options, and the servers and clientele not too pretentious which we were worried about. My boyfriend is a Reuben aficionado and so he tried that, I loved it, he said it was kind of chewy but it had this different flavor to it that we've never tasted before. Overall he gave it a thumbs up. We shared the poutine appetizer which was overwhelmingly gluttonous but wonderfully executed and tasty. I had the fish and chips with a house salad instead of chips. I felt it was kind of a normal fish and chips, good but nothing exciting about it, and I wished there was some sort of tarter sauce to add some flavor. Overall we thought the food was great and different, loved the atmosphere, and we'll be back soon. Rating: 4.5\n",
      "I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel as though I'm performing a community service by urging others to avoid this place. The beer selection: It certainly seems robust, except for the fact that what you want is nearly guaranteed to have \"just run out.\" Nowhere else in town do I find it necessary to pick 3 beers when I sit down just to ensure they will actually have what I want stocked. The food... yikes. Well it's not cheap, for one thing. Sandwiches run about 10 dollars each and come with only a small amount of (what looks like your standard grocery store bagged) spring mix greens or chips. Frites are an option, for an extra $2 (!!!). The standard dipping sauce for the fries is a malt vinegar aioli, which had the exact aftertaste of spoiled milk and received universally negative reviews from my dining companions. Let's get to the main events: My first entree was the pork belly mac. Plating: Messy, no appealing colors or garnish. Pork belly was splash of dark on the light colored mac. Boring. The pork belly: An incredibly small amount for $14, and ALL fat--no thin strip of delicious bacony meat as you'd normally expect. It was also burned (properly cooked it's crisp, not charcoal) on both sides but lukewarm and gelatinous on the inside. The mac: Sauce was awful. The dubliner cheddar in the sauce made for a grainy texture with very little flavor. In fact at many times the dominant taste was flour... someone evidently needs to work on their roux. You can't be making such a sub par cheese sauce in the CAPITAL OF WISCONSIN. C'mon. My next visit, I got the chicken sandwich. The chicken: Rubbery on the inside, tough on the outside but with no sear whatsoever on this \"pan-seared\" chicken. I'm not even sure how to achieve this texture... steaming? Microwaved? The bread: Toasted sourdough. Half inch thick slices of hard, toasted bread saturated with butter or some kind of oil. The thickness of the bread made it very difficult to eat. Diagonal slices, please. The roof of my mouth thanks you in advance. The accoutrements: While technically there, the bacon, avocado, butter lettuce and cheddar toppings were not present in sufficient quantity to contribute anything to the taste of the sandwich, really unfortunate; it was this combination of toppings that actually drew me to the sandwich. The chipotle mayo added a nice hint of smokiness, and was the only positive part of the experience. DESPITE the truly mediocre food, the service has been fantastic here every time I've gone. The servers seem genuinely apologetic about the food and very knowledgeable about the beers they DO have that might be SIMILAR to what I actually wanted. Suffice to say, I likely won't go back here again. Maybe, just maaaybe for a beer if I'm joining friends, but when it comes to food you can do MUCH better literally anywhere else.\n",
      "Came here for Sunday brunch because the Old Fashioned was too busy. The decor sets one's mind back to a rustic 1980's bar with modern TVs. The actual setup is a bit awkward and tailored more to a bar than a resteraunt but it is called Cooper's Tavern. The food was decent with a few minor execution errors (too much cayenne, over and under poached eggs, way too much salt). Did find a hair in one of our plates. The service was good though. Overall an average place with average food. I would imagine it is better for the bar scene\n",
      "Matilda on tap. Hennepin on tap. Beer cheese and pretzels and pouitine were phenomenal. Can't beat it.\n",
      "This is our go to place. Plenty of comfort food for those cold nights and a nice beer collection on tap.\n",
      "We came here for an anniversary dinner with friends before a show at the Overture. This was the second time we had been here, and thought it would be a good place to go with our friends. We started out with the poutine, which was very good. For the main, I chose the sweet corn Caesar salad, which sounded amazing. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The corn relish was seemingly non-existent. Corn was in the salad, but it didn't really seem like it was part of a relish. The dressing was a poblano-caesar dressing, but I couldn't taste the poblano. Overall, this was just a mediocre salad. My wife and a friend each had the turkey sandwich. They were impressed with the actual slices of turkey breast, and thought the sandwich was good. Our friend's husband had the Reuben sandwich. When the server set it on the table, I was surprised to see how dark the rye was, although the description did say it was a black rye. The description was correct, but the blackness was due to it being burnt. How this got past anyone as being acceptable to serve is beyond me. The server said that it would be taken off the bill. I think this place is OK if you are going for happy hour, because they do have a pretty good beer list and good appetizers. However, I don't think we'll go here again. There are much better choices in Madison and on the square. Edit: they didn't take the sandwich off the bill, just the one beer that he drank. Again, I will not be going back.\n",
      "In loooove. Especially with the frites (and that aioli?!) and the southwestern Caesar salad - it tastes like guacamole and a Caesar salad mixed together. Amazing. Service is always attentive and friendly. Prices are reasonable, too; I got a great, filling lunch with a friend for $10 each.\n",
      "Tonight, I was down on state street and I googled \"reuben sandwich Madison, WI.\" What came up first? The Cooper's Tavern. And let me tell you, the divine direction of the Google gods did not disappoint this girl. I ordered the reuben sandwich with Belgian frites on the side and magner's apple cider on tap. The reuben is as good as they say. The flavors of corned beef, swiss, sauerkraut, and dressing blend to perfectly proportioned perfection. It's mellow, smokey, heaven on toasted rye bread. Here's the clincher: the sauerkraut is marinated in scotch. That's what sets the flavors over the top. I don't think I'll order the Magner's again. Just not a fan. On ambiance: it's long, narrow, warmly lit with candles. Everyone is seated close together. Due to the sandwich being so yummy, I'm sufficiently distracted from the guy at the bar yelling like a caveman at the Reds game.\n",
      "The meals are a-ok but some wines that I'd see in wine shops on the drink menu are a bit over price or just a half full glass. So one day while here in Madison, My Brazilian friend Jessica and I went there for dinner and the one thing that did help the place was the service for the host at the door making some room for the two of us. I can't recall his name by he was a very nice guy and hope he is get an better position there soon. But when he ask us after we sat down what he can get us, we explain to him what we wanted and he told the waiter our drinks orders and that is where it took a turn for slow and confuse waiter service. The waiter after 10 minutes came to our table and ask what can I start you with? By the way it was a male not female waiter, and I reply back and told him we already order when the Host told you our drinks. Then he realize our drinks have been sitting at the bar for a while now. The beer was so so flat and the red was good doe Jessica. Now when it come to food, not a fan of the mussels I've eaten, some of the mussels under-cook and some felt like there were over cooked. Not sure they mix one order with another because they do that kind of thing in a kitchen to make up time. But speaking of time, food times were about 20 minute wait for there was a couple sitting next to us that were there before us just waiting on their food and we got our food first. This is the reason why I said someone mix overcooked mussels with undercooked mussels. But back to the story, as I was saying before, we got our food first then they didn't receive their food until 10 minutes after we received our dinner which means the same waiter can't handle pressure in a fast moving restaurant. Jessica and I felted so bad and was concern about food because she wasn't really happy with the quality of food and I wasn't either but trial and error right. But I'd tip over 25% to the service but that doesn't mean I did that for the waiter. he was slow and only return to our table just twice, one to order food and once we had our meal finish to ask us how was the food and I spoke the truth. So So this can use more of this and that. So I went the next time with a friend to see the difference in food and time to see if there was another cook in the kitchen to try something out and it was difference after eating the salmon and it was delicious and much less wait time and it was still busy. I just didn't want that say waiter again. So is it a good place to bring your other half or your family? Well Family I am not so sure but friend, wife, girlfriend or partner? I would say yes and no because it just depend on your mood and taste. It's up to you\n",
      "The brunch here did not do it for me. Everything felt heavy Heavy HEAVY. The English Muffin was a sponge. The eggs were dense. And my side of fruit was served on the plate with the hot components making for hot mushy strawberries. I feel like you need to be super hung over for this. On the plus side, we had a nice server and full cups of coffee at all times. I'd give this place another try for lunch or dinner.\n",
      "Best burger I've had in Madison - loved that the bread is more of a brioche than a bun. Service was friendly and prompt. My only wish is that they turned the volume on the tvs down a bit. Yes, they're showing European football matches, so it's better than your average bar, but a little less volume would go a long way.\n",
      "Excellent beer/cider selection with many of them offered on tap. The food is original and delicious (I had the grilled cheese - a less exciting options I'll admit - which was phenomenal). The waiter I had was helpful & attentive. I'd highly recommend it as a dinner destination.\n",
      "We came for breakfast after the farmers market. Food was excellent and beer selection was great. Good service. Good stop after shopping!\n",
      "PEOPLE!!!! I specifically downloaded this app and have been fervently typing my first ever review, just so I could give Coopers 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are broke college kids, and we still make the time (and scrounge up the money) to go here around once a week. And when we don't, I miss it! And here's why: THE SLIDERS!!! The sliders are under the appetizer section and I can only assume are the best kept secret on the menu. They. Are. Amazing!!! I'm a burger person (it's my favorite food) so I've eaten A LOT of burgers in my day, but I think these are my favorite. I ordered them the first time I went to Coopers, and I've never looked back. I'm not kidding you, they're the best burgers I think I've ever had. Even though they're under the appetizer menu, I order them for my meal. They come with their chips, so it's definitely enough to feed a person and I've never left hungry (I even have a large appetite!)! If anything, you'll be left licking the plate clean even though you're already beyond stuffed! Like I said, they come with chips, but I strongly recommend upgrading to the frites!!! It's an upcharge of $1.50 I believe, but so worth it! And don't forget the malt vinegar aioli. I wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, but now I'm addicted! As for my sliders, everything that comes on them is delicious. I get mine cooked medium-well and add raw onion, because I think there's just something about the burger and onion combo that can't be beat! I've also has the pretzels with beer cheese dip which was very yummy, and I've tried my boyfriend's food several times (the pork belly Mac, the chicken pot pie, the steak frites) and all of it was good, but the true gem is the sliders!!!! I'm risking my reputation here, and maybe it's just the perfect combination for my very picky tastebuds, but they are so worth giving a try. So once again, if you like burgers get the sliders (add onion if you want to be like me), upgrade to frites, and don't forget the malt vinegar aioli!!! Please people, do yourself a favor!!!!\n",
      "I tried the pork belly mac. It was just ok. I had a very small piece of pork belly and it was very fatty, I couldn't really eat it. The mac and cheese sauce is more like alfredo sauce... not what I expected. A good beer selection though.\n",
      "Pros: Great big beer selection, really nice servers, attempt at a true Irish Pub feeling. Great location on the square, with nice outdoor dining. The menu is a big hit for many, but not me. Cons: It is hard to get a table, it is extremely loud, and the eclectic meal combinations do not always work. I've been to Coopers a half dozen times, and always want to like it more. I find the food is not what I thought I was ordering, and I am jammed into a small space at I table I've waited for too long to be seated at. I will give it another try.\n",
      "Awesome place! Beet salad is amazing! Poutine is also great, you know, if you are into that cheesy, gravy covered goodness. One of the best beer menus in Madison. Staff is always friendly and attentive.\n",
      "I was surprised to see such mixed reviews on this place! I am generally a fan of food fight restaurants so I went in expecting great food and service, and I wasn't disappointed! We went on a Thursday evening so we expected a wait but easily got spots at the bar to grab a brew while we waited. The list of drafts was excellent and I found a new favorite here....Weinstephaner Vitus which is the oldest brewery in the world and this is the only place in Wisconsin the Vitus brew is served on tap...and it's amazing! Our wait was about 30 minutes which was nice, and we got a great table. It's loud in here but full of energy, maybe don't bring your grandma! We had their version of a reuben and the macaroni and cheese and both were fantastic! We also started with the pretzels, which I could have skipped but they weren't horrible. Our service was good and attentive and the ambiance is cozy and bustling! Definitely looking forward to going back!\n",
      "After a recent bad experience, the owner of The Coopers Tavern reached out to me via Yelp. He invited me back to give them another chance, on the house. I have to say, I was BLOWN AWAY by the food and their level of service the second time around. Night and day difference. I really enjoyed my sandwich and the pub chips are a must try. This is definitely a place for a great burger, not so much lighter options like salads--that isn't their thing.\n",
      "The plus: I had a delicious dinner of pretzel-crusted chicken with a hash made of brussels sprouts and squash. The diappointments: Seating and service. Seating: I was part of a group of 10 that was seated in the \"snug,\" a little wooden cubby off the bar. The table would seat six appropriately, not 10, and the stools we sat on were low and uncomfortable. With ten people in there, the voices bounced off the sides and made for a loud and irritating space. What's more, every time someone needed to get out of the space to go to the bathroom, those at the table between them and the entrance to the snug needed to get up and step outside the space, then repeat when they returned. What a bad concept! Service: The bartender, who served us through a window in one of the walls, seemed to rely on charm rather than knowledge or good service. I indicated that I was thinking about having the reisling with my dinner and asked if he thought that was a good pairing. His response was that it was good becuase red would be ordered with red meat. (If he thinks that's what makes a good wine pairing, he is really ignorant and should not work at a bar that serves only beer and wine!) It didn't matter, though, because I never got my wine. He spent at least five minutes telling us why separate checks might not be possible, then provided them anyhow. (Either you do or don't -- make up your mind. Personally, I understand why a server would not provide separate checks and I would not have even asked, but someone else in the group did.) His recommendations of items on the menu seemed entirely based upon telling us about the awards that the pub had gotten. I was not impressed. In addition, being served through a window at the end of the table meant that all food and drinks needed to be passed down the table to those of us at the other end; the same with dirty dishes/glasses. Annoying. I was SO glad to leave that noisy, crowded, and poorly served place. I felt like I was bursting into freedom as I left the restaurant. A good piece of chicken does not make up for the unplesantness.\n",
      "Worst experience ever tonight! Came here for dinner at 9 p.m., we were told the late night menu started a bit early, which we found acceptable. We sat outside and ordered our drinks and food at the same time, roughly at 9:10 p.m. At 10 p.m. we were told our food was given to the wrong table with the exact same order and ours would be here ASAP. As of right now, 10:25 p.m., we still have no food. Our food order was simple Reuben and a medium well burger, neither should take more than 25 minutes. To end it all, we still had to seek out our server to cancel our food, as we had to leave... and we got an apology and a bill for our drinks. Given our experience, I am surprised that they gave us a bill at all. Thank you for the worst experience ever in 10 plus years I've lived in Madison.\n",
      "Stopped here a couple of times for lunch. Seating can be a bit limited, crowded, too. Service was decent, had the beef sandwich, portion sizes were reasonable and the food was quite good. Definitely recommend and will be back. hint: sit at the front window bar stools for faster seating, a view of the Capitol, and good people watching\n",
      "One of the best pub food places around. Since it is so good, it is naturally very busy, I avoid the peak hours to skip the wait. I don't usually dine in pubs, but my friend recommended this place and since then I found myself bringing other friends along again. I tried their coopers burger, the combination of beef, pork belly and cheddar is really creative and gives it a nice finish. The beef is soft and juicy to bite into, perfect for a burger. Their home made chips are also another highlight not to be missed. If you are craving a lot of meat, the pork schnitzel comes with a hhuuuuugggeeee slab of loin, nicely fried till crispy yet tender on the inside. The pork belly mac is also a creative combination -- mac and cheese with pork belly. I have never seen it anywhere else. Appetizer wise, I tried the poutine and sconnie egg. The servings are huge and definitely worth a share at the table. I always ended up half full from the appetizers alone and had to pack half the main course to go. Great dining deal with great food =)\n",
      "Owned by a true Irishman, this place is the best for food and fun with an atmosphere that isn't trying to be something it isn't. A great place to bring your parents, a date, or just go to by yourself for a great meal.\n",
      "I thought it would be a great place to not eat too much \"carb\"age when I looked at the menu. The Reuben has a tiny bit of corned beef with two HUGE pieces of bread. The harvest soup was supposed to come with blue cheese, Which they gave me more when I asked for more. If you have a crappy palate, you'll like this place. They are all about that bread, that bread.\n",
      "What a local gem! I was so happy that my path led me right to this Tavern. Something about it caught my eye as I was sightseeing in Madison and I am so glad it did. I sat at the window looking out onto the Capitol grounds as I ate the most delicious pork sandwich and homemade potato chips. The deconstructed presentation of the sandwich may have been what made this dish work so well. The perfect blend of tangy and sweet. I'm a fan! Too bad I was only in Madison for a few hours!\n",
      "The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the noise. HUGE noise level on Friday night. Nice unique choices on the menus.\n",
      "Phenomenal. There are not enough positive words to describe my recent experience at Cooper's Tavern. I went after a very, very long day of work and Cooper's was exactly what I needed. They have a terrific on tap and drink menu. So many options that the only bad thing is that you simply can't try them all! After drinks, our waitress helped me decide what I wanted to get. I ended up getting the Wagyu beef burger. LIFE CHANGING. The meat was delicious and perfectly cooked. One of the best burgers I have had in Madison thus far. The chips were an added bonus, as well. Overall, the service, beer, and food were incredible. Definitely recommending this place to all in search of a fun vibe and fabulous food restaurant in Madison. Thank you, Cooper's!\n",
      "This place is great. Tasty food, awesome beer selection, and fantastic, helpful waitstaff. I love the atmosphere and the location, too. Have only had the appetizers (the hand made potato chips are awesome!) and beer, but every other dish I saw come out looked amazing. And it's pretty reasonably priced for the quality. Would recommend taking advantage of their beer samples as they have a diverse mix that are hard to find other places. Definitely worth the stop!\n",
      "I love Cooper's Tavern and always have. I am disappointed to see that it does not have the same reputation that it used to on here because I do not feel that the quality has changed. Cooper's is consistent and predictable. When I go there, I know that I will be seated quickly, have an attentive server and eat a solid meal. This last time I went, I ordered the pretzel as an appetizer, the Amy salad with grilled chicken and my boyfriend had the fried chicken sandwich. The pretzel was a little burnt on the top, but the sauces that were served on the side made up for it. I would recommend asking for both the beer cheese and mustard sauce -- They are both worth trying. My salad was yummy and pretty filling but not over the top. The goat cheese medallions that came on the side were delicious! Finally, my boyfriend finished his fried chicken sandwich before I could even ask for a bite. So, I cannot personally speak on behalf of that sandwich, but based on his consumption, I would imagine it was delicious! Go here! Do not let the reviews deter you. The brunch is also always great and they have some of my favorite Bloody Mary's in Madison (that come with a shot of Hopalicious).\n",
      "A year after first visiting, Cooper's has definitely gotten some upgrades! They do offer a little over 20 taps (many local ones), which is more than a lot of restaurants can offer. The beer selection is nicely cultivated as well. I had a lovely IIPA from the Great Dane. The server told me that the Great Dane (a Madison brewpub) only distributes their beer to Cooper's as well as serving it at their own establishments. Pretty cool! They also expanded so they have another floor, which means a shorter wait time. The upstairs is beautifully renovated. Since I was attending for a graduation dinner, the owner kindly welcomed us -- a very nice gesture, and escorted us to our table himself. The menu was fairly limited (perhaps because of graduation), but everybody seemed to find something they enjoyed. I got the mussels and they were nicely prepared with lots of garlic. A few of the people I was dining with said the fish fry was excellent as well...next time. Service was great once again! The servers did well serving our table of 20 plus!\n",
      "I had the Steak Freitas and Green Beans dish and it was excellent. Came here for dinner and drinks on New Years Eve and was impressed with the service and overall environment. They have a great draft beer selection as well to compliment their dinner menu. I would recommend this place looking for a good dinner and a beer close to the square.\n",
      "Coopers Tavern is solid. Solid food, solid menu, good beer selection, soccer on TV. It is not amazing but it never disappoints. It is like your friend who is very trustworthy but not crazy. Supposing, that is, that this friend is English.\n",
      "Great concepts, execution is off. Poached eggs were hard boiled, missing the gooey yellow goodness inside. Steak under seasoned. Duck drummies were fantastic, but served with greasy greens. Stick with drinks and apps and you'll be ok.\n",
      "I was here a few weeks ago, and had an overall good experience. I had a Reuben sandwich which was done pretty well. Perhaps on the smaller side of things, but good. I had greens on the side, which were alright. I also had a bloody mary, which was very good. Served with a side of beer, Wisconsin style. The rest of my companions had good experiences as well. We were seated in a little private room next to the bar which made the experience pretty unique.\n",
      "I was really excited when the Coopers Tavern opened, but after a few visits, I'm a touch underwhelmed. However, they still have fairly good food and beers at a convenient location (with a beautiful view of the Capitol, I might add), so while I don't crave it, I'll probably return for beers and a bit every now and then. The interior is really small, crowded, and loud. I purposely avoid the place when they have live Irish music because it's completely deafening and makes it impossible to talk to anyone. There's often a line on busy nights, and there isn't much room inside for it to grow, so I avoid it more during the winter. In the spring and summer, there's a large, pleasant outdoor patio, which is a significantly more enjoyable area to have a meal and drinks. The bathrooms are clean and well-stocked. If you're going with a group of friends, see if you can use the snug; it's like a tiny bar-within-a-bar that's walled-in and much quieter with seating for up to about 8 people. There's a tiny window that opens onto the bar, making it really easy to place drink orders with a bartender. It's a much more pleasant experience. I notice that their website says they've opened up the second floor Thursday-Saturday 4:30-midnight when there isn't a private event, so maybe this will help with the crowding and noise issues. The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. They're prompt and attentive, and make sure to check that you're enjoying your food and drinks. Nothing but kudos all around for those guys. The tap beer list is seasonally rotated and extensive; it's full of great beers from local microbreweries as well as some other not-so-local yet delicious beers. The bottle beer list is as long as my arm and full of some fantastic choices. I haven't had wine or mixed drinks here, though; the beer selection is always too tempting to pass up. The food is really hit-or-miss. The Belgian frites with malt vinegar aioli are crispy and hot with a good hit of salt, and the aioli is a perfect compliment of acidity with a smooth edge. The poutine, although very salty, is a great winter dish, but far too heavy for a summer evening. The roasted bone marrow is extremely rich. The overriding taste is just pure fattiness. I like fat as much as the next person, but I had to ask for more bread because it's difficult to eat in large quantities at once. It works better as a shared dish. The mussels du jour are a crap shoot, since they are prepared differently every day. I steer clear of the days when they're steamed in beer (especially Guinness), because they taste extremely sour to me. They used to also have a chips and chicken curry plate, which I loved, but it seems to have been taken off the menu. Overall, if I'm in the area and it isn't too busy, it's worth the occasional stop, but with so many other good restaurants in the vicinity, it's definitely not an overriding favorite.\n",
      "Wow! Great place for lunch and it's right by the Capitol! Three of us went and ordered the same thing: soup and salad. I had the special: cauliflower soup and my two friends ordered the tomato soup. Delicious! All three of us ordered the Beet Salad. The combination of the ingredients in the salad was perfect and the dressing was the right amount. What's nice about the menu is that the choices are limited. I like going to places where there aren't 25+ things to choose from. The select menu lists items that have been perfected and are served fresh.\n",
      "I was there only for beer. Great attentive and knowledgeable staff with an excellent selection of brews.\n",
      "Came here for lunch, it was very crowded. The tables are small and very close together so you can hear all the conversations around you. The lunch menu was pretty small just maybe 7 appetizers, 10 entrees (all sandwiches and burgers), and some soup/salads. The price was pretty fair for lunch (~10 + tip) I got the wagyu sliders because I've been wanting to try wagyu beef but honestly.. its alright.. I like the bun which is pretzel and it came with a salad with vingrette dressing. My friend got the chicken with chips and the portion was huge with that. overall, food was okay (a bit greasey) and the environment was alrite but too crowded. I didn't try the beer or drinks because it was lunch. but overall it was alrite.\n",
      "Service was quick and after a moment, friendly. Great beer selection. I got Amy's salad to go. Though it said it came with balsamic vinegraitte, when I got back to my hotel, it was a mustard, garlic, truffle creamy dressing. For me, that worked out even better.\n",
      "Despite being known for it's pub status, I actually enjoy the food more than the brews at this locale. When it comes to brews, I'm partial to the Magner's Pear Cider, an Irish specialty, since it's hard to find and also quite delicious. I've been for dinner and brunch, and both have tasty food offerings. For dinner, I got the polenta and we sat outside. The entrees were all pretty stellar and the atmosphere was equally superb with the capitol lit up in the background. When we went for brunch, I got the sweet potato chili and the poutine benedict, both with their own quirks. First, the sweet potato chili was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy for a mid-morning fix. I secretly wished that I had just ordered a bowl of that for my meal, until the poutine came. The poutine benedict offered a unique, vegetarian spin on a dish that is normally drenched in gravy. Instead, this place throws two poached eggs on top and drizzles hollandaise over the fries. Genuis! The place is great for any occasion, but personally I'd recommend brunch for your first time.\n",
      "We went on a Monday evening and enjoyed a good Irish dinner and excellent music provided by a traditional Irish band. It was interesting that the band was actually sitting at the back of the restaurant while performing...and, of course, drinks conveniently on the table in front of them. Some of the pubs in Ireland are laid back and casual just like this and it brought back great memories of our pub experience in Dublin.\n",
      "Had heard a lot about this place, but was not that good. Outdoor seating seemed exciting because of capital view but seats were uncomfortable with no back support and kept bouncing when someone got up. It was a busy day so service was not good! They undercooked our burger and had to overdo (never asked us how we like it in the first place). You can probably guess how much extra we had to wait! Quality of burger was low! The only good part was the dessert! We loved the creme brûlée!\n",
      "Excellent restaurant and bar! Wonderful service, great food, hip and interesting menu and decor. Love it.\n",
      "I don't know why I keep trying. It's like the substandard relationship that won't quit. Their beer selection is outstanding. The decor is good. The service is alright. But the food, on the three occasions I've had it, has been very disappointing. I would not recommend the pretzel breadsticks, the reuben (salty and dry), or the poutine (neither authentic or good). I did like the pork belly mac and cheese, although I, for the first time in my life, ate *around* the pork belly once I tasted it. I didn't actually know that pork belly could be prepared in a manner that I wouldn't like. So at least it is an educational experience. Lesson: Stick to the beers. And maybe a scotch egg. That thing is kinda good.\n",
      "4 Stars for the Beer Options. I only stopped at this place briefly, but the beer choices were some of the best I've seen. Not your typical bar.\n",
      "Food and beer is excellent, staff leaves something to be desired. Coopers is always crowded and noisy, but it's easy to ignore when the food is amazing. Beer menu is unparalleled in Madison. However something I cannot look past is the inconsiderate staff. If the owner is around, the service is great. If he's not, the hostess forgets about you for 40 minutes. The last time we went, we were told there were no tables available and we had to sit at the table or bar. But there were two tables in front and two smaller tables in back completely open. Our waiter was incompetent and wandered around while simultaneously forgetting some of my food. What gives, Coopers? Get it together.\n",
      "The steak frites was melt in your mouth delicious. Great booze selection too. Everyone was very happy with their food. Only downside is the space and the noise level is quite high. Will most definitely be back!\n",
      "We probably won't come back here for dinner, but definitely for drinks. Great selection and very cheap! (well, to us from the Bay Area ...) I really loved the Fox Barrel Pear Blackberry cider and Derek loved the New Glarus Raspberry. We started off with the pretzels + beer cheddar dip ... How was that so bland? But indeed, it was, and completely unforgettable. Derek got a burger and I got a grilled veggie sandwich. Pretty yummy but not special. We left still hungry, but at least a little tipsy!\n",
      "If you are looking for a place on State Street or the Capitol square that has locally sourced ingredients and a decent beer selection, this is the place. The service was friendly and the food was good. I've gone here for lunch and dinner and was not disappointed. There are televisions in the bar area if you want to watch a game. It's a nice place to go with friends, even if it does feel a little cramped.\n",
      "This place is a heart attack in a box. Waygu everything..bacon..cheese..fried. How about a simpler chicken breast, a turkey sandwich or a non aggressively fat burger choice? Even the salads were loaded with cheese and/or lardons.\n",
      "I like this place for its brunch menu more than its pub scene. It's one of the better ones I've seen. I'm a fan of Cooper's Tavern's eggs benedict, salmon crepe, quiche, and banana bread french toast. I'm positive the other items on their brunch menu are great as well, but I haven't tried them all. Their poutine is pretty legit and the bloody mary definitely helps jump start the day. Don't hesitate; drop by for brunch instead of the usual.\n",
      "Executive summary: salad was fantastic, seasonally rotating vegan AND gluten-sensitive entrée available, server was cheerful, helpful, and funny, atmosphere is cool, restrooms were clean, downtown = no parking. For my full review, read on! I'm not usually a fan of salad as a dinner but their sweet corn Caesar salad was AMAZING! The beet soaked hard boiled egg was a nice touch and the poblano-caesar dressing was delicious. They have a limited gluten-sensitive menu and since they don't have separate friers the frites could be an issue depending how sensitive you are. They do have the local herbivore which is a seasonal rotation of local produce made completely vegan AND gluten-sensitive. The night I was there it was a north African style dish with red peppers, cauliflower, parsnips, and carrots. Since I dislike two of those four veggies I opted for the salad instead, sans-croutons and baguette. My friend had the local herbivore though, and she loved it. Our table also shared the cheese curds and frites. I've had better curds so I only had a few. They weren't worth risking the gluten. The frites were only ok in my opinion. I prefer crispy and these were pretty soggy. The ones at bottom of the cone were especially soggy and oily. The malt vinegar aioli was delicious though. Although, because malt vinegar can contain barley, rye, or wheat it's not gluten sensitive. Our server was great: cheerful, helpful, interactive, and funny. She was also patient. She brought my friend at least 3 samples of beer because my friend couldn't decide which one to order. The restaurant itself is long and narrow with tables on one side and a bar on the other. It's got a cool atmosphere, all old wood and exposed brick. The restrooms could be better lit. And the women's room only has two stalls but I think for an old building downtown that's the best you're likely to get. They were clean and well stocked and in the end, that's the most important. Parking downtown is usually a hassle, especially right on the square so plan on parking in a ramp and hoofing it. I might stop here again in a different season to check out the next local herbivore offering, or the next time I'm hankering for a sweet corn Caesar salad...man was it yummy!\n",
      "My favorite bar at the moment. Vanilla java porter is liquid candy in a bottle, mmmm. Definitely go upstairs if it's open.\n",
      "So - I've been yelping for quite a while and have never written a review. Not cool - I know. Never too late to start! My husband and I biked to Cooper's Tavern as we've passed it several times while at the Farmer's Market on the Square (which you have to definitely check out if you haven't yet)! We were... disappointed. Ambience - really really cute, very nice on the eyes. But the food- mediocre. Do not get the beer cheese pretzels - they're like breadsticks, more than anything else. I got the goat cheese polenta - the veggies were doused in grilling oil and the polenta was... nothing special. My husband got the special- lamb tartine which was good, not great. If anything - Cooper's Tavern is a good place to go for a drink and their fries - which were fantastic! I don't think we'd bother trying anything else on the menu. :(\n",
      "We came on a Saturday night without reservations and only waited 20 minutes. The little wait was SO worth it because we were seated in the mini private room - complete with western swing doors and a personal server window via the bar! Super fun twist to a seemingly normal dinner. I had the mussels and was quite surprised by the size and quality! A full dinner plate of fresh mussels, all decently sized in medium sized shells, in a light sauce topped with fries and bread. Delicious. I definitely will be back the next time I'm in Madison!\n",
      "Cooper's Tavern is top-notch!! The beer selection is plentiful and our server knew about many of them, and was able to point us both in the right direction. The place was busy and continued to get busier while we were seated, however the service remained spot on. Loved the decor, the ceiling fans, the hardwood floors, the old time saloon feel! Though the pretzels are really nothing to \"rave\" about the Cooper's Burger more than made up for it. The pork belly added a little pop to the burger. My \"better half\" had a salad and a veggie chilli which were both very good as well. I love a place that has options for both of us and this is one of them. Keep up the good work Cooper's (but get rid of the pretzel stick things)!\n",
      "Would have given a 4* review IF it the space was larger. We stopped for dinner on a Friday and got a table within 1 beer. This, however, is not the norm. Usually the bar is 4 deep and the wait for a table is over an hour. The beer list is spectacular, I always find something I can't get any place else in Madison. Ommegang Hennepin - YEAH! The food was terrific, as well as the service spot on. I only wish the latest visit wasn't a fluke...typically we peek in and decide it's waaay too crowed and move on. Can't you guys expand to the upstairs space???? NOTE: Coopers is expanding!!! Yes!!!\n",
      "I was in Madison for business by myself and was looking for a spot to just chill out after a long day of meetings. So, based on the recommendation of a local, I headed over to Cooper's. Nice, cozy space--and it wasn't crowded when I was in there. I didn't go with beer on this visit; however, the beer list is really as extensive as everyone says. I did, however, go with a cider. A 22oz delicious cider. I wish I could remember the name....but it eludes me. Now, onto the food. WI is known for it's cheese. Hardcore. Looking over the menu, I was torn between the poutine, bone marrow, pork belly mac and cheese, the reuben and the grilled cheese. I struck up a convo with the bartender....and asked for his recs. He fell heavy on the mac and cheese--even noting that it was featured on the show \"The Big Cheese.\" My response? I'm from New Haven, dude....the cheese shop (and restaurant, Caseus--yum!) the host of \"The Big Cheese\" owns is in my town. So, pork belly mac and cheese it was....and bone marrow. Because, really, who can resist marrow when it's on the menu. The marrow was melt in my mouth delicious. I could have eaten two more, easily. The mac however....after all the talking up that was done...was disappointing! The pork belly was way overcooked (what!). While the combo of cheese used was good, there was something almost...sweet, to the whole dish that just didn't work. Considering the glaze on the belly was Guinness...who knows where that came from. While I won't hesitate to stop back in for the rocking service (seriously, such great bartenders!) and interesting menu next time I'm back in Madison...I won't be trying that mac again. Definitely a good chill spot, though!\n",
      "Waiter was friendly and accommodating. The best service!! Food (hamburgers and fries) was the best! I would give my highest recommendation based on the waiter alone.\n",
      "This place is great!!!! Fast service, great unique food, good beer....what else do I have to say.\n",
      "Thank you Simper! Invited Simper to my office to take headshots for all the employees and couldn't imagen that its became to be a great present for all my staff. The price was very effordible! The crew was very professional and friendly, couldnt ask for better expiriance. Very reccomnded.\n",
      "Got my best picture from those guys for 1/3 of the price I used to pay!\n",
      "I did my profile picture with those guys , the photographer was very friendly and professional. The price 70$ just perfect I don't think it's can be any cheaper than that. They made a photograph studio I'm our community. And did some tach upset on the picture. Thank you guys\n",
      "My company brought these guys to where I work to take some corporate headshots. The experience was great and the photgrapher (Alice) made it very easy and fun. Got the final headshots after a couple of days and i just love them.\n",
      "Maor and Alice came to my office up in vaughan to take 8 headshots for me and my coworkers.. Quick result within few days we got the finished pics .. I started with that couse i wanted to increse my linked-in traffic.. And it defenitley worked. Thank you Maor and SIMPER\n",
      "Aveda fan but disappointed in this salon I was scheduled (scheduled weeks ago) to have an appointment with one stylist. They even confirmed right before the visit. When I arrived, I was told a different stylist would be taking me but no one could tell me why. I wish I had not spent 10 minutes on the phone discussing my hair and what I needed so they could find me the 'perfect person' -since they gave me someone random anyway. Linda was very nice, but the haircut was uneven and the color was very streaky. All Aveda salons try to push their products, but this was the worst. (They put together 4 or 5 \"suggested\" products in a basket and bring it to the station. Linda didn't push the products but the cashiers were relentless. They also cheaped out the validating so I had to pay half my parking. Either validate or don't, that's my opinion anyway. I won't be back. Maybe I am just cranky because my hair came out so poorly.\n",
      "Ha! Never heard you call today! So much for \"trying to make it right\"! Like I said before, this salon is a joke... and I will make sure everybody knows it!\n",
      "Just left the salon feeling better than ever after a cut from Melissa. I had suffered through 2 horrible previous haircuts and was nervous about even the idea of someone making it worse but I had to do something. I joked that my swagger had been stolen with my bad do but it was true! Melissa was kind, funny and honest about the mullet of a situation I was rocking. She made great recommendations, explained what she was thinking, asked questions, and gave this girl her swagger back!! I never knew my hair could look this great! I live in Chicago but work in Arizona on occasion. I will only let this one cut my hair from here on! Worth the flight if I need to make it. Thanks Melissa!!!\n",
      "AWKWARD!! That's how I describe my first experience here. First off, I made an appointment for 730pm. They called me at 645, and asked if it was okay to move my appointment to 745pm. Which I thought was nice and professional of them because they said they \"didn't want me to be waiting there.\" I said that it was fine. I arrived at 740pm, and I was led upstairs and was told to go to the desk in the back. My initial impression was dang! this place is huge! I checked in with a guy who asked \"who are you here to see?\" and I said Stephanie and told me to have a seat. I thought the sofa was comfortable, but there were no magazines. Just some random advertisements on the table. I sat there from 740-800 just sitting there doing nothing, staring at people's hair getting done, and no one acknowledging me. Finally, the guy at the desk said \"you know your appt is at 815 right?\" and I said \"um, no... they called me to tell me it was moved to 745\" and he looked back and said \"of course, it just looked like 8, she'll be right with you.\" and finally offered me a water. Every minute waiting there seemed like forever, and all I kept thinking about is whether I should leave because sitting here with nothing to read, and nothing to look at, and not knowing when I'm ever going to be called, is ridiculous. I wished that stephanie would just come out and at least introduce herself and say hi and tell me how much longer it was going to be. Awkward... :( Finally, at 807 Stephanie came. Finally! Human interaction! Stephanie was good, professional, and obviously knows how to cut hair. There was no problems there and would be happy to refer to her to anyone. Afterwards, checking out, Cody, the woman at the desk who wasn't there when i checked in, asked how my experience was. I told her how awkward it was and how off the scheduling was. She apologized and said they should have checked up on me and shown me where the magazines where (which she showed me were under the side table next to the couch). Apologies are nice, but a nice gesture would have been offering a 10% discount or to validate my parking which would have gone above and beyond the call of duty. And now I felt even more awkward telling her how awkward my experience was. I like the stylist, but I don't know if i want to go through that feeling again! It was awful! Cody, however, hopes that my next visit will be better. :/\n",
      "I've been coming to Mood Swings for almost 2 years and have had an overall good experience, with the exception of a couple hiccups. For the last 8 months I've been seeing Dana. I love coming in to see Dana - she's friendly, open, and always does an awesome job with my hair! I trust her judgement completely on what she thinks will/won't work with my hair. If rating my service from Dana alone, I'd give 5 stars Unfortunately my last provider, who I saw for nearly a year was horrible at cutting my hair and after our year-long relationship I finally opened up to her about trying to cut my hair a little differently and she pretty much popped. It's not that she was doing a bad job, but what she was doing wasn't working for me and I dealt with it for many many months. After her reaction, I spoke to a manager and was ready to take my services elsewhere when she proposed I meet with Dana. Things have been great since then! Other than that, the service is good. Little pricey.\n",
      "Relaxing arm/shoulder massages Relaxing aromatherapy/not-too-unnatural smells Good haircuts Frequent e-mailed coupons and offers Check, check, check and check. Be sure if you're going to the salon, enter the north door, second on left, and go upstairs.\n",
      "Mood Swings is a very good deal for a nice haircut. I am a real cheap-skate and I hate putting down money for non-essentials like hair cuts. HOWEVER, I have learned the hard way that cheap hair cuts actually end up costing you more than a good one. Not only do you look ridiculous, but you end up having a shorter amount of time in between cuts because of split ends, uneveness, etc. It's really not worth it. I can go between 8 to 10 weeks between haircuts at Mood Swings because they are nicely done and wear and grow out well. I love their hand and head massages as well as the make-up touch-up! The only reason I am not giving Mood Swings a 5-star review is the fact that they have nice but super fake service. There's a subtle difference between being polite and attentive and being on a reality TV show. I know that this is a minor quibble, but I thought that it warranted a mention.\n",
      "I moved to San Francisco a month and a half ago, but it's gonna take an army to pull me away from Mood Swings. I love everything about this place - the design, the tea :), the staff, the spa downstairs....AND, most importantly, my girl Lauren! Seriously people, Mood Swings is hella expensive, but Lauren is the best hair stylist/colorist I've had in my LIFE. I go in there, wanting a combination of a bunch of things, and she says, \"ok so what I can do is A or B, A will be ____ and look like ___, and B will...\" you get the idea. 1 hour later, I look like a million bucks, and that's not bragging - that's a compliment to Lauren! Once you find your girl/guy, you're hooked for life. Like I said, it'll take an army. Also, Starbucks is a block away ;)\n",
      "I've been going to Aveda salons for the past 10 years. When I moved to Tempe last summer a friend recommended Mood Swings and I wasn't aware of the fact it's also an Aveda salon. That got me in the door quickly. Unlike most Aveda salons I've been to they don't offer the \"New Talent Tuesday\" reduced prices, but also unlike most salons I've been to, the stylists here go more in depth with the massages and aromatherapy than I've experienced before. I've seen three different stylists (only because I could never commit to a solid schedule, but now that I do I have a regular stylist who I love!) and I leave happy every time. They do a thorough job here and really take the time to get to know your style, what kind of 'do you want and how much time you're willing to spend on it at home. Another positive is that Mood Swings always seems to be offering some promotion. If nothing else, they always have the referral system to save money, or the schedule in advance deal. I love it :) It's a funky little salon with big personality, and everyone there seems so stylish. I've only ever had my hair styled upstairs, but recently was invited to try out some of the other salon services like facials and manicure and massages. I was very impressed with the quality and the people! Everyone is so friendly and really knows what they're doing. That's not always an easy attribute to find. You can be sure I'll be going back to try some more of the salon services in the future. This is a great salon and as a testament to this, it's been in Tempe for 18 years now. Check Mood Swings out :)\n",
      "Mood Swings is the perfect salon experience! I am an aveda junkie so they had me sold on that immediately, but everyone that works here is always super friendly, helpful and on their game! Delores is the besttt!! She was recommended to me by Skylar (who is a star esthetician in the downstairs portion of the salon, who I also love!) I am very picky about my hair, and I swear I will go to no one else! I moved out of state for school, and make sure every time I am back in town to visit her and get my hair cut! (I literally won't get it cut anywhere else!) She is so kind, and skilled, I'll trust her to the end! I rave about her to all my friends, and anyone that I know that has gone to see her swears by her now too! I have gotten my crazy curls both cut and colored by her and she definitely knows what she is doing... With curly hair it is always a challenge, and each curl is different so it has always been a hard for me to find a hair dresser that knows how to work with my hair, but Delores was spot on! She immediately gave me tips of what products to use (not only avedas curly line, but also some of their other products, which is nice because it is good to have options) and knew to dry cut my hair as opposed to cutting it wet (because with curls they shrink up quite a bit when they are dry!) definitely the best hair cut I have ever had! :) can't wait to go back in a few weeks and see her again!\n",
      "This place is THE BEST! well at least Christia is. I recently decided to go blonde and asked my best friend for a good person to get me to the colour I want... (think of Cersei Lanniste from game of thrones) I know thats such a ridiculous reference but its such a specific blonde I was looking for...not stripper blonde, or yellow blonde... but white silvery blonde. Let me just break it down for you, I've been a RED HEAD for the last 7 years.... the moment I walked in and told Christia what I wanted she was in shock.... but let me tell you... it was the BEST three hours Ive EVER spent. She did an AMAZING job, and didn't stop until I was 100% satisfied with my hair colour. It also didn't hurt that the price was a STEAL compared to other places, AND i still had a full head of hair! My hair felt healthy, looked great, and she even gave me some tips on how to maintain this gorgeous new colour she did! Unfortunately I recently moved to Las Vegas... you'd think it would be SO easy to find a good salon to do your roots right.... think again. I, of course went to an Aveda salon... and spent the same amount of time it took to dye my WHOLE head from red to silvery blonde to just do a touch up on my roots.... and the colour didn't even match.. what a fricken nightmare!!!!! ... LUCKILY for me... Christia is a dream come true.. a few texts back and fourth and wouldn't you know, I'm doing my own colour instead of paying 140$ PLUS tip for 1/4 inch roots every month and going back 3 times so the girl can fix it. Not only is Christia a professional, but she finds time to help a girl out! I couldn't be happier... well only if she would do my colour again on my next PHX trip!\n",
      "I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mood Swings! I've been going here for years and I've never had a bad experience. And I can not say enough about my current \"stylist\" Abrelle (sp) ... she's F'n GREAT! And get this! You'll never believe it, but when I get my hair cut ... she puts 100% of her concentration into cutting my fucking hair! Novel I know! I mean, I never have understood why people think that their hairstylist should be interested in their mundane personal lives, and I absolutely hate small talk. Abrelle fuckin' rawks. She says \"Hi, what are we doing today\" and then cuts my hair and gives me the most wickedly great massages (scalp and hand, she used to start with a neck massage to but some how that's been lost, but you know what? That's not her job so, so be it.), but I'd pay the $40 just for the awesome scalp and hand massages she gives. Oh yeah ... she also cuts hair like a champ! Abrelle FTW!\n",
      "My normal hair dresser couldn't get me in for a while, so I tried some place different. My colorist did a great job and the cut was done well. My only complient is the bill. I can't believe how expensive they are for cut and color. My mouth almost dropped when they told me the total. Also it took them over 3 hours to highlight and cut my hair which seemed a little long. I would go back, but won't be a regular on the prices they charge for hair.\n",
      "I really wanted to treat myself and so decided to go in to Mood Swings. They have an introductory cut and style offer for $40. My stylist was Jade. She was extremely difficult to communicate with. She kept looking at everyone else at the salon rather than concentrating on me, or what I need. She never answered any of my questions correctly and was down right rude. I felt like totally walking away from the salon with my hair half cut. She did not even understand how I wanted my hair to be styled and just gave me the ordinary curling iron curls. Was extremely disappointed! Would never go back!\n",
      "I just got one of the best haircuts I've ever had in my life here!!! This was my 1st time in the salon since I just moved here from CA, so thx yelpers for raving about this place. And rightly so! Deanne was my hairstylist & she gave me just what I was looking for. It's been awhile since I've left a salon feeling like I got the perfect haircut, but Deanne worked her magic & I was on cloud 9 when I left. Still am! Not only do you get a great haircut w/ her, you also get a nice scalp & hand massage. She also offered a makeup touch-up at the end, but I didn't have time to stick around. If you're scared to try someone new (like I was), don't be scared anymore. Just call Mood Swings & ask for Deanne. She ROCKS!!! (Also, a very down-to-earth, easy to talk to girl, which is a bonus when you see any hairstylist.)\n",
      "I've been here three times and EACH time I got exactly what I wanted! I had Becca and I HIGHLY recommend her. She is thorough and very much a perfectionist. And when it comes to getting your hair done you need someone to be that way! Bottom line she will make sure you get what you want or what you discussed before the process begins. She's made me come back to make my hair look perfect, because my hair didn't take the color fully (it happens, she did everything right, I watched). Highly recommend her and this salon.\n",
      "I left Mood Swings very disappointed with my cut/style. I took advantage of the first-time $40 deal and got a stylist with less than a year's experience. She was about 20 years younger than I (I'm 42) and gave me a cut/style that someone 20 years younger would have probably appreciated. I told her specifically what I wanted, but she didn't listen to (or hear) what I wanted. I was very disappointed with the style I ended up with. Maybe if I had done more research and specified a stylist with some experience, I would have been happier. Or maybe this salon isn't for women of my age.\n",
      "This salon is the kittie's PJ's! I love Mood Swings! Emily is my stylist and I highly recommend her! She can cut bangs and lasso cowlicks like nobody's business and is so fantastic at suggesting personalized style and color, that not only fit into your lifestyle but totally exceed your expectations! Emily asks the right questions, takes the time to listen and has the vision and skills to execute whatever look you're shooting for. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "How do you know when you have a great haircut? People talk. By that standard I now have the best haircut and most gorgeous color ever - that says a lot because I used to be a de-facto hair mannequin (having family and friends who were hairdressers sure had some perks!). The stylist? The AMAZING Cathy at Mood Swings. She listens so carefully to what you want or need out of a haircut and translates that into art. I've been lucky enough to schedule Cathy several times now and I have always been really pleased.\n",
      "I got the Specialty Pedicure and she did a great job, and I highly recommend the pedicures there. However, I've realized that next time I make an appointment for a pedicure someplace, I need to ask about the atmosphere. Because part of the reason I get them, along with the leg massage, is to relax. She had relaxing aromatherapy oils that were fantastic for me to try. But the music was so loud, I just couldn't really enjoy the pedicure. He did turn it down a bit after a while... but there are people walking around, and it's just loud because it's a salon, after all... noise can't be avoided.\n",
      "Thank you mood swing salon. I called at the last minute for a hair color appointment and manicure and everyone was more than accommodating fitting me in that same day. Definitely will be back.\n",
      "This is hands-down the best salon that I've ever been to. Great staff, great products, and an outstanding haircut every time. My favorite stylist is Nikki, but I've seriously always had a good experience with all of the stylists there. They're patient, they pay attention to what you want but are happy to offer suggestions, and they deliver great customer service. I love the hand massage and hot towel on my hair during the shampoo. Depending on the stylist, I've also gotten the occasional make-up touch-up there for free. Every time that I start to balk at the price ($50 starting for a woman's hair cut) and try somewhere else that's a bit cheaper, I'm inevitably disappointed. (I'm a picky customer who's also wishy-washy about direction - apparently, that doesn't work well for a lot of stylists.) The pain in my wallet is eased somewhat by subscribing to their email newsletter and taking advantage of their 20% off deals for last-minute appointments that they post weekly. They also offer free bang trims if you're a previous customer, which cuts down on how often I need to schedule the full haircut. I will mention that although I love their stylists and their products, I've not had great success with their haircolor services. The fiery red colors that I'm partial to have just stripped right out of my hair within about 10 days when I've had the Aveda color. I've tried a few times, so I know it's not the application method, just the product. However, that could just be a quirk of my particular hair type (fine, shiny hair with resistance to coloring).\n",
      "I had the worst experience at this salon in my life. All I asked and called in advance for was a partial color. I got an email confirmation that it would happen. When I went to my appointment, this was not at all what I got. My hair was washed, I was massaged, my entire head was colored (not the partial color I asked for) then she started styling, blow-dry ing and had me stand and styled and cut some more!!!!!! She even applied product to my hair!!! I was never asked or told I would get all these services. When it was all over, I went to pay, the bill was 215.00 dollars for a PARTIAL COLOR????? I don't think so!!!!!! I only expected 50 to 60 dollar bill. I didn't ask nor was I told by the stylist, she just kept going. I was in shock!!!!!! They wouldn't budge. The manager, even after calling, said nothing would be taken off the bill, not one cent!!!!! I am still fighting this and it's been three months of hell!!!! Don't get ripped off at this salon, don't go there, please!!!!!!!\n",
      "Love the vibe of this salon! Ronnie is talented with hair, book an appointment with him. All of the staff are helpful and friendly. Complimentary AVEDA tea is a plus too!\n",
      "This place gets a lot of really great reviews and I have been looking for a stylist. I was a walk in and got a girl that had 5 years experience. I could tell she was having a bad day and her heart just wasnt in the cut. She didnt seem to listen to anything that I wanted and when she was finished my hair didnt look any different. It was actually way worse than just that but I had started this review months ago and completely forgot to finish so I cant really remember now but I did call in and make a complaint so they set me up with another master stylist who did listen and fixed my hair but it was seriously not worth the high prices that they charge. In fact I get about the same cut form this nice little Asian lady in Mesa that charges $8 at Teasers.\n",
      "Yelp has removed this review twice now, so here I go again. Here are the bullet points: I have had many appointments (I booked a year in advance for over 2 years) be wrong in their book. I stayed because my stylist was amazing, and I figured a solid cut is worth the bit of trouble. I had them basically harass me to stay as a client once my stylist left, to which I had to finally say I NEVER WANT TO NE CONTACTED AGAIN.. EVER My stylist rate skyrockets, but again I stayed due to the quality, but $50 for a mens cut before tip was a little extreme. Lastly, I was warned a day before my appointment my stylist was no longer there, only to find out she had been gone over a week and they were just trying to blindside me sonic come in and try out another gal.. I hope this scathing update will suffice for yelp HQ, as they didn't accept my watered down version of this. Also, I dare them to say this is not based on actual events as I have posted pictures at mood swings & check ins for the entire 4 years i frequented the establishment. Good day!\n",
      "As always I impulsively decided that my hair was too long and that I needed a hair cut NOW! Most barbers and salons would have been closed by the time I finished up at work. Then I remember the Yelp event at Mood Swings so I called and was squeezed in that night. The entire experience was friendly and professional from the phone call to book the appointment to my departure with freshly shorn locks. They remembered me from the Yelp event, probably because I was the one guy there and probably because I drank all of the champagne. Anyway, Alexandra was my stylist and I was very impressed at how she consulted with me on the look I wanted and offered some suggestions so it really was a great experience. I started with a scalp massage then a wash, followed by a meticulous clip and cut, followed by another wash and condition. Alexandra gave me an awesome hand massage during my hotel towel treatment. From there, she styled me and off I went. I have to save that she was so sweet and knowledgeable and a great conversationalist so that it was not one of those awkward, make up some BS to talk about hair cuts. It really was a great experience and everyone there is very professional. And the play great music so it's a great place to come get a haircut . The cost is a little more than I'm used to paying for a hair cut but I really don't get this level of service. I've switched between barbers and salons at least three times since I've lived here and after my experience here I don't think I'll be switching again.\n",
      "I went to Mood Swings about a year ago...it gave me a mood swing, all right. I had a bad, choppy, horrible haircut there. I would'nt go back under any circumstances....\n",
      "I applaud the professional response to my rather emotional review.\n",
      "Came here because it was close to where I live and I found a Groupon for this place. I can see why people could love this place, but it wasn't for me. I guess I just prefer a more traditional/relaxing environment where the music isn't as loud and there wasn't so much going on. The room/decorations were very bold and you can tell each of the stylists were unique in their own way, which is great... but it was really a lot for my eyes to take in.. lol. The stylist I got was Sarah. She was nice and did her best to chat with me, but I'm just overall a quiet person who prefers to be the listener, so I was probably the one who was frustrating her for not talking a whole lot. She was really thorough in covering every inch of my hair with the clear gloss product, but the cut was just ok. She did what I asked with the length of my hair, but she wasn't that great at trimming bangs. The bangs were a little thick and when she tried to soften it up, it came out a little short and the softening technique didn't blend so well. I could tell she was a little nervous cutting mine, but it's no big deal since bangs grow pretty fast anyway. Here's what I do like about the services though: 1. They use an all natural product line, Aveda. 2. The receptionist was very nice and welcoming, and offers you a beverage while you wait for your stylist. 3. They do a hot towel treatment and arm massage when you get your hair washed (I've never seen this any place else). 4. They offer free bang trims to all their customers (but I'd probably look for a different stylist if I went back to do that). Here's what I didn't like about the services: 1. Although the receptionist gave me great directions when I called to book the appointment, I found the place was a little difficult to find. The side of the building facing Mill Ave. on the first floor is actually their office area and they don't really expect customers to walk in over there. There is a way to enter the 2nd floor on the Mill side, but you'll be entering from the back side of their salon. The front of the salon is actually on the Maple side of the building, but there are no signs outside to tell you that. You just have to know to walk up some stairs on Maple side to get through the main entrance. 2. Their policy on parking validation is that they only do it for customers who do a full color treatment because these treatments usually take longer. Well, I happen to have a lot of hair, so Sarah actually spent a lot more time on doing the hair treatment than what she had scheduled for. So the amount of time it took to treat my hair (even though I wasn't using color) should be about the same as any other person who would have used color. Unfortunately, they wouldn't budge so I had to pay extra for parking. :-( Overall this place is not bad, the pros definitely do outweigh the cons. I think it just takes a certain personality to really appreciate this place, and I unfortunately just don't have it in me. So I guess my quest for a hair place that suits my personality.. continues...\n",
      "I don't think I could love Mood Swings (soon to be under a different name) any more than I do. It's always a treat to get my hair done and the stylists are such experts. I know very very little about hair and possibilities, so it's nice to have someone who knows what's the best cut for my face shape and is also able to answer my many questions. I just recently switched to a white/blonde from brunette and every time I look in the mirror, I fall in love again with my new hair color. Ask for any of them-Emily is the bomb!!!!\n",
      "I have recently moved from Flagstaff to Scottsdale, as I used to go to NAU, which has put me in every girls worst nightmare...NEW HAIRSTYLIST! Of course I was frenzied to find a new salon with a great stylist, but the fear of getting what I didn't want kept me away for awhile. At last when my ends were driving me crazy and my roots started to show I gave in. The salon I went to in Flagstaff was run by Aveda so my first plan of action was to find an Aveda salon in Scottsdale or Tempe. At least that way I would get the right hair color! Mood Swings has gotten some great recognition from 944 as well as being featured on many Arizona shows so I figured what the heck.The location was easy to find among the hustle and bustle of Mill and the salon was open and relaxing. The salon also features a community artist every month whose work hangs from the walls. My Stylist Jessica seemed very nice and attentive to my hair. She spent a lot more time doing everything, but I figured that was a good sign as it was my first time there. Although it took me longer to get in and out I was relieved in the end to find my hair looking how it usually does after a trip to Aveda. One thing I enjoy about Aveda salons is that they use natural products on your hair, including the color, so it's much healthier than the harsh chemicals some salons use. They also always seem to have tea on hand, as well as someone who wants to give you a hand massage. In the end the price was a bit more than what I was used to, but you can't really put a price on getting what you wanted from a new stylist!\n",
      "I had the best experience with Dana. I am always nervous about getting my hair done because my hair has been used and abused by hair stylists who don't listen to me when I describe what I am wanting. Dana was so knowledgeable about helping my hair color change to a lighter shade of blonde, and didn't hack off my hair when I told her I am growing it out. She was friendly and conversational and speedy with adding color into my hair. I trust her 100% and will be back regularly to maintain my cut and style.\n",
      "Update: After exchanging emails with Jenny and having a conversation with Glen, I agreed to give mood swings another try. My appointment was scheduled with Sandy. She took the time to listen to what I wanted, offered suggestions and gave me a great haircut! I've always been drawn to Aveda salons because of the high level of service they consistently deliver. I booked my 5 week appointment as I was leaving! Thank you Jenny and Glen for truly caring about your clients experience and thank you Sandy for the great cut!\n",
      "I went in today. I was helped by the stylist Katie. She was very nice and professional. Got a great cut and a massage with a hot towel. It was a great experience overall. The only drawback for me was the price. I will not lie, I'm used to going to SuperCuts, so paying $43 for a haircut and style is hard for me to shell out ($35 cut and $8 tip). Other than that, all was great.\n",
      "Thank you Michelle, and Aria for making me beautiful! And thank you Aveda for giving me the tools to make my home smell exactly like Shampure! ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!\n",
      "Emily is awesome! This salon is trendy, classy, and professional. Every time I go, I love my hair! I've gotten my nails done and facials too. Every service is a great experience.\n",
      "I love being in downtown Tempe, so when I got a SpaFinder gift card for Christmas from my boyfriend, I knew I wanted to use it at Mood Swings. Mood Swings has a fun, trendy salon atmosphere, but everyone is really nice and not pretentious at all. My first experience was getting a 60 min. massage, which felt so good! The spa downstairs was very quiet and I forget that I was in downtown Tempe. Before the massage they had me fill out a questionnaire that asked me if I had a stressful job, if there were any areas that were bothering me, etc...which I'd never had before when I got a massage and helped them get to know me better. I returned to Mood Swings when I needed of a haircut and highlights touch-up. I usually go to a beauty school, but I had a sketchy experience last time that made me want to try somewhere new. I was not disappointed! The salon upstairs made me feel really comfortable and my hair stylist, Brittany, did a great job and I have no complaints! I'll definitely return. They also have a great email program, where they send out last minute appointments they are trying to fill (and you get a discount!) and surveys that also have discounts upon completion. They really do follow up and ensure that your experience is as good as possible.\n",
      "This place has a great first time customer deal to try out the services I went with a haircut and I was very pleased. I returned afterwards a couple of times but I felt that overall it was too expense for a haircut and moved on. It is a very nicely decorated salon and great location on mill.\n",
      "My usual haircutter had the day off when I found myself with an unexpected date for the evening. In a panic I asked for the best gal working that day and they recommended Jade...I was super anxious, because I knew I had to pull out something fresh for my big night, and I'm very picky about my hair...but Jade instantly put me at ease. She's a sweetheart! I had recently watched a lot of music videos on YouTube and wanted my hair cut like recording sensation Maclemore. During the consultation Jade convinced me I was too pale to pull that off (but in a very professional and kind way). Instead she gave me a sweet hi-top fade and I walked out feeling like a million bucks. She even recommended some new gel I had never used before that was perfectly suited to my new style! You can't go wrong with Jade. Professional, knowledgable, skilled, and very friendly. PS: my date didn't go well. I thought maybe It was my personality after a few bad mistakes I made after 5 or 6 drinks, but my date said it wasn't me...she just wasn't ready for a relationship. So that made me feel confident again! Time to take this fly haircut out on the town and see whose impressed. Thanks Jade!\n",
      "Becca is wonderful. She is a skilled stylist and she will give you her honest opinion. I have very straight hair which can be tricky, but she always cuts it perfectly so it falls nicely and grows in well.\n",
      "CARLOS is AWESOME!! I am new to the area and had never been to the salon before. I was attracted to the salon because it is AVEDA and there is a 25$ off coupon for new guests. I tend to get nervous going to a new stylist and have had a few bad experiences in the past, but I can confidently say this was the best \"first time at a salon\" experience I have ever had. Carlos was extremely friendly, personable and an overall excellent hair stylist. He gave me everything I asked for and more - I got a partial highlight, cut and moisturizing treatment. If you goto this salon for highlights and a cut, I would recommend Carlos. He is the reason why I would return to the salon and left me a happy customer! Thanks Carlos!\n",
      "Abby and Jess do fabulous color. I have had terrible experiences in many salons and i am sticking with this place. My hair looks great...this place is definitely worth the money\n",
      "I have loved every hair cut and color as well. I have had three different stylist and they were all lovely. The products are all Aveda, so if you're not a fan, this place isn't for you. They wash your hair and give a hand massage before every cut as well as touch up your make up after! the building and space is beautiful and the little addition of complimentary beverages is nice. Love the quality and the price!\n",
      "Reasons why I like Mood Swings: 1. The Aveda smell - when I first when, I walked in, and thought whoa, this is... herbal. But it grows on you and now I love that smell! 2. Free bang trims for established clients - no appointment is needed. Just walk in when you need a bang trim. 3. Coupons - who doesn't like a deal? 4. Massages - they put a hot towel on your wet hair, which I haven't had at other salons before, and give you a nice hand massage as you're having a little mini retreat. Some girls are better than others. I like that they give you suggestions as to what they think would look good on you, because sometimes I just don't really know what I want. Anywho, I'm sad that I'm moving and I won't be near this salon anymore =(.\n",
      "I believe it was Dolores who cut my hair. I just wanted a touch up & she did a great job. Really nice salon & great location.\n",
      "Delores Turnbuckle rocks. No really, I am not a big yelper and I have to admit that I once was a super cuts girl (when I had super short hair that needed to be cut every 5 weeks), but Delores is making me a bit of a convert. Moodswings isn't cheap, but you do get what you pay for. Delores has always been awesome, which is great when you are spending almost 3 hours in a chair! She is very knowledgeable and skilled, but moreover is a super cool person who remembers me- asks about my life, my work, my girlfriend, and is just plain great to be around. Not to be down on any other Moodswing stylists, but I really missed her charisma when she was in maternity leave and I am so glad to be back with her this week. Book her- you won't regret it :-)\n",
      "I just had my hair cut by a girl named Ciara. She had been walking around Mill offering haircuts for $10 and I know that sounds crazy. I thought so, too. But after not doing anything to my hair in nearly 2 years, I decided to give it a go and if anything, have it fixed by a different salon after. When I went in, through the back I might add, I was greeted kindly though there was no desk. A stylist named Dusty guided me to the desk and I checked in and was immediately offered water or tea. Ciara came over to me once I sat down to wait and informed me she was ready even though I was 10 minutes early. As soon as I sat down in her chair, I was given a water and a calming shoulder and head massage. The haircut itself was very brief and I quickly learned why the haircut was so cheap: Juut (formerly known as Moodswings) encourages all new employees with less than 5 years experience to practice their specialized haircuts in front of masters to show they can execute them properly if given the chance. This information made me more nervous but Ciara stood up to the challenge! Both Dusty and all the other masters in her area applauded her work and even I recognized how lovely my layers looked! I would highly highly recommend a haircut from Ciara! She's so kind and a really great stylist. I'll be back in a few weeks for a color correction on my ombré for sure!\n",
      "I'm very hard to please. I have a ton of hair and have had so many bad cuts I sometimes let it grow out past where I should just because I'm afraid of someone distroying it. I have found my salon. With the exception of one time, I've been very happy with the cut. The one time just told me to switch stylists. My advise is to question your stylist. If you have a new style that you want, make sure that they can pull it off. It shouldn't offend them, if it does see someone different\n",
      "My birthday is coming up in a few days so I decided to treat myself a little bit and get a brazilian wax. I'd been putting it off because it's not exactly a procedure that is comfortable or relaxing and it's always awkward going to a new person to get it done. I finally buckled down and made the appointment though because I'd been wanting it for a while. It took me a little while to find a place to park so I was about 10 minutes late to my appointment and I was worried they would tell me I had to reschedule but surprisingly they still got me in right away. Anita was the aesthetician who helped me and she was super down to earth and friendly and made me feel comfortable right away. She was very informative about everything she was doing so there was never that moment of, \"Whoa! What's going on?!\" I liked that she was talkative too so there wasn't an awkward silence throughtout. One of the most amazing things about the experience though was that it wasn't as painful as the ones I used to get! She doesn't use hard wax at all so it was a lot less uncomfortable. Not to mention she was very fast so I was in and out pretty quickly (definately a good thing with a procedure like this, let me tell you). And because I had such a great experience with this procedure, I'm looking forward to going back and getting other services done too. To me that says a lot about a business and from what I've seen they'll live up to my expectations!\n",
      "I guess I'll be the exception to the rule. Let me clarify a couple of things first, though: 1. I love Aveda salons and this one is no different. The art, the open space, the natural light-beautiful 2. The girls at the desk were beyond friendly and attentive 3. Cecelia, the nail tech, was also competent and wonderful Now to the 1 star bad (which I REALLY hate giving, by the way). I came in with purple hair that I have been cutting myself (along with husband's help) for two years. I've had enough bad experiences to just quit salons all together but this time, I needed to change the purple and this was not something that a box was going to fix. So I make my appt and we talk price. She tells me how much the color will be. Cool. She looks at my hair (it's barely chin length) and tells me she won't charge me for a haircut since I basically just want the ends and bangs trimmed. Super cool! The really good thing is that she took my hair from lavender to a deep, espresso brown and I love it. I mean you can't even see the purple through in the sun. The totally lame, shady part? She repeats at least two more times as she is styling my hair, \"Naw, I'm not going to charge you for the hair-cut.\" She shapes my bangs and off we go to the front desk with people standing around and she turns to me and says this: \"So I'm going to go ahead and charge you full price for one of my hair-cuts and that will make it up for the extra bowl of color I used, k?\" And she walks away.... Extra bowl of color-$20 Her hair-cut price-$60 She basically not only lied to me (three times!) but she also sideswiped me and then gave herself a $40 tip. I was in shock, paid and left and took about this long to process it (happened last Saturday). I have washed my hair since and you can still see the split ends and unevenness from me and my husband's great hair-cutting in the bathroom adventures. I am pissed, to put it mildly. Sorry, Mood Swings, I will not be coming back on March 13th for my gloss because I was quoted $30 but don't want to end up walking out having paid $70 for it to, ya know, make up for the comb usage or the electricity from the hair dryer use.\n",
      "I've been rather hesitant about finding a new place to get my haircut out here, since I moved here from California, but the time had come where my hair absolutely needed a cut. And for guys with longer hair styles, it's hit or miss at some places. Mood Swings definitely did not disappoint. First of all, online appointments? Yes, major plus, especially where you can see which hair stylist you want, with an added bio. Shopping for haircuts has never been so easy. I went to the new Scottsdale location, because I chose to get an appointment with Aubriel (guys, definitely go to her, she works magic with a straight razor, trust me), and it was really, really nice. Super friendly staff, and amazing treatment in a short amount of time (really great if you need a QUICK clean up). My hair is thick and I have a lot of it so I was expecting to be there for a while, but I was in and out in about 45 minutes, including shampooing/conditioning + rinse with a hand and forearm massage. Anyone who can cut my hair that fast and make it look spectacular is worth the money. It is a little bit more on the pricey side, for me, but well worth it if you want to avoid another bad haircut.\n",
      "Worst salon I have ever been to. They let me leave the salon with dye in my hair. I had to go to another salon to have it fixed. By the way this is the day before I went on vacation. I called back to have the dye removed and they told me they couldn't take me until 8 PM that evening. No refund was offered or anything like that! $100 for nothing!!!! Run don't walk from this salon!\n",
      "I've been going to Mood Swings for over a year now and have been seeing Brett. I have nothing but great things to say about him. He always listens to what I want and explains everything he's doing to my hair. After moving to AZ in '09, I tried a bunch of different salons and colorists & wasn't impressed with any. I came across Mood Swings and found Brett & have been coming back ever since. I always leave feeling great & so happy with my color. I rarely leave reviews on sites like these but had to make an exception :) If you go to Mood Swings, see Brett---he's the best!!!\n",
      "Stopped by hoping for a bang trim/shaping and they got me right in! I've been cutting my bangs myself for years bc of multiple bad salon experiences, but today was a different story! Dusty and I talked for a minute about how I wanted them shaped and they came out perfectly. I even prepared myself for the 'hate my hair now, love it tomorrow' syndrome...but instead I left the salon loving them immediately. 10/10 recommend Mood Swings and Dusty\n",
      "Really love what Aubriel has done to my hair -- I went to her for a few years before I got tired paying the high prices (which is why Mood Swings gets a 4 star review instead of a five). I've also seen a few other stylists when I couldn't get in with Aubriel and have yet to have a bad color or cut. I would suggest, however, looking elsewhere for manicures / pedicures -- the prices were also a bit high and the pedicure wasn't that awesome.\n",
      "Free haircut! Yeah! I love my haircut! I donated my hair to Locks of Love, so I got the cut for free. I colored my hair dark brown for $90, but it still looks black to me. I can see the brown color in the sun, but it looks the same indoors. I wish I had done a more dramatic red instead. I have buyers remorse, I guess. I'm uploading my pictures so you can see the difference before and after.\n",
      "Chantel did a great job, listening to what I wanted and didn't want. She gave my current cut great layers and did a supreme job on my bangs. I opted for the extra conditioning treatment, and also got a scalp and hand massage! Very posh and lovely salon.\n",
      "I have been seeing Shelbie at Moodswings for years and adore her. Finally someone that understands curly hair (small miracle). She's always done a great job and the prices here are competitive to other nice salons. I love that you're always offered tea before your appt and the Aveda products make the whole place smell amazing, not to mention the hand massages during your shampoo.\n",
      "This experience was a few months ago but I've just recently made my Yelp account. Sadly, this is one experience that will never let me trust anyone at this location. I came in for a brow wax/ brow shaping and tint. This was probably my second visit. I prefer to go elsewhere but I work on Mill and had been having a very busy week with school and work and decided I needed my brows done just as a self esteem booster. I do not remember who was helping me, but the woman who waxed my eyebrows seemed to be listening to what I wanted but when she waxed my hair she waxed the eyebrow slightly above the middle and left extra hair at the top. The brow tint color was fine, but she did such an awful job at waxing and plucking the hair to shape my eyebrows. I didn't notice until I had gotten home because the lighting in my bathroom is much better. But I was appalled, it's taking forever for my eyebrows to grow back. I really should have gone right back to the store but I didn't know how to address the situation because I've never had such bad service. I'm also disappointed that the person who rang me up didn't mention how bad it looked. Anyways, I will never be back for any services here and I will definitely NEVER recommend them to anyone. If I could give zero stars I would.\n",
      "My color seemed great at first but my hair was pretty damaged and a lot broke off in front.\n",
      "OK, I get it. I used to have my hair highlighted to hide the grays. Now, unfortunately, highlights ain't cuttin' it. But I was going to be dammed before I spent $70 on a single color when I could pick up a couple of boxes from the drugstore for under $20. My tub is stained several different shades now, as was my hair. So, on vacation I decided fine - I'll piss away the money and go to a professional. Called Mood Swings due to the high ratings on Yelp and was very nervous about what I'd be charged (single color STARTS at $70? And my hair is REALLY thick.) But an appointment was available, so a couple hours later, I met Genesis. As I said, I've had \"professionals\" color my hair in the past. Not just highlights, but full single-process color. I have never been impressed, nor have I ever felt as though they did a better job than I could have at home. This was completely different. First off, Genesis was very cool to talk to: did not have that artsy-condescension that I cannot stand in stylists. She applied the color deftly, and before I knew it, it was time to rinse. She then gave the most amazing scalp and hand massages I've ever experienced. Dried my hair and the color is amazing: grays covered, and - even though there were still highlights growing out - same shade from root to tips, looking shiny and healthy. Plus, even though she used several bowls of color (which I feared would be $20 a pop according to another review) - it was the $70 price as listed on the website. Couldn't be happier. Just hope I can find a Genesis of my own in Shy-town.\n",
      "Mood Swings is a fun and relaxing experience. I have never had a bad cut here. Since they use Aveda products, everything smells good in an herbal sort of way. The ladies are friendly, and so is Juan. Rachel usually cuts my hair and I must say, not only is she sharp with the shears, she is a great listener - about my hair and about everything else, too. Mood Swings is lucky to have her in their employ.\n",
      "Alex did an amazing job with my hair. I had always just done the same blah thing and Alex made my hair really hip and stylish. I won't go to anyone else now. I started going to mood swings when I lived near Mill Ave. I now live about thirty minutes away, but still make the trek over there. It's worth it for great hair!\n",
      "My daughter went to Mood Swings at the Scottsdale location. They quoted her $40 for the services she requested over the phone. When all was said and done, the charge was almost $100, and the makeup job they did was so awful we can to come back home, wash it off, and start over. I would never recommend this snooty place to anyone. Ever. And I had to lose $100 to find that out. NEVER AGAIN.\n",
      "I've been to a fair number of Aveda-branded salons in the US, so this review will be a partial comparison to some of those (hence the reduced star). The waiting area facilities (in the middle of the salon, pretty hectic rather than relaxing) and waiting experience (given a shot glass-sized dixie cup of tea rather than a large glass/mug of that delish stuff) are really the only things lacking... I think being on Mill/essentially on ASU campus might count for the differences as the typical customer isn't probably interested in those 'standards' that I have come to appreciate. Also, every Aveda salon I've been to has nice bathrooms outfitted with their products. The restroom facilities here were in the hallway and appeared to be shared with a few offices in the building (?). No nice products and pretty grungy looking IMO... Now to the good stuff -my actual haircut: I requested Jessie per profile on the website and time availability. She was GREAT! Unlike some stylists that are either awkwardly silent or annoying gab-a-holics, Jessie has perfected that balance and was pretty funny to boot. Also, of utmost importance, she actually cut my hair the way I wanted it. Money-saving tip: check out their website if you're a first-time customer - you'll have several options of discounts. I opted for the $40 haircut\n",
      "This place was awful. They did not listen to a thing I said about how I would like my hair and makeup, I even showed them pictures. It was nothing difficult either. It was a simple half up do and a natural makeup. They made me look like Amy Winehouse! Let me add this was also for my wedding!!!! Let's just say I ended up in tears and spent ALOT of money that went to waste. I went home and my sister redid my hair and make up and saved the day. I will never be coming back here. Ever.\n",
      "I admit it, I love Mood Swings. I went to so many salons this past year trying to find the perfect stylist that can fix my curly disaster that I have...and I finally found her. I remember going to Mood Swings 8 years ago, so I decided to try it again. I was recommended to try Shelby, and besides fixing my hair that I now can wear curly again, she also did a wonderful job fixing the color also. With that and the fact that they do a great neck massage and hand massage while you are getting your hair washed makes for an awesome added treat.\n",
      "I've been going to Mood Swings for over 2 years now. Jordan is my stylist. She is friendly and talented. The staff members are friendly and the prices are aligned well with the quality of service. If you like, you can get tea, coffee, or water when you arrive. Something unique at this shop is that you can get a hot/cold towel and hand/arm massage, while your hair is being washed. You can get a $5 discount for scheduling appointments in advance. There are also other discounts, such as for working on Mill or knowing someone else who goes to the same salon.\n",
      "Mood Swings Salon & Skin Spa is AMAZING! I have been a client at Mood Swings since 2006 and have never had a poor experience. I grew up going to Super Cuts for my haircuts and realized after they ROYALLY messed up my hair one day, that you really do get what you pay for given salons. I found Mood Swings since it is conveniently located next to ASU on Mill and had my first appointment with Lauren. I have never gone anywhere else to have my hair cut or colored since! Lauren is awesome. She really listens to what you want and envision and takes her time to make sure you are going to love the end result. I have tried several different color combinations with Lauren, each of which has been gorgeous and extremely trendy. She has done such a great job and has gained so much of my trust that I have gone in allowing her to just color my hair without any guidance from me - all of which have turned out just outstanding. My only complaint is that this place is not cheap. But for the money, you do have an amazing experience, get a great cut, and will leave with beautiful color.\n",
      "This is a very nice, clean, friendly salon. The ambiance is cozy and I thought the Aveda tea was a nice touch....even if it was in a dixie cup. My stylist, on the other hand, did not have such a nice touch. She was sweet and seemed talented enough since she had put herself together nicely. My hair appointment was for a color melt meaning I wanted to get my hair the ombre look. When I began to explain to her how I wanted my ends lighter and the pieces framing my face to be brighter she seemed to understand what I meant. I said the slightest detail about how I didnt want to be to contrasting (like drew barrymore's ombre) and she immediately told me that I needed some color on top, to mix in but at the same time not look like I got highlights. This sounded good to me but I wanted to be remind her I didnt want to die my grow out on top (that had taken FOREVER to get to my natural color). She assured me she knew what I meant but thatd she brighten me up.... and she definitely did. I left there looking like I left my ends dipped in bleach and my roots highlighted like a frosty mini-wheat. I hate causing a fuss but I am so tired of salons talking me out of what I came there for. I also ended up paying an extra $30 compared to the amount they quoted me when I made my appointment. Overall, I don't HATE my hair, it's just not what I wanted. Now I'll have to wait for my roots to grow to achieve my desired look even though I paid a hefty price for that. I won't be returning to this salon.\n",
      "I have been in twice now and I was highly impressed on both occasions! I trust Aveda salons and this place certainly confirms that trust. This most recent visit I had a hair trim, color, and partial highlights from a gal named Emily. I LOVE this girl! I'm totally a socially awkward misfit and getting my hair done is usually uncomfortable since I have no idea what to talk about. Emily made me feel so comfortable and I actually had fun talking to her. Of course she did a fantastic job with my hair and I was beyond happy with the results. As an Aveda stylist she was very knowledgeable about her work and products AND she didn't push any sales on me! Her knowledge alone convinced me to buy a few items.\n",
      "Two Words: Rosemary Mint. Yes, please. I'll take the hand and body soap, as well as the lotion and shampoo! And while I'm at it, can you throw in some Sap Moss shampoo and voluminizer? Thanks. Oh, and don't forget the oils you have - ylang ylang, sandalwood, lavendar. I'm gonna need some of those, too. Oh, you like my hair cut? Thanks. I just got it done upstairs - at Mood Swings. Oh, that reminds me. Add Pure Abundance Hair Potion to my cart. I love me 17% extra body. What? You have Voluminizing Tonic and Phomollient Styling Foam? Throw that in there, too. Love that stuff! Oh, hell. Who am I kidding? I'll just give ya my Visa. Do I get a discount for maxing out my card here?\n",
      "Obviously I'm on a review kick today and I realized that I haven't updated my Mood Swings review since my old stylist Abby moved. I've been seeing Aubriel for the last year or so (give or take a month or two) and in true Mood Swings fashion, she hasn't disappointed. In fact, I love her too! She knows her stuff and has made a point to get to know me. I can trust that if I go in saying \"So... I've been thinking about doing blah blah blah but I'm not sure, what do you think?\" she's going to be honest and I'm guaranteed to walk out with something that suits me, my personality and my lifestyle. I almost always end up buying the products she uses on my baby fine/thin hair - not because she's an upselling queen but because she uses what works best for me which is really the way to win me over. (Btw, Love the Damage Remedy daily repair & I'm totally obsessed with the Confixor liquid gel) Another awesome thing about Aubriel - she always takes the time to show me how to style my hair. She taught me how to use my flat iron for loose curls which I absolutely love. I couldn't have asked for a better Abby replacement!\n",
      "Cannot say enough nice things about this Salon, and Ryan in particular. Listened carefully to what I wanted and did a beautiful job.\n",
      "This was the best experience I have ever had at a salon, and I am extremely picky. I want a lot from my stylist--I consider this a long-term relationship--and I was devastated when my former stylist (the creative director at another salon) retired. Who could possibly live up to her standards? The receptionist here was patient in helping me find a stylist who might possibly meet my expectations, and Delores surpassed every one of them. Not only was she a personality fit (very important to me) but she did what I asked, engendering trust immediately, AND seriously, improved upon the cut I had had for years. Today I received truly the best haircut I have had in five years--exactly what I wanted but beyond what I asked for--along with helpful recommendations on how to emulate it on my own. I cannot wait to go back. I am also really impressed, because the price was HALF what I was accustomed to paying and although I loved the way I was treated by my former person, I have never left the styling chair as satisfied. Making the experience even better is the fact this salon is not only open nights, but also Saturday AND Sunday. So I will not have to take vacation hours to get a haircut.\n",
      "Christia S. is such an incredibly talented stylist, I'm mildly convinced she has super powers. I had been box coloring my hair RED for five years and had an inch of brown regrowth when I had my consultation with her and told her I wanted to be blonde and showed her a sample picture. She took on the very tough task without hesitation and gave me EXACTLY what I asked for, in ONE SESSION while keeping the strength, health and length of my hair. She even perfectly matched the picture! I honestly couldn't have asked for a better outcome. She blew my mind! On top of that, she's a lovely person who makes you feel comfortable and welcome. She takes her time to do it right the first time. I think it goes without saying that I highly recommend her. She certainly earned my business for life.\n",
      "NOTE FROM THE FUTURE: Shelby's now over at Ramon Bacaui Hair in Scottsdale. It's in a great space. They play great music. Everyone who works there is friendly and attentive. They support local artists. And it smells good thanks to all the weird herbs Aveda stuffs into their products. I got probably the best cut I have in recent history--and that's saying a lot for a curly-haired freak like me. Shelby took plenty of time to figure out what my hair did (both good and bad) and tailor the cut to my evil, evil hair. My hair actually still looked good after washing it out the day after. Score! Also, score for the salon experience. Massages, hot towels, great-smelling hair products... It's like taking a freaking vacation just getting your hair cut. I walked out relaxed and feeling great. My kyptonite, though, is the price. It's a great experience, but I don't get a lot of wear time out of my hair. To be fair, Mood Swings does offer free trims between cuts. And they'll knock $5 off if you prebook. So all told, it probably costs less to get a cut at Mood Swings... but it feels more expensive when I'm paying it all at once and whipping out a credit card. And thank God for the dick between my legs.\n",
      "I have been coming here for 10+ years, to get my hair cut, highlighted & styled by Stephanie, Abby & now Lauren. I have yet to have a bad experience. They are an Aveda salon (which I love) located right off Mill Ave in Tempe. Their parking is horrendous but it's worth the trouble. Great atmosphere and very clean. All the staff are super nice. I only schedule with the Master stylist, the price for services depends on the level of the stylist. I love this salon!\n",
      "One of the things I will miss about living in AZ is my hair stylist Becca! She is amazing and I get compliments on my color all the time. I live in NYC now and people ask where I got my hair done. I got an ombré/balayage and it's definitely helped me become more comfortable with color. If you're looking for someone you can trust go see Becca!\n",
      "I have been loyal to Aveda salons (vs. salons that just sell aveda products) for about 10 years. I made the mistake of going somewhere else once, and have never done it again! I love Mood Swings Salon and am a loyal fan. I have had several stylists as it seemed that mine kept moving out of the state! Deanne is fantastic, but sometimes I have to book other folks as she doesn't work the weekends and her evening appointments book up FAST! Ashley is fantastic as well! I love their signature treatments such as the hand massage and scalp massge. I always rave about Aveda and Mood Swings is no exception!\n",
      "Here is a salon that knows how to do things right!!! Every experience has been a joy. The atmosphere is charming, located in historic downtown Tempe. It's a very cool looking place when you walk in, and I love that they have done so much with such an old building. The staff warmly greets you as you approach the front desk, and you relax on comfy couches while you wait, with something to drink if you like. Every stylist I have worked with has been extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date on current styles and trends. If you ask for their opinions, they give them with confidence and work with you to get exactly what you want. I always get compliments on my hair when I'm done and have never had a bad experience. The stylists are friendly and conversational. If I go to the salon in a bad mood, I know I'm going to leave happy. The shampoo process involves a hot towel treatment and hand massage, which is incredibly relaxing. I have no problem asking the stylists for something different in a haircut, because I know they'll get it right. If you're looking for a high-end salon experience, this is your place. They usually get me in for my appointment right on time, which is important to me. There was only one time when they were running behind, and while I waited they treated me to a complimentary brow wax, which was extremely nice of them! Most salons just make you sit and wait if they are behind, but Mood Swings obviously knows how to keep people happy. I have tried a many different salons, and this is THE ONE. Never a miss at this place. Oh, dear Mood Swings, I strayed from you once momentarily to take advantage of a Groupon deal, but never again. I will remain faithful from now on. :-)\n",
      "It was hard for me to find a salon like this when I moved to AZ a couple months ago. By \"like this\" I mean like the male salons I'm used to in Chicago. This isn't a full male salon but they still offer MOST of the services I use. Brody gave me a great cut. He knew exactly what I was talking about and it looked great. When I told him i was new to the area he got a map and circled places and told me about them. That was really amazing. He didn't have to tell me about every cool bar and restaurant in the area but he did and it's going the extra mile that will make me a return customer. The negatives: The coupon thing and rebooking incentives just seem cheap. An occasional promotion is fine but I'm not one for a bargain basement haircut. Also, I just personally don't like hand massages and would prefer something like an eyebrow trim as a bonus during my cut. Not much to complain about. I'll definitely go back to Brody!\n",
      "I can't comment on other stylists at this highly rated salon, so this is a review of one of Mood Swings Salon's stylists, Angie N. The short version is that Aveda Certified Educator & so-called Color Specialist Angie N. did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her. I said and wrote \"apply color to new growth only. Don't overlap, pull thru, or use a gloss.\" She decided color should go 5\" past my new growth. I said I wanted to go 1 to 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60 grams of Deep 10-N @ 45 mins. This provided me with Golden Honey Blond. The sun provided me with multi-dimensionality and sun-kissed streaks. Parts of my hair looked like spun gold and others were like pale blonde sunny streaks. Because I have worn my hair the SAME way in all my outdoor jobs, the outer shell of my hair was very light. With info and request in hand, she formulated 40 vol 60 grams of Deep 12-N @ 45 mins in a shower cap. My crown turned Polar Bear White. When I became upset, she said, and I quote, \"Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard.\" Then she said she'd fix it. So she formulated this toner: 40g 0-N + 40g of 10-N + 1g of Light Yellow Orange + 40mL of CTA. Unfortunately, she toned all 3 feet of my hair--not just the Polar Bear White part. The result: my crown became a monochromatic yet streaky Electric Butter Yellow and the rest of my multidimensional golden honey blond hair became shades of Straw Yellow and included some Pumpkin Orange. It wasn't in shades of blond but in shades of YELLOW as in Crayola Crayon shades of yellow. I believe the 40 vol formula was still \"developing\" when it was rinsed out of my hair, so it stripped out color from the rest of my hair, allowing the pure semi-permanent Light Yellow Orange and the permanent 10-N toner to do what it did to the normally bronze-colored part of my hair: it turned it pumpkin orange. As you can imagine, I had a color mullet. I learned, after the fact, from other Aveda Institute Educators from around the country, color specialists in the valley, and AVEDA CORPORATION that 40 vol us used on people with black/chocolate brown and coarse/curly hair -or- as highlights. I am naturally dark blond; have fair, yellow-toned skin; and dark green eyes. How could she not notice this? I also learned she used one of the LIGHTEST Lift-Color-Methods possible: 40vol/Deep 12-N/Shower cap. I also learned that \"no one\" tones 3 ft long blond hair, and CTA= gloss. Every stylist, Educator, and even Aveda Corp has said that in order to achieve 1 to 2 shades lighter, the Lift/vol should have remained the same at 30 vol, but that the color/Deep could have been changed to 11-N or 12-N. You can create 11-N by simply mixing 1-part 10-N and 1-part 12-N separately. Then that mix could have been added to the volume in the color bowl. One colorist said that keeping my original formula and simply adding in foils would have been enough to make it 1-2 shades lighter or just rinse my hair @ 30 mins instead of 45 mins still using just my original formula. Aveda Corp said she should have known better than to use 40 vol and should have fixed my hair by using golden blond toner mixed with beige toner--not LYO! This will take me 6 years to grow out damaged hair and about $1K to color correct. Plus, it is dry and will require a lot of maintenance & products for the next 6 years. Finally, the real kicker is that color sticks to color. So the White part of my hair may need more correcting over time. I can't speak to other stylists at this salon, but I can speak for Angie N. Unless you want punk-style, Crayola Crayon-colored hair schedule another colorist. Sometimes she strips people of all color and she thinks blondes are hard. Contact me for photos if you'd like to see them! I have several before (beautiful blond), during (white), and after (yellow) photos. I even have a .jpg of the instructions I handed her. BTW, When I had a free color correction consultation with their senior-most colorist (a blond, named Lauren?), she was tight-lipped about how bad my hair really looked; pretended to look at my formulas (I know how long it takes to read them); kept saying that this sometimes happens; and said she'd fix it by toning my whole head--again. The desk staff also gave me the stare down. Since this was the least conservative advice I got from all the color correction specialists (all the others said don't dare add more chemicals to the long lengths), I went elsewhere to get my hair patched up. I think she was trying to protect Angie instead of protecting my hair. Now, Angie is their master colorist/hair director. Go figure that one.\n",
      "Used my Livingsocial coupon with no problems. Cupcakes were good but don't think they are worth the regular price. Disappointed that they only had a few selections of cupcakes in store in the afternoon. Maybe about 4-5 plain looking varieties. They also did not have any macaroons on display or mini cupcakes or cookies. Don't know if these has to be special ordered. I totally forget that they're suppose to offer other goodies than cupcakes. Apparently they didn't since I did not see anything else on display!! Got 9 cupcakes for $24 - you do the math. Probably not return....\n",
      "I have tried the macarons and cupcakes here Both were quite tasty I am not sure about pricing because I recieved the goodies as birthday gifts The cupcakes has a jam filling inside and were very moist The macarons were also quite nice - nice flavour and nice texture The macarons are not huge in size but still very nice\n",
      "$2.50 for a regular cupcake which is mini size in other places, I can just eat it in a bite? I have to say that Crumbs and Co definitely on the pricey side... Chocolate Strawberry Filling cupcake was so delicious!! Moist and flavoured and regrettable small.... Great if you are on a diet.. you really need to savoy every single bite! Staffs are nice and friendly.... and I guess I have to go back and try out other flavour!\n",
      "Difficile de trouver un resto avec des plats aussi délicieux, super abordables et frais pour snacker sur le pouce. Parfait pour un déjeuner copieux, un lunch à emporter ou un souper tardif avec une petite bière en compagnie d'un ami. Le service est amical et rapide, les travailleurs sont des experts du multitasking! Ouvert de très tôt à très tard, c'est un arrêt incontournable du centre-ville à tout heure de la journée. Un endroit charmant, pas fancy du tout. Le seul point négatif que je peux voir est que l'espace est très limité, environ 15 places seulement, donc le resto est presque toujours plein et ce n'est pas un endroit que je recommanderai pour un groupe ou pour occuper un coin à jaser trop longtemps, évidemment. Il faut parfois s'armer de patience car la queue pour entrer peut s'avérer longue en soirée, mais ça vaut le coup!\n",
      "Yeah so I used to live almost right next door and I miss those guys, the plates are generous and it is cheap. It is tiny, less than 20 seats.The burgers at Patati are smaller burgers that you would normally have in other restaurants, which is perfect because the price is also small. You can eat there or take it to go, no reservations of course!! I recommend the poutine patatine or Tofu burgers plate. Oh and the breakfast eggs. Most of the time, there is a line-up outside so be patient! I can't wait to go back!!\n",
      "Yay ! I'm a fan, car j'adore cette petite friterie située sur le boulevard St-Laurent ! Le menu simple offre les grands classiques de la restauration rapide québécoise. Habituellement, je viens ici pour manger une patatine (poutine aux légumes grillés) que j'accompagne généralement d'un burger. Les prix sont très abordables et la bouffe est d'excellente qualité. Les burgers ont vraiment un goût unique et bien à eux. J'enlève une étoile, car l'étroitesse de l'endroit (qui fait pourtant son charme), est aussi son principal défaut. Ce resto est si petit qu'il y a rarement des places disponibles. Il m'arrive trop souvent de rebrousser chemin car le l'endroit affiche complet. Si je fais exception de ce problème récurent, je suggère Patati Patata à tout ceux qui aiment les petites friterie de quartier.\n",
      "I experienced my first poutine at this place. Nice quaint little place, but the food is amazing! I'm glad I got to experience my poutine here. Actually went to this place twice in one day. One for lunch and one for after late night drinking.\n",
      "I consider this place a microcosm of the city of Montreal: unique, bafflingly inexpensive, and phenomenally put together. Some of the best poutine I've had, though the best part to me were the mini burgers that start at a mere $2.50. The place is small, so be willing to wait if you intend to stay and eat. Needless to say, it will be worth it.\n",
      "Surprise en bien! Rien ne sort du congelo, tout est frais. Personnel super chaleureux, très bonne expérience!\n",
      "Such a great little place. Limited seating but I've never had to wait for a table. The service was excellent, even though they were very busy. The poutine is perfect. The regular is just as tasty as the one with onions, peppers and mushrooms. We also had a burger, grilled cheese and onion soup. All were good but the poutine was the stand out dish. Would highly recommend. Great spot for people watching. Also, cheap beer!\n",
      "This teensy, adorable restaurant was recommended to me by a friend who lives locally. After driving Ny to Montreal, we were hankering for something good to nosh on. This place has awesome poutine! The gravy is hot and somewhat melts the cheese curds all over your fries. Fabulous! Who wouldn't like that? I had the classic poutine for $5.50CAD and boyfriend got a slight variation with patatine, which also had mushrooms, onions, and peppers. We both loved what we got. Best of all, the place is very reasonably priced. Boyfriend and I went back a second time for more poutine, a grilled cheese, BLT, and a burger. These burgers are $2.50, with a piece of paper and pencil for you to cross off what you want on your burger. Wonderful. Anything that helps me write down exactly what I want and not have to describe to the cooks that I want a little of this and a little of that- is all welcome in my book. Speaking of which, the young guys who work there are all really friendly, attentive, and even though they were very busy, gave us great recommendations and instructions for local things to do. Great spot!\n",
      "Well, I was able to eat the poutine. Although ..to me, dark fries like that usually signal dirty cooking oil. Here is my major complaint, there are a lot of fruit flies in the place. It kind of made me sick to my stomach. This to me, signifies...dirty, unclean, not hygienic enough. Some people give the excuse you can't control the fruit flies, but i have always found it is only places that arent regularly cleaned deeply...and I don't mean once a month. Well just my opinion. Nice staff..when they don't shout out how much the last customer tipped them in front of you.......It's not the best place in Montreal.\n",
      "We stopped by here specifically for the poutine. The place itself felt like the kind of neighborhood joint with a bunch of regulars and fun, wisecracking staff. Judging from the interactions between the customers and the waiters/cooks, that's exactly what it was. The poutine was good, very rich, and no doubt ranks highly as far as poutine goes in the city. However, for the four or five bucks that it ran us, I was kind of hoping for something more. Also, it came with an olive for some reason. PECULIAR\n",
      "It's a tradition every time we come to Montreal. It's small and cozy. They know the value of a good salad with a side of hand-cut fries. The prices are very reasonable and service is friendly and welcoming. It's that neighborhood place only the locals should know about... Look how special you are now.\n"

      "A good stop if you're cruising the Mont-Royal district, it's bright and colorful, you cannot miss it! Good food, nice portions, and super cheap- I love this place, just can't be beat!\n",
      "Non pretentious, amazing food & friendly service! The staff is very cool & has good recommendations. Poutine is definitely the star on the menu!\n",
      "Great late night spot if you're feeling for some greasy food after a night of drinking. Located on St Laurent and the venue is quite tiny. Can only sit an average of 8 to 10 people at a time. Most people do take out though. I came here for the sole purpose of poutine!! Definitely enjoyed it. Fries were thin cut and the curds were extra squeaky. The gravy is on the little salter side but definitely worth the calories here! For 6$ before tax you get a whooping amount of poutine. Servers and owner are also super friendly guys\n",
      "The poutine is obviously highly recommended here, but other reviews tend to downplay the other food on the menu. This was my first poutine experience, and I'm not a fan...but this isn't their fault. I just don't care for the dish in general, but I was surprised at how good the burgers were. Like everyone says, the price point is ideal. Having splurged at many other places, it was nice to get a delicious meal for a more affordable price. The burger is great with bacon and cheese, and the tofu burger is good if you like tofu - comes with some kind of hummus that I thought was really delicious. I would definitely go back there again, and recommend it for those in Montreal.\n",
      "If you can get a seat in this tiny place you're in for a treat (cheap treat though). I love the open kitchen concept, and the cosy feeling inside. Burgers, salads, fries and poutine are all great here.\n",
      "I had heard a lot about this place's poutines from friends and finally tried them last night. I found the food unimpressive. Their poutine with peppers, mushrooms and onions had all the vegetables raw (you'd think they might sautee or fry the mushrooms a little, or at least the green peppers?). If you're on the Main and looking for a quick bite, it'll do, but I wouldn't go out of my way for their food.\n",
      "We stumbled upon this place for breakfast in the summer of 2014 and wanted to go back every day that we were in town. Windows open, breeze blowing, sipping on freshly squeezed grapefruit juice - I was full of joy. When breakfast arrived with fresh fruit and perfect potatoes on the side, we knew this place would go down in history of having one of the most pleasant breakfast experiences (in the summer at least) of our lives. We left incredibly satisfied.\n",
      "A tiny luncheonette with an eye-catchingly blue exterior and a few tricks up its sleeve. Inside it's little more than a counter with a few other seats around it--room maybe 20 in total. I came here for the poutine, but noticed they also serve borscht, so I got that as an appetizer. The borscht was more a creamy soup than the hearty vegetable soup you might be expecting, and it was beautifully beety. The poutine was... poutine. The fries were fresh--I saw them fried in front of me on the opposite side of the counter--and were offered with an optional salad on the side, which I got and which made me feel better about eating this for dinner. It was good but I think on the topic of poutine, no matter how fresh and well-received by others, I have a heretical opinion: I prefer New Jersey disco fries. Other details: - A fellow down the counter from me got an amazing-looking burger platter--it seemed like four burgers, not exactly small, on a plate, with some salad. This was eaten by one man. I liked him immediately. I wished I'd ordered this platter instead of my poutine. - It's a teeny place, again, not fine dining and maybe not a place to take a first date, but it's got charm, and the folks working behind the counter are young and exude happiness. Anyway, it was nice to sit here a while.\n",
      "Simple cheap food done well! For 6.50$ I had a poutine, salads and slider! Everything was good. I liked the in house ice tea mini pitcher we got and the tofu burger was not bad at all. The service was friendly and quick. Really cute dinner ambiance. Good cheap date night spot! I would definitely go back!\n",
      "Very mediocre poutine. Wasn't even hot, the cheese never even had a chance to melt. The gravy was not that great. Have had a tastier poutine at the A&W on the saskatchewan border. Strange...\n",
      "This is my favorite little spot in Montreal. I would eat there every other day if I could. Everybody raves about the poutine, as they should, it's the best in Montreal. But everything else is amazing too, and much healthier. The mediteranean burger and fish filet are my favorite, along with the salad that's just perfect (the sour cream dressing is the best!). The soups are great too, and keep an eye out for the roast beef weekdays for lunch, they make a mean cheezy sandwich with it!\n",
      "One of the coolest places I've ever been. Tiny hole in the wall with great food and unique charm. Highlights are Poutine, Tofu burger, and cheap beer.\n",
      "We were just walking around starving and came across this place with a little line up out the door (this place is tiny so it looked real full). Lucky for us there was an empty table so we decided to try it out. We got a beef burger, poutine and orangina. The service was pretty good considering there were only 2 people working (one cook and one cashier) and they still have to take care of approx about 5-6 small tables and a line up. They were incredibly effecient and no mistakes! The food was pretty good, well worth the money! (which is not expensive at all)\n",
      "Nice tiny diner here you can pick up a burger, drink, and poutine while all not taking a huge hit to your wallet. It's pretty cozy and the chefs are cooking right in front of your face.\n",
      "Visited on a weekday around midday and there were two seats by the window which was perfect for me and my friend. As noted by others, the venue IS small - and I like it that way. The poutine, both plain/original and the one with bell pepper and olives, was delicious! Better than at Rapido (ugh.) and on par with La Banquise's classic. At that time of day it was busy but not jam packed, and service was good. Not stressed, with a relaxed and casual vibe. The guy serving was super nice and friendly, laughing and joking with us. He even posed for a photo for my friend. The Summer sun streaming through the window and we sat, chatted and people-watched as locals and visitors aliked passed by on Boul. Saint-Laurent. So the entire experience was romantic and magical, a lot like Montreal really ;) So this is now my fave poutine place in Mtl. Bon Appetite!\n",
      "Petit comptoir au coin Rachel et Saint Laurent où la frite est reine. Poutine de qualité, frites de qualité. Pas cher pour ce que l'on mange. Il est même possible de commander par téléphone pour emporter donc assez pratique. Attention il n'y a pas beaucoup de place cependant !\n",
      "This is a very nice vegetable poutine. The fries are soft and well seasoned. The vegetables are just a bit raw for my liking on a hot dish. The gravy is smooth and fresh tasting (not chalky like some junky poutine.) The cheese is fresh. Overall this was a good poutine and the service was fun and friendly. They've got a nice shop going in this small corner of Rachel and St. Laurent.\n",
      "I heard that the fries were awesome, and reading from previous reviews that the poutine was a MUST! You have to have great fries to have great poutine, I think! So during my visit to Montreal, I kept bugging my husband that we had to stop by Patati Patata so I could try their \"classique\" poutine. I agree with other reviewers - this place is really cramped and not for the claustrophobic. The place seats only 13 people max and it is not a place where you want to bring your kids. It is definitely more for take out. You need to know exactly what you want, otherwise you'll have the cashier and cook saying unpleasant things in french under their breath. It happened to my friend, when she wanted to know what another customer was having. They just want you to give a straight order. The wait is incredibly long with the line out the door so be prepared to wait at least 20 mins. Overall, i really enjoyed the poutine! The thin cut fries, meaty gravy, and cheese were just the right amount to complement one another. I don't like it when there's too much gravy that is makes the fries soggy within the first minutes and it becomes a think bowl of muck. However, the portion seemed rather small for the price that I paid and in comparison to other places that serve poutine. If the portion had been bigger I would have definitely given it 4 stars.\n",
      "Patati Patata . I luv their poutines ... Always topped by an olive ... My all time favourite is their tiny cheese burgers. Not your typical burger bun ... It's actually a Portuguese rollThe place is tiny I always take it too go.\n",
      "I love this place for many reasons. I work late so it's great to have something else opened besides a McDonalds. Of course, patati patata is not comparable to McDs. They have cheap prices for delicious food. The staff is very friendly and I love to watch the speed they cook and serve at, it's a show in itself. I usually get the roast beef platter and their homemade ice tea. Both are always delicious. I have also tried their delicious burgers and French onion soup. Very good.\n",
      "Great sliders, fries, and poutine. This little greasyspoon lunch counter has some of the tastiest burgers in the city, and while they're closer in size to sliders, the price is perfectly right whether you want to have one or two. They also make great tofu and fish burgers, too. Of course, no greasyspoon is complete without good fries, and their julien fries are some of the best in the city. I'd suggest trying your choice of one or two burgers with the fries/salad plate, but upgrading the fries to a poutine is a pretty solid idea, too. There are a number of other French Canadian classics on the menu, ranging from shepherd's pie to (all day) greasy breakfast, that are all worth trying, so return visits are highly recommended if you're really high quality diner fare. The only challenge is that seating is very limited, so you might want to consider takeout if you mind waiting a few minutes for a spot.\n",
      "The poutine was awesome!! I don't have much to compare it to since it was my first time having poutine, but it was really good. The atmosphere was real chill as well. I would definitely go here again.\n",
      "Ladies and Gentlemen, These guys here know how to make a tofu burger!!! My first time trying this place out was this year (I know shame on me, 8 years before it happened) but when it did, it was nothing but love love love for the place. So why is the tofu burger special? First Rule of Tofu: Don't make it try to make it what it isn't. They take the tofu cook it up, and they can add cheese to it, but the beauty is in the hummus with it. Add Tomato and Lettuce, and Voilà! Nothing too fussy, too way out there. Poutine: I did find the gravy a bit on the salty side, but I love the skinny, well-done fries and the curd to potato ratio. That's right, no soggy french fries from this joint. Salad: A tossed green salad, with options for their homemade dressing. One is creamy other is oil vinegar based. As the waiter said, it makes you feel like you didn't make the most unhealthy choice ever! Atmosphere: Tiny! I try to come here in non-peak hours, because when its busy, it's freaking busy BUT... the staff is super nice, friendly and accommodating and surprisingly they seem quite relaxed when running the show! Definitely come back when I need a tofu burger! Also hoping to try other stuff on the menu!\n",
      "I don't visit Montreal often enough to say that this is the best poutine in the city. I'm a poutine purist; I'll take the classic fries, curds, and sauce over your fancy concoctions. So just bear that in mind as I say that I'm ecstatic over their poutine. I had the standard poutine, which is made with a chicken-based sauce over a generous pile of fresh cheese curds, and underneath that fries that have been first blanched in lower-temperature oil and then finished a la minute at 375, making for a crispy fry with a fluffy interior. It's a thinner-than-normal fry for poutine (if I had to guess I'd say it's 3/8 inch), but somehow it works for me to get the textures and flavors just right for poutine. The room is tiny; there is maybe space for 15-18 at the bar, counters, and tables all told. For me it's the mark of a joint that does one thing very well, without any wish to dilute that. I also had a perfectly serviceable slider on the side. Their sliders are good.\n",
      "Delicious poutine made in a frying pan with tones of vegetables from onions, peppers, to mushrooms and olives. Vegetarian but you might have to get this one to go since the seating here is limited.\n",
      "Any dumb schmo can eat well for lots of moolah. It takes a savvy Yelper to eat fantastic food for pennies. This may be the most delicious and cheapest meal I had in Montreal (or anywhere else for that matter). I love fried potatoes of any kind but the whole poutine thing kinda jeebed me out. Gravy and cheese curds on frites seemed like guilding the proverbial lily. But when in Montreal, eat like Montrealers, so poutine was tried and thanks to my Yelp research we found this place. Such great food, such nice people (staff and customers alike), such reasonable prices. We had the sole which was lightly and deliciously breaded, with a salad and a side of poutine, plus the local Boreal blonde beer. We enjoyed it sitting by an open window with the view of a small park and the passers by. It was sublime. Go there.\n",
      "I used to lived right at their corner It was my fav food spot around Excellent service by the Cook/waiter And good typical american food Its really small means Its often crowdy with out a free sit\n",
      "This is a cute little place with decent prices. Emphasis on little. And cute. That included some of the staff but I digress. I had a hamburger and poutine and my sister opted for a poutine with veggies. Everything was great except that maybe they forgot it was a veggie poutine until the very end or they just did not ask. The cook threw all the veggies on the poutine raw (mushrooms, peppers, onions) which I thought was odd. We finished and my sister said it was \"ok\" and as we were paying, I noticed someone else had the same thing and they were GRILLING the veggies before putting them on the poutine. No big deal but that is the difference between a 4 and 5 star rating I guess.\n",
      "Very tiny old-school diner type. Packed when we were there. Poutine seems to be the specialty and it was delicious. Service was friendly and funny. Local crowd was having a great time. Menu also had hamburgers and hotdogs I believe. A few local beers on tap that we tried were in the \"okay\" range. Great for people watching.\n",
      "It's hard to believe a place could get 5 stars when we had to wait 1/2 an hour to get served, but it was busy and the guys actually managed to keep track of who came in when and served them exactly in the order they arrived. Oh, and the food was amazng. Linda had a lovely BLT that she said was the best she ever had. I had the plain Poutine, which was magnificent. I mean, just plain amazing. It was the best I've had and I've eaten it all over Montreal. The big thing was the gravy, just plain old-fashioned kick ass. And it was cheap enough to handle with the change I had let over from Au Pied de Cochon. Magnificent!\n",
      "This is a CLASSIC St Laurent street eatery. Its tiny as tiny can get but its the food is the main criteria and it is amazing. Ages ago i used to live in the neighbourhood and would eat here on a regular basis. I've been here so many times that i know instinctively how to order my food to go (which is the best option during the summer) For me this place has the best fries in town. I prefer the stringy, crispy fries (oddly enough have not tried their poutine yet!) The hamburgers is what i always get (unless i'm there for breakfast) and two burgers are always sufficient to hit the spot. Maybe its the crisp toastyness of the bun that adds to the taste. Note: If you suffer from claustrophobia, better get your friend to order for you. This place is tiny and on a busy evening.....\n",
      "Fantastic poutine! Ordered poutine, a pitcher of beer, and veggie burger. The veggie burger was so good I had to get a second. Overall, the prices are okay, but the portions are small and there aren't a whole lot of seats available, so I wouldn't recommend this for large groups unless you're doing takeaway.\n",
      "love this place. good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. their soups are killer, and the place has a lot of character.\n",
      "Minuscule friterie où il est bon se rejoindre (pas tous en même temps quand même) pour savourer des frites maison comme on les aime : grasses, brunes et particulièrement minces!... Mais ce n'est pas qu'un banal boui-boui sans valeur; Patati Patata a su réinventer la malbouffe, voire, améliorer la piète réputation que l'on attribue généralement aux cantines de restauration rapide. Certes, vous recevrez votre nourriture aussi diligemment que vous l'avez commandée, mais tout le charme réside dans l'apprêtage stylisé et l'incorporation d'ingrédients peu communs, rendant ainsi la cuisine nettement plus agréable à voir et à déguster. L'on y sert même de très copieux déjeuners (extrêmement convoités). Évidemment, l'on ne peut pas échapper à la poutine, qui se défend merveilleusement bien... Il y a même un bonus ici; la patatine! Un espèce de repas combinant dégoulinade poutinienne et légumes. Le reste suit tout seul : hamburgers originaux, dont un au tofu!... L'espace est le seul problème... Bondé une bonne partie de la journée, il n'est pas évident de se trouver un coin où manger; et si jamais vous réussissez, il vous faudra tout de même jouer à l'immobile dans l'étroitesse, sur votre tabouret bancal (assez difficile), pour ne pas vous faire accrocher par les interminables va-et-vient des autres clients affairés au comptoir pour emporter qui sert autant de table à manger. À la bonne franquette!.. En tout cas, on en a pour notre argent (cassot de frites à 2$) et les agiles cuisiniers, toujours dans le « rush », n'en perdent pas moins le sourire.\n",
      "Ma place préférée en ville pour venir manger un petit burger en plein été et regarder les gens passé avec un bonne bière en main. C'est rapide, c'est sympathique, c'est pas cher, c'est bon et c'est original! En plus, il y en a pour les végétarien et les carnivores, j'adore.\n",
      "Classic greasy spoon in the mile-end. I tried their poutine, and it was just okay. Powder type gravy, fresh cheese and fries, topped with a completely useless olive. Poutine tasted fine, it looked fine, but it's not all that different in quality or composition than any other greasy spoon you'll find around. At least it was just $5. This place is a lot more about the location (on St-Laurent, near the parcs) and the vibe (tiny old school Quebec diner) than the food. That's okay, just not worth repeat visits unless you're going to become a regular. Tip: if you can get one of the two person tables by the north facing windows - it totally changes the experience. A very nice spot to people watch on St-Laurent & Rachel.\n",
      "Best poutine in Montreal, even better than la banquise in my opinion! Great fries with classic curds and great hot(as in hot/cold) gravy. Very local diner with good vibes and good service, should order the mini burger+poutine+salad combo, the servings are just right not too big, and you can try out everything in one go. Would recommend to anyone looking for the most traditionnal poutine, nothing fancy but with great taste.\n",
      "Super tiny place with counter service and two tables for two. We had the poutine classique which was excellent! The service was efficient at first but very slow after we had finished eating. It took us a long time to get anyone's attention to order another round of beer and then even longer to get the check. They were super busy at the time with people always popping in and out. I can't imagine how much poutine they serve here every day. The lady behind the counter seemed to be making poutine non-stop. Highly recommended for the poutine but realize you might be hanging around waiting for awhile to be served... if you manage to get a seat.\n",
      "It's cheap. It's hearty. It's friendly. It's wonderful. For someone who loves burgers and fries, I can't believe it took me 8 years to try Patati Patata. In my defence, Pitarifique is right across the street. But needless to say, I'm now hooked. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong with this spot. It's a bit cozy, and you may wait for a table, but it's totally worth it.\n",
      "A TINY local place, the servings seem to be proportionate to the size of the restaurant. The burgers may be small, but they are great! Just order a few of them if you're hungry. Fries are solid and the beer is much cheaper than many other places I've seen in Montreal. Not a great place for a date, but a good bet if you're in the mood for some burgers and fries with plenty of local beer!\n",
      "Les burgers sont excellents! Pas trop gros et faits maison. Là où j'ai moins apprécié c'est au niveau de la poutine. Ce ne sont pas des frites à poutine! Petites et craquantes, elles ne sont pas mauvaises, mais pour la poutine c'est un gros non pour moi. La sauce était aussi très ordinaire, pas vraiment goûteuse et plutôt salée. N'y allez pas pour le confort, si vous réussissez à vous assoir vous n'aurez pas envie d'y rester, c'est très petit, mais c'est ce qui en fait le charme de l'endroit.\n",
      "what an adorable, packed place!! it was full of locals and tourists and the 3 guys working were super calm and very friendly! they have a pretty big and impressive menu for such a small place! I had the vegan breakfast while my mom had the egg and chess omelette plate and my cousins hamburgers and fries. the poutine looked amazing too. all in all: a very inviting and friendly atmosphere with quickly made, traditional food that the whole family can enjoy :)\n",
      "My first taste of poutine in Montreal was here!! Super small and cute spot! First of all, i must note how handsome the staff are from the cook to the server are! Now, back to business, i ordered the poutine, beef hamburger and a hot dog. The hamburger is slider size so you will not get full off of one burger. The hot dog was yummy! They give you a small piece of paper for you to check off what type of toppings you want for your burger/hot dog. Lastly, the poutine is tasty...fries topped with thick cheese curd pieces and smoothered in gravy! I would go back for the poutine and hot dog, not so much the burger ( the patty was a bit on the dry side).\n",
      "Patati patata blabla... :-) Pour la faire courte (au possible), un soir où nous ne savions pas vraiment quoi manger.. on repère le spot, pas grand monde. La chance, vu la foule arrivée après nous! 2 poutines, nos premières depuis notre arrivée au Canada. Une obligation. 2 Boréale IPA avec cela. Les poutines arrivent à bon port, la bière par contre en semi cruche mais le serveur avoue son erreur et nous l'offre au prix des 2 bières. Apprécié à sa juste valeur. Les Belges approuvent les frites croquantes, la poutine aussi. Ca retape un homme, comme on dit chez nous! Bonne bouffe un peu à \"l'amerlok'\" et service sympa.. Bref, nous avons notre nouveau spot local (on vient d'emménager non loin de là)\n",
      "Did you actually notice it? I can't tell how many times I have walked pass this corner after my St Laurent tribulations. You will find the tiniest spot blessed with an infinite Plateau charm. Watch out, you may way wait to be seated and don't try to bring a group with you. I visited Patati Patata during a weekday around 9:30ish and I waited 15 min to be seated. I believe it's decent given the popularity of the spot. Once seated, aim for the Boeuf Bourgeois (equivalent to a hamburger) and the Fish burger - extra bacon it tho. Note that you can customize your beef burger. By the way odd detail: according to the staff, nobody takes the tofu burger. And of course, get the poutine. Moreover, the beer is decent despite what the pricing may suggest. But little price implies little food. Yes, portions are small. You're better off ordering two burgers and a side dish. For approximately $6-$7 if you add cheese... and $2 for a beer.\n",
      "Have not tried the poutine. The fries are good but on the thin and dark side and does not seem like it'd stand up well against gravy. Willing to go try the poutine if the schedule frees up a little next time \"In terms of higher end stuff, Patati Patata is my favourite.\"\n",
      "I came here with a friend while we were visiting Montreal for the first time. Neither of us speak French but the staff was very helpful and patient with us! The food was also very very good! My friend ordered the poutine and she said it was the best she's ever had. I had a burger and it was excellent, not too big. Overall, it is a great little place and they were very friendly!\n",
      "I liked their poutine although it was my first time having poutine in Montreal. Curds were delicious and flavorful, gravy was rich but a bit on the salty side and fries were thin and very potato-y. Service is excellent, cute small shop.\n",
      "Finally, I went to Patati Patata and tried their Poutine. Since I am a loyal Poutine lover and big fan, I gotta say that It wasn't THAT good.. I mean yes it was good gravy and good cheese ....but I expected BETTER! when you look at the fires, you can tell they're not really good and in a good shape! I didn't find the Poutine better than any regular resto I usually try... The staff were really nice and friendly, and as always the place was packed! I ended up eating my poutine on the bench on Rachel Street in front of PP. (wasn't a very smart thing to do, you know\"cough\" homeless will keep sticking around \"cough\" ) After all, Patati Patata was good but not great!\n",
      "wonderful atmosphere, great food and beer. the guys working at this restaurant are super friendly, happy to give recommendations, and they provide excellent service. also, very affordable, with perfect size portions.\n",
      "After a gruesome walk, my boyfriend and I needed food in our stomach. We came across this retro and bright colored corner shop and decided to give it a shop. A diner that usually serves locals gave us a totally different feel. The atmosphere was homey and the waiter which also act as the chef was nice and talked to us like he knew us for decades. I saw the menu and was thinking how can a burger at a diner cost as little as $2-3. So, not knowing how the burger will come out we chose to get poutine. The fries were just alright but the gravy was heavily salted. I had trouble finishing my dish. Maybe the burger would be friendlier next time.\n",
      "I love this tiny spot! There's just something so old fashion about this greasy spoon. It's very small, and only run by 2 people at a time, but they are surprisingly efficient. I've only had the burgers and poutines, which are very tasty. My friend loves the fish burger. They even sell beer. Hey... what more do you want. Reasonable prices? They have those as well.\n",
      "Pour tout vous dire, j'avais un peu peur de ma première vraie poutine ! Après tout ce que l'on m'avait dit, \"fais attention tu ne peux rien faire après\", \"n'en mange pas si tu as bu de la bière avant sinon tu vas être malade\"... J'avais un peu en tête une raclette puissance 10 ! Une fois installés au bar, nous avons commandé une patatine (avec des champignons et oignons). Et bien...c'était très bon ! Nous avons mangé goulûment nos assiettes respectives tout en buvant notre petit pichet de bière et on a même failli prendre un dessert ! L'équipe est jeune. En revanche l'endroit est tout petit mais s'il fait beau, vous pouvez prendre à emporter et manger dans le petit square juste à coté.\n",
      "This is by far my favourite poutine place in Montreal. The portions aren't overwhelming and are priced appropriately. The fries are nice and crispy, the cheese curds squeaky, and the gravy just simply divine. I usually get the patatine, but keep in mind that the mushrooms, onions, and peppers are raw (I like it that way but I have friends who don't). If you're still hungry, their fish sliders are also really great, and only $3! Most importantly though, is that they're open until 2am, and it tastes even better when you're drunk!!\n",
      "Petite friterie sans prétention mais qui - comme on dit chez nous - \"envoie du lourd\" ! Dans le line-up (habituel) j'entend ce petit commentaire : \"impossible de faire le combo poutine + burger, c'est bien trop fat !\" qui me challenge d'entrée de jeu. Me voilà donc partie avec mon combo de gloutonne. Et bien je l'ai fait, et c'était excellent !!! La patatine (poutine aux légumes) m'a fait dédramatiser ma gourmandise, et le (petit) burger délicieux m'a enchanté. (Quel régal ce pain !). Croyez-moi, c'est donc bien possible ! Seul hic, le manque de place. A choisir : prendre son mal en patience ou prendre à emporter.\n",
      "Ça fait plus que 20 ans je mange chez patati, jamais déçu, jamais, staff toujours top, burgers toujours top\n",
      "J'y ai pris ma deuxième poutine, la patatine, et c'était excellent ! J'y retournerai !\n",
      "I get so happy thinking about the Poutine I had here last weekend that I cry. I almost didn't want to leave Montreal because of this place. But I had work on Tuesday so I had to leave. Such is life... This place was recommended to us by a former McGill student, a former Montreal resident, and a bunch of random musicians who were selling stuff at a garage sale. So we HAD to go. 9, 9:30pm on the Sunday before Labor Day, we waited about 10 minutes to get seats. The staff was super nice and super helpful with recommending stuff for us to eat. The place was small but everyone in there seemed to be happy and enjoying their meals, and the decor was colorful and inviting. After sitting down I ordered a burger and a Poutine (Patati), which came with the mushrooms and bell peppers (everyone else ordered, actually, the same thing :P). First, the burger. It's this weeee little burger with a soft yet crispy and springy bun and a tiny little patty. Nothing spectacular but really, really fresh ingredients that melded nicely together in my mouth. Now for the Poutine. Let me describe it a-la Ham from the movie The Sandlot. First, you put the fries. Then, you put the sliced mushrooms. Next, you put on the sliced bell peppers and red onion. You top it off with some chewy, mild white cheese. Finally, you finish it off with a liberal helping of dark, beef gravy. Finish by stuffing your face. The flavors blend so well together! The savory of the gravy with the sweetness and freshness of the onions and peppers, with the fried goodness from the potatoes, topped off with the mild soothing nature of the cheese, it equals an explosion of flavors that satisfies with every bite. 5 stars for a cute atmosphere, super nice staff, and great Poutine Revisit? Next time I'm in Montreal!\n",
      "This is a Montreal gem Tiny place, 2 overwhelmed staff, small menu. One kind of beer. The servings of burgers and fries are remarkably reasonable and you could even say health conscious. Very small burgers and the fries are accompanied by a salad. Its not that bad if you don't want it to be. I really love their hot dog I have waiting a very long time here but when you see those people working their asses off you don't mind. Go on off times. You will get pretty cramped otherwise and its a bad experienced to be crushed in line. Again I love this place its got everything going for it.\n",
      "The food is delicious here!!! I went there at night because Ive seen the huge line ups to this place during supper. It was good and seeing thee amount of take outs these guys get I knew I was in for something great while seated in the small corner. The atmosphere is great for students and it also advertises many local events in the restaurants, in case you're someone looking around for whats going on in town.The service is very private and very very NOT intimidating at all. There's only two people serving anyway (one cooking and the other serving) so it felt really nice to be chatting it up with them too without feeling like someones just trying to be nice for you know what .. . ANYWAY all I'm saying is that I always go at night in this place (well the two times I've been here so far) and the food AND service was great even just before closing, not what you can say about most places. My poutine with ground beef was really really good. I highly recommend it. .. wow that was a lot of \"ands\" I want to keep on adding ands but those you have to go and check it.. I kid you not folks this place is a must try! GAHHH AND did i say about the cool prices to this place?\n",
      "Patati and Patata is in a prime location on the corner of st Laurent and Rachel. The poutine has a homemade sauce that has a sweet like aftertaste. The fresh cut French fries are fried not too crispy but not too soft, in other words, PERFECTION. With a generous amount of cheese curds, to satisfy any cheese lover. An important tip is to always get a salad with the poutine, (it's almost the same price) . The salads have a nice variety of greens, its a colorful salad, orange and yellow peppers, onions, olives, with a crispy leafy lettuce chopped to bite size. The salad also comes With the choice 4 different house dressing, my favorite is the balsamic. The fish filet is made to order, they cook everything right in front of you, on a nice fluffy roll . The filet of sole tasted fresh, moist and succulent. There is something to be said about a fish being prepared in front of you also the food is package conveniently for people on the go like myself.\n",
      "Best burger sliders and poutine ever! Ambiance is really nice and cozy. Staff is super friendly. Price/value here is unmatched anywhere. Love this place!\n",
      "Flying in from Southern California and arriving late in Montreal, this is the perfect place to get your poutine fix. It's open late, they serve beer, and the types of poutine are abundant. If it's crowded, order to go and chill at the park across the street.\n",
      "I visited Montreal for a bachelor party and my mission was two-fold: strippers and poutine. I had poutine from the dingy places on the side of the streets and from the fancy restaurants with their fancy steaks. Patati Patata stands above the rest. Simple recipe, friendly service, bumping atmosphere and delicious poutine. What more can you ask for? Sure it may be standing room only and the line is out there door, but these aren't necessarily bad things. PS. who knew there were such thigns as a \"poutinery\"\n",
      "I came here in Summer 2013 (twice) and I loved it! Their prices are very reasonable and I ordered take out twice because I didn't want to wait for a table. The restaurant is very small and can only seat up to around 15 people I believe. The burgers are very cheap (I believe around two bucks) so ordering two will fill you up easily. Their fish burger is also very tasty and their poutine is decent. The walk from central Montreal is perhaps 15-25 minutes so I feel like it's worth it since there is a lot to see on the way to this restaurant. The restaurant is actually pretty hard to spot because the name is kind of hidden so you might want to look it up on google images to prepare yourself. (or just use GPS on your phone if you have data) Patati Patata is the epitome of the term \"cheap eats\" and definitely should be visited by anybody, not only people on a budget!\n",
      "Small place, really simple food but done very well. We had the poutine with mushrooms, peppers and onions and it was very tasty. The fries are thin and crispy and sort of tasted a bit like sweet potato fries but they weren't, so that was odd but still very tasty. We also had the cheeseburger. Great price for a pretty tasty burger, it's a little small but still worth it for what you get.\n",
      "Tiny place with cool atmosphere and a great serving staff. The patatine was nice but not as amazing as I'd hoped. The grilled cheese sandwich and fish sandwich were both very good and we'll costed though. So definitely a recommended place.\n",
      "Self-proclaimed poutine-obsessed girl checking in. On my latest visit to Montreal my friend had the challenge of bringing me the best poutine in the area. I was in town for three days and was getting nervous when our schedules didn't match up on the first two days. However, the stars aligned on day three and I ended up with warm take-out poutine from Patati Patata in my hands. While this was actually my friend's second favorite poutine place, he thought I would prefer it over the other. He ordered me one with peppers, onions, and shaved beef. I usually opt for the traditional but I'm glad he forced me to go beyond that. The fries were crunchy on their own, but gave way to the gravy and became softer. This may sound bad, but I like when the fries can absorb the gravy without becoming mushy. The cheese curds were the perfect temperature even after traveling. The outside of each nugget was just starting to become warm and gooey while the inside left a cooler, squeakier end to the bite. All of the toppings worked together. I especially enjoyed the fresh and colorful peppers. I'm so used to poutine being different versions of brown, but the red and yellow peppers made the visual experience of my meal quite pleasurable. I can't say anything to the interior of the building, service, or really anything besides this one dish, but my poutine senses were thrilled and I could go back to the states a happy girl.\n",
      "This is my first poutine from a regular cafe. The first poutine I had was from Garde Manger (read my other review!) so I might be ruined. However, it was still pretty good poutine. I also got the fish burger. What was most impressive was the dynamic duo that runs the place. They are very busy, they work in a tight space, and are still extremely cheerful and friendly!\n",
      "The national junk food dish of Canada is undoubtedly poutine, the love child of gravy and cheese kurds and a potato concoction worthy of countless heart attacks. After many encounters of this nearly banned food (#1), I'm willing to admit one of the best versions I've ever had was here at Patati Patata. This greasy spoon has a stellar reputation for serving Montreal some of the very best in comfort fare for little money. It's been insanely crowded here almost every time I've been here and is not a place for anyone who is remotely claustrophobic. A 15 person occupancy might be too generous of a number, but it's pretty tight in here regardless. There is barely enough for 4 on their counter, and I've seen some folks literally just stand and eat their food. I've been fortunate enough to score a seat each time, but that wasn't without having to wait at least 20 minutes. Their burgers are good, juicy and flavorful in every bite. Also good are their daily soups, which in my recent case was a red beet borscht - totally worth all $2 of my money. What most folks come for is what everyone should try, their amazing poutine. Cheese kurds sprinkled over a bed of gravy soaked fries, makes for the kind of artery clogging \"salad\" that looks more like a stew of potatoes. Every bite was savory, the gravy was delightful, and the cheese kurds were not in the least bit heavy. Best of all, it cost me only $4.00 for a bowl of poutine goodness. Like only the finest of Montreal businesses, they're open fairly late. Usually till 11PM and as late as midnight on the weekends. Be it for breakfast or a late night anti-hangover meal or even (read: especially) a poutine craving, Patati Patata is the place to be. _______ (#1) They tried to ban this at sporting events in an effort to become healthier and nothing like their southern neighbor. Whatever, I've got two words: universal healthcare.\n",
      "Tiny little closet of a place, very limited seating. Their poutine has great flavour, not overly greasy. Only complaint, you may have to wait a bit to get their attention to order take-out.\n",
      "I had their regular poutine and I didn't like it too much. The gravy was sour (not that it went bad or anything) because of the olives. I loved the atmosphere of the store though, it's really small but they're really quick to serve you since the seats are limited. Many people get a takeout here because of that. But the rotation is so quick that we found seats quite immediately. Overall, it didn't make a lasting impression on me, especially in terms of the food quality.\n",
      "This place has such delicious poutine! I got the kind with bell peppers and mushrooms and it was so yummy! And it wasn't a ridiculously large portion so a friend and I could share it and still have room for a burger or two. Speaking of which, I had 2 small burgers (mini burgers) and they were delicious. I got all the toppings on it and the bread it was on was so good and you could tell it had been made fresh! There were only 3 guys working when I went and they were serving people very fast! Although this place feels like a little broom closet inside, it packs a lot of flavor!\n",
      "Cheap, funky, and friendly. 100% Plateau style.\n",
      "What a fabulous place. Good people, good service, great atmosphere, great food. Definitely worth a visit - or three... well four or more... hell, become a regular - you won't regret it...\n",
      "Thanks to Yelp, I found this place. It was a hike up the hill from my hotel on St. Catharines Street, but it was well worth it. The sandwiches were great, and the poutine was as advertised.\n",
      "What a great introduction to the city! My fiancee and I stopped in here for some poutine, based on a couple of recommendations from chowhound and were really taken with the place. The waitstaff were really courteous and patient with our lack of french. Food came quickly. I had a full order of poutine and my fiancee had Poutine et Salade. The poutines were awesome, crisp clean real potato fries, a light gravy and good curds. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough gravy to melt most of the curds, otherwise it was the best poutine I had in the city. The salad was very nicely composed and all the ingredients were fresh. I paired the poutine with a Vieux Montreal Blonde, which was passable as a Blonde Ale, but seemed like the right aesthetic fit for the restaurant. Other diners were eating these adorable tiny burgers, which seemed like an excellent late night snack. Definitely a unique and welcoming representation of the city, especially late at night. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This place is charming, delicious and cheap! So why only 4 stars? It's WAY too small, probably sits 16 people max but that's also part of it's charm :) The service was good, the food was awesome! Burgers are small but are cheap and if you get poutine with it you'll be full. Definitely go but be prepared to wait a while, uncomfortably watching people eat as you wait for a spot. BUT ITS SO WORTH IT! note: not very good for groups larger than 2 or 3.\n",
      "The burger was fabulous, including the bread. I am glad we chose this place. You are given a paper to mark down everything you want on your burger and it is kade to order. Service was good and fast. It was exactly what we were looking for- a quick and tasty dinner before heading back to our hotel after a long day.\n",
      "L'endroit est certes riquiqui à l'intérieur, mais la devanture toute en couleur permet de le localiser rapidement sur saint Laurent/Rachel! Si vous voulez manger sur place, il faut être soit patient, soit chanceux:quelques places au comptoir et 3 tables de bar, ça fait peu de places assises! Mais la carte vaut le détour! Le burger est fait dans du vrai pain, avec de bons ingrédients frais. L'assiette de frites et salade que l'on peut prendre en accompagnement est copieuse. La patatine est à goûter, de même que le jus orange/pamplemousse. On prend toujours les brownies à emporter, que l'on rentre déguster avec de la glace à la vanille... Un régal! Bref, le rapport prix/quantité/qualité est imbattable!!\n",
      "Tiny little hole-in-the-wall joint with maybe 6 bar stools + 4 small tables. Poutine is the specialty, but lots of other stuff on the menu. Only 2 guys working, and with a line usually out the door, you have to be patient. I mean these guys are working their cojones off, and still maintain a pleasant demeanor even though they don't have time to catch their breath. Food prices are cheap, and a 10 ounce draft beer is a very reasonable $2.50.\n",
      "we were excited to come here as we kept passing it on our strolls, the food was unremarkable, the beer was really good; however, their service was rushed and angry. in this industry (also in such a tiny shop) this makes all the difference. the man at the cash register was annoyed and loudly tried to tell me \"how service works in North America\" all over a misunderstanding. I'm an Asian American born and raised in North America and that comment was a slap in the face. I don't know where he might have thought I was from but does that matter? thumbs down for ignorance and poutine that was mediocre at best. thumbs up for beer and beer only (since it probably made me docile enough to tolerate inexcusable behavior from the staff)\n",
      "Had my last lunch here before moving out of my apartment in the lower plateau to one downtown, closer to school-- it was a really sad day. This cramped little dive always has a line up and let me tell you: worth the wait. The space: Well to cut it short: there is none. The vibe: Very friendly, super chill(despite the busy-ness), lots of locals. The main event: That poutine is to die for. I don't know how they keep the fries crispy BUT THEY DO. And that gravy: it's like the world's most heavenly foodgasm in your mouth. I kid you not, I've never tried a gravy that delicious in my life. Words cannot fathom the magic that sizzles into your life when that first drop of gravy hits your tongue. It's-- it's-- you just HAVE to try it. The cheese curds: now, I'm no French cheese genius, but the cheese curds are good here too. (Disclaimer: I actually can't tell the difference between good cheese curds and great cheese curds. I only know if it's good or bad and Patati Patata hits the spot). The price: Cheap and I love it. Writing this review makes me homesick for their mouthwateringly delicious poutine and the plateau vibes. Maybe I'll see you guys there soon :\")\n",
      "Our first experience noshing on poutine, the wonderful mess of fried potatoes, cheese, and gravy. This is a total corner grub hub so don't expect bistro or some other French-tinged dining experience. Probably all of 15 diners can fit into the cramped - yet historical feeling - room. There is a L-shaped diner-style eating area that wraps around the cook's area. On this warm afternoon, we heard two German teachers yapping it up over beers and burgers. Some French locals were behind us eating and talking animatedly as well. Love the fact that this is about 3 blocks away from the Central Park of Montreal (can't recall the name of the park but it occupies a large chunk of the Montreal landscape). Also the street that it's on, Boulevard Saint Laurent, is full of local culture, especially the further you get away from the downtown area.\n",
      "Such good poutine! The gravy is vegetarian which is a plus for me. Perfect portion, perfect prices. They serve beer and other things such as tofu burgers, real burgers, borcht, etc. It's very, very, busy during evenings or late night Thursday, Friday , Saturday... so expect that you're not going to find a table when you stumble in from your weird university clubbing night out. That being said, during the week it's reasonable to find a spot to sit and the people who work there are nice and work hard.\n",
      "Nice cumfy place, perfect for a midnight fast food craving. The people are passionate and the food is good.\n",
      "The best part about this place is the staff. The foods good too though. As a vegan it's hard to find places that cater to me and meat eaters. I got the vegan breakfast plate and it was perfect. After, the staff chatted with us and gave great recommendations on what to do while we were here.\n",
      "Patati......let me count the ways that I love thee. I used to live around the block from this joint and made a weekly visit. This tiny place is unique and delicious, at times it can be packed solid, but I've never minded waiting a few minutes to grab a table. The boys behind the counter are always extremely accommodating, offering up a beverage while you wait. I usually get the tofu stir fry, which comes with a huge salad and fries for only $6! it's great to see a place offering several vegan options, as they are few and far between in the land of smoked meat.\n",
      "I came 15 minutes before close but because the dirty hipster couldn't process orders from the group in front of me in time I wasnt able to order. At that point everything else around was closed. I have never experienced such pathetic service, but such is Montreal. I would never go back not recommend. Find a better alternative for cheap food.\n",
      "This little hole in the wall is a DEFINITE MUST TRY at the St Laurent Blvd area. The Cheeseburger with bacon burger slider was very moist and juicy. Poutine was the best we ever had and the desserts are AMAZING!!! It was our first time to try the Rein Elisabeth which is a sweet date cake with a nice frosting... It was so good; My husband was still looking for it the next morning!!! Their brownie is VERY decadent; very well done, Patati Patata... You've made new fans here!! It's in the same strip as Schwartz but trust me.. You won't regret coming here!\n",
      "best Poutine. Nice staff at the Portuguese quartier of rue saint Laurent. Very good.\n",
      "Just a warning, you will never be able to sit down. ever. Comfort aside, this place is great, vegan and vegetarian friendly, good ethics, cute spot. Really nice in the summer to stop in and get a snack, then eat in the park across the street. There is a lot of pushing, complaining and long lines at PatatiPatata, but that's only because it's good. Everyone gets served...eventually.\n",
      "I really don't know what is the big deal about the poutine in this place. Honestly I had better - considering the price and the taste, I think McDonald poutine (when they had it back in Vancouver) is better value. Now the burgers... I dont know about this mustard - it's not subtle at all - It's way too overpowering considering meat to bun ratio. In this case, I think I would opt to eat five guys instead. Good try though. Luckily we got sandwiches from omnivore at the same time so... We were satisfied overall that night with our choice of food.\n",
      "Le service est vraiment horrible. Celui qui prépare le budger encaisse l'argent, ne se lave pas les mains et touche à la viande à la nourriture après avoir fumé sa cigarette. J'étais sidérée. Personne ne porte de gants et il se tripote la barbe sur le comptoir sans filet bien sur. Cest vraiment dégueulasse sans parler de la salade sans sauce et des frites froides que j'ai eu. Je ne remettrai plus les pieds la bas et faites attention à pas attraper une cochonnerie en mangeant la bas\n",
      "I have been here a couple times to take out food and once now to sit down. Really like this place for a cheap bite! Food: really good, they definitely don't skimp on portion size and it's really good comfort food. I've had burgers, poutine, and sandwiches here and have enjoyed everything I've tried here so far. Service: really fast for a small place with three guys working it. When you sit down, there's little interaction but that's to be expected. If it's busy, there's a park nearby to sit down and eat at. Price: cheap and worth it. Great value and makes a good quick dinner solution. Easily can finish under $10 with a large BLT, salad, fries. Ambiance: looks cute and very local feeling. Sitting down in such a small space is tight but nice in the summer with the windows open.\n",
      "Such a small place but such big flavor. The service was prompt, the hamburger was fresh not frozen, the fries crispy just the way I like them and the salad well it's a salad I was there for the poutine. The gravy was extremely tasty and the cheese was just enough without it over riding the dish. Good times, good food and super service. We will be back.\n",
      "The poutine here was ultimately delicious: really beefy gravy, really fresh (and delightfully squeaky) cheese curd, REALLY crispy fries. I was probably too amused that my 32-oz serving of beer came in an adorable demi pitcher that belongs in a dollhouse.\n",
      "Not bad. Good value for money, but wouldn't be running back. We tried a burger, a fish burger and a tofu burger. Tofu burger was an interesting concept but didnt thrill me. The best was the fish burger.\n",
      "The restaurant is small but good. All the staff were very friendly and price was reasonable. I just ordered one classic poutine to go. The food was made freshly and gravy was hot enough to melt the cheese curd. However, it seemed to be a little salty for me. Maybe it was not my dish. I preferred some kind of creative-style poutine~ I found that many customers chosen their burger. It looks good too.\n",
      "Came here to try their poutine but was impressed more with their burgers. The poutine looked beautiful and was prepared very well though. The burger patties they pack are small and reminiscent of a McDonald's burger in size and shape (thickness) but were seasoned well, of good quality meat and cooked perfectly also. I've never had a burger this way (and after all, its just a hamburger) but I was surprised and rather delighted nonetheless. They give you a list of toppings that you check off on like an order sheet which was pretty handy. Place is tiny and has a lot of character. Definitely a fun, quick stop when navigating around this beautiful city.\n",
      "The poutine is delicious, but the staff really made it for us. We were five tourists, very unsure of what we wanted to order, and taking up a lot of space in this small diner. Instead of being impatient with us, the waiters found us five seats together and talked us through all the menu. We just loved it here.\n",
      "If a friend is visiting from out of province, take them here to show them real Québécois poutine. Rather than just a pile of fries, gravy and cheese curds, the poutine is balanced and is treated like a real dish, not as just an after-drinks carb. The atmosphere is artsy and local music festivals are always on the walls. The space is quite small though, but nearby parks make it great for take out picnics if the weather permits. Pricing is also perfect for the high quality of poutine you get.\n",
      "After our friends showed us this little spot we couldn't get enough! Ate here 3 days in a row because their burgers were THAT good. $3 for a delicious burger, you really can't beat it! Their iced tea is a must try as well and only $1.75!! Tried their poutine for lunch one day and to be honest i'm not too fond of it. The cheeses curds were felt very rubbery and i could hear eat bite like rubber rain boots rubbing against each other. But I still highly highly recommend getting their regular burger and you can enjoy it in their store (if there's room) or at the park across the street!\n",
      "Went there two weeks ago because I was extremely hungry and I remember a lot of people talked to me about it so I gave it a try. I took a burger and a Poutine, the burger was alright.. Poutine wad good but not the best I have tasted. To be honest I expected more because of the hype but it is still a great place to eat, I would definitely recommend to people if they are hungry. Place is not big by the way it's really tight and it feels like you are talking to everyone at the same damn time. The employees are very nice and they definitely treat you with respect, I was also facing the chef so I could see what he was doing which was cool. But yea give it a try guys !\n",
      "Lost my poutine virginity here...loved it! Could be eating their poutine all day long, but particularly great if you're looking for comfort food after a cold, tiring day. Burger was awesome as well - small, simple but delicious. The whole meal + a drink was only $12 CAD. Would come back for the tofu burger another day.\n",
      "The burgers here are like little flavour bombs! You can't eat just one. The restaurant is a tiny hole in the wall with very limited seating. If you eat in they will bring your order to your table. You can also order beer! Ordering is simple, if you get a burger you are handed a small paper with the various toppings offered. You write down your name and check off what toppings you want and then pay for your order. The wait is usually pretty fast (about 5-10 minutes) considering they're always very busy! I always eat at the park across the street since seating is tight and the restaurant gets really hot with all the bodies inside. The poutine was also good but a little too salty. Seriously, the burgers are all you need to fall in love with Patati Patata. The location is also great for a post or pre-drinks snack, with tons of bars within walking distance. Service is friendly. I'm not sure about parking since I always just uber or walk here.\n",
      "Had a Great time ! The place was small lots of ppl quick service Staff is friendly Nice spot to eat with friends and kill time\n",
      "I'm from Halifax and I have sworn that I had the best poutine at a small fry cart in northern New Brunswick. I can say, THIS is the best poutine of all time. Nothing can or will trump this. The fries are perfectly crispy, the gravy is savoury and not too salty. Of course, the perfect pairing to poutine is beer and a burger. These burgers are sliders but damn good. I live in Ottawa now and every time I pass through Montreal (once a month) I have to stop by here\n",
      "My family and i (a group of 5) came here for the poutine. enroute to the international fireworks competition at la ronde... while there is a lot of choices on the menu--burgers, tofu, salads... only 2 of poutine. i digress...each time we visit montreal we try to sample poutine from as many palces as possible (avoiding the fast food joints and sticking to the mom and pop places). so this go round we chose patati and we were happy with the poutine, but it was a small portion of very simple style poutine. while i'm not sure one needs a huge portion of poutine...it was only 4$ (canadian) but it hit the spot. our favourite poutine joint is still madam baldouc--they have the best selection and 2 sizes (large and larger). it was worth the trip to patati patata and exploring the avangart neighborhood...a bit of rock and roll meets hipster canadian style. good blonde ale as well. and good service from friendly guys behind the counter.\n",
      "Food: 3/3 Service/ambiance: 1/2 The food here was very good. Also, the cost for the amount of food you get is great! They really pack your plate. Staff are very friendly, my only minus is that the place is cramped and can't hold many, but either wise, I was very satisfied with this place.\n",
      "This is a great neighborhood poutine shop. A pretty extensive menu - I had the poutine with roast beef - it was well priced albeit a bit basic. It was tasty with the most cheese curds of the four places we tried while we were in town. The regular poutine was delicious as well, thin cut fries with light grave and white curds. It's not fancy, not big inside, so plan to wait for a seat. On a Tuesday at noon, we were able to get seated right away but it probably gets busy. They have a couple of beers on tap and the prices are right. The servers was friendly and super fast. We also appreciated that he helped us find the nearest bus route for our next adventure.\n",
      "Petite friterie qui vaut absolument le détour! Acceuil très sympa et sans façons. Les frites sont meilleures que dans la plupart des friteries en Belgique! La poutine, extra (demandez toutefois à ce qu'elle ne soit pas trop salée). Très bons hamburgers à composer soi-meme.\n",
      "Stopped at this small corner shop based on the reviews I read before visiting Montreal. We ordered the regular poutine, palatine (poutine with mushrooms and red peppers) and their homemade ice tea. One of the best poutines I've had so far. Good portions of food and the cheese curds are tasty. The service was friendly, and I was satisfied by the food. I would have rated it 5, but because I was asked to tip, I gave it four stars. A tip is an option; you shouldn't be pushed to do !!\n",
      "Best Poutine we had on our trip!!! This is a must!!!! Cruchy fries, awesome gravy and the curds were to die for!\n",
      "The congested space makes it difficult to devour a hearty poutine, otherwise take-outs don't sound bad.\n",
      "My favourite poutine in Montreal! The place is very small is you will most likely have to wait a while to be seated but it will be worth the wait! Every time I come to town I have a beer and poutine. They serve it with an olive on top!\n",
      "A staple in my burger and fries diet. Also has amazing breakfast and coffee, and vegetarian curry. Totally affordable too!\n",
      "I love this place. $3 burgers + combo makes it $5 + tax and tip. You'd think a tiny burger wouldn't fill you up, but the fries are so good. Plus their salad makes you feel less guilty when you're engulfing the burger. Try their house dressing, it's to die for. Don't go during rush hour, it'd be a pain to wait for a seat. There's a park on the corner of Rachel and St. Laurent, so you can always order to-go and have a spontaneous picnic!\n",
      "We came here to try the poutine, which some of us realized we aren't quite fans of though the French fries were delicious! But what was extremely good and I'll never forget is the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice I had! Five stars for that! The guy we ordered from recommended it and it was the first time I was ever offered to have both mixed together. I wish I could have another glass right now. It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too sour and was just the perfect refresher after the long walk we'd had.\n",
      "This is a great little diner. The food is good and cheap, and the service is fast. I had the Luke Special* which is a western omelette sandwich, fries and a coffee. I paid $5 and a few coins for the filling and delicious meal. I'm not surprised that this place boasts a big line-up. Patati Patata is great! * Author's note: I've since forgotten the name of it. I'm pretty sure it's called that.\n",
      "This place is so cute and cool. It is really tiny (sits maybe about 10 people in total), but it's more of a take-out place. The atmosphere is very casual place. Their menus are written on the wall, and you seat yourselves. The outside looks like something out of a comic book. So cool. It's open late so it's perfect for grabbing a late dinner or snack. I got the tofu burger with fries and a salad. The burger was $2.50, and the fries and salad was $4. Really good price for a meal. The food wasn't the best, but it was definitely worth $6.50.\n",
      "A tiny place for the best poutine in town. Forget the popular \"poutineville\" or the classic tourist famous \"la banquise\", and just run there. The rest of the meal are not crazy but still a great place to have breakfast or lunch.\n",
      "I love coming to Patati Patata whenever I'm visiting Montreal! The place is very quaint and small, but when you are able to grab a seat by the window or the bar, enjoy the small details that the place offers. You can definitely find one of the best classic poutine here! The fries are freshly made (thinner than normal, which I prefer) and the portion of fries/gravy/cheese is simply perfect!! I'm drooling as I'm writing this...\n",
      "Dropped by this restaurant for breakfast and was highly satisfied. The place itself is quite smal. There might be enough room for maximum 15 people to eat in at once. When the weather is nice, there's always a line up to get it - always a good sign! My meal was great. I appreciated that there was an option for vegans. I enjoyed my coffee as well. The prices were beyond reasonable, as were the portions. Most importantly, the service was excellent. I informed our server about my allergies, and he even went as far as wiping down the ketchup bottle to avoid any cross contamination. Additionally, my coffee cup was never empty. I was beyond impressed. All in all, good food, great service, and a cozy environment - highly recommended!\n",
      "NOTE: An American reviewing a Canadian Eatery This is was our 1st stop as soon as we landed in Canada and wasn't part of our original plan, though a very pleasant surprise. Parking: Street parking is available for a nominal fee. We paid $0.25 Canadian and we received 14hrs worth of parking. Admittedly, we may have paid $2.00 since we are new to the currency so prices/hr may vary. Ambiance: **** (4 stars) So say this place was small would be an overstatement. I've been in master bathrooms with more seating compacity. That said, this place had an eclectic, punk rock atmosphere to it. Since the primary language in the area is French, we were both SUPER intimidated, but the people behind and in front of the counter were inviting and helpful. Also note, the menu posted on the walls are in French so if you don't read French just ask. We took our order to go since seating was limited and only got Poutine (obviously) and a Tofu Burger. Poutine: **** (4 stars) Not knowing the difference between good and bad poutine, we really enjoyed what we consumed. There are many different variations of poutine you can purchase here but we went with 2 classic versions for our first time. One plain and one with ground sausage. Fries used in the poutine were excellent in size, similar to McDonalds fries, and were crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The gravy used was flavorful and thick enough to stick to the fries without making them soggy. The cheese curds were plentiful and were around to provide texture and chew more than actual flavor. We would come back to try other variations and combos. Tofu Burger: *** (3 stars) Out of left field but it was recommended to us by a woman waiting to be seating. I would qualify this more as a sandwich with burger toppings than an actual burger. The \"burger\" was small. The bread used was a quarter part of french baguette, buttery and crusty. A good foundation. The condiments included mayo, tomato, red onion, grain mustard. The star of the show was the 2 chunks of marinated tofu used. They seemed to have a light curry flavor to them and the density of the tofu was a new experience to the both of us. All in all the \"burger\" was an experience and very enjoyable, but nothing we would be craving for back in the States. Overall: **** (4 stars) As our 1st official Poutinerie, Patati Patata has set the bar pretty high. The vibe of the place was electric and all the patrons were eating and smiling. Don't be intimidated by the French menu, the people behind the counter are more than willing to help. The food was fresh, flavorful, and inventive. Give it a try! - Kev/Mag\n",
      "I really enjoy this little resto on St. Laurent. It is cozy on a frigid day and offers cute slider tofu burgers for cheap. Their poutine is very good and the price is always right. Try it out!\n",
      "C'est dans cette petite friterie de quartier que j'aurai gouté ma premiere (et sûrement pas la dernière) poutine. Me voilà convertie!\n",
      "My first time in Montreal and trying poutine was a must. After much research on my fav foodie site, Yelp of course, Patati Patata was in my crosshairs. Now, I am biased, I needed to find a veggie friendly poutine. I was with locals and they were a bit skeptical of this variation. However, the fries, gravy, and cheese curds were delicious and just left you wanting more! The saltiness of the fries and richness of the gravy balanced out nicely with the mild tasting cheese curds. The place is absolutely tiny, so if you can't get a table, order to go. There is a nice little park across the street and you can dine al fresco if it's not too icy cold. Thanks Patati for my first taste of your native specialty, poutine!\n",
      "This diner has a huge all-day breakfast menu, but I always order their burger with cheese and an order of fries, except for one time in which I ordered the Special Luc sandwich- good, but is not as good as the burger. You're given a small piece of paper to indicate what you'd like to include in the burger. The burger is somewhat small but is just the perfect size paired with an order of fries. The fries are cut small and twice fried, which gives you the extra crunch that goes perfectly well with their made to order burger. This small joint is always busy and yet somehow you can always get a seat after a short wait. If you want fresh air, order to go and eat at the small park right across the street.\n",
      "Cet endroit est parfait pour quand: 1. Tu as faim 2. Tu veux manger une foutue bonne frite 3. T'es pauvre Les employés sont super gentils, t'appellent par ton nom même si tu leur a pas dit c'était quoi, et vont te servir une des meilleurs patates grasses de Montréal. On y couvre tous les classiques du fast food mais avec une qualité inégalée, avec de la bière pas chères et des desserts à mourir. Ils font aussi une énorme poutine aux légumes grillés, la Patatine, avec du fromage parfait, des légumes parfaits et une sauce brune parfaite. Pour 4$, vas-y, gâtes-toi.\n",
      "I am not an expert of poutine and I came here because people kept saying it's the place for best poutine in Canada. I doubted but I was very happy with my meal. I love that they put a lot of veges in poutine so that it will be less unhealthy. Guys at this place who served my poutine were so cute and friendly.\n",
      "This was my first poutine experience in Montreal. Lots of people hate on poutine but I thought fries, gravy and cheese curds would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, given such an easy-win list of ingredients this just wasn't that good. Maybe I don't like poutine (I don't know; again, given those ingredients I don't know how it could be anything but awesome) or maybe this place isn't that good as far as poutine goes. Either way, something lacking here.\n",
      "I loved this place, the poutine was really good, service was fast and friendly, and I didn't expect the huge salad! It's very inexpensive, too.\n",
      "After trying to eat here for a few times, I finally got into the restaurant without having to lineup outside. I got a bacon cheese burger and poutine for 11 something dollars, which is ok pricing. The burger had the size of a slider. You know the little round bread you get in big packages at costco? Yeh, I fear that is the bread they use. The meat patty fit well into the bun, which means it's probably the size of a 1.59$ mcdonald's hamburger patty. Except, it was well cooked and tasty. So...it's kind of worth the 2.75$ basic burger + 0.65$ cheese + 0.65$ bacon? You tell me. When I inquired about the poutine, two ladies at the counter vouched for it. The portion was ok, just enough to keep me interested throughout (I get bored real quick). The gravy was very salty, but had a particular taste (that I can't seem to place, probably because of the beer I had priorly), perhaps mushroom based, which differentiates it from a generic gravy. There was a bit too much cheese however, in terms of proportion. My last bites mainly consisted of unmelted cheese. But it does go 'squeak squeak' when I chew hahaha. I'm not a particular fan of their fries, which is sad to say, because I'd assume a restaurant calling itself 'Patati Patata' would have a great potato recipe. They were crispy but brown (gives off a bitter taste) on the outside and thinly cut so the resulting fries are rather dry (not enough of interior fluffy content). Purely in terms of taste, I'd give 4/5 for the burger, 3/5 for the poutine. Can someone, who's not a tourist eating poutine for the first time, explain to me what I am missing out?\n",
      "About as good a plate of poutine as you're going to find. The service was friendly and worked with a rare energy to feed the throngs. I lucked out and got a table, but you should be prepared to get your food to go and eat outside.\n",
      "I had Patati Patata on my list of \"must try\" places in Montreal and I STILL managed to walk right past it earlier in the day without noticing it. Patati Patata is super small (I can't imagine it seating more than 15 people) and unobtrusive, but it is fantastic. You can opt to sit at the counter or one of three or four tables. I wouldn't recommend this place for parties of more than two - you're going to have a very hard time finding some configuration so you can sit together. I saw lots of people getting takeout from the counter (fill your order in on little slips of paper, hand it over, wait briefly, receive cheap delicious food, hand over coins rather than bills (oh, Canada!), and go). Patati Patata served up the best poutine I had in Montreal (though granted, I only had it twice) with onions and green peppers for $4. Amazing. Even MORE amazing, 10 oz. beers were $2.50. Even with the waning exchange rate advantage, that's awesome! The staff is a little brusque (they're super busy) but also nice. One of the counter guys offered the girls behind me free beer because he had to change the taps. They were drinking the red, and I had the blonde so I got no free beer. Drat. I will say Patati Patata is not a place to linger. There was a line out the door on the Thursday evening I went (it seemed to be mostly university students) so I finished as quickly as I could. Before I was even to the register, my seat had been snatched, but I think that's more a testament to how good this place is than anything else.\n",
      "J'ai découvert le Patati Patata grâce à des amis. On y avait rendez-vous pour manger. C'est un chouette petit endroit, et quand je dis petit, c'est vraiment petit, 2 ou 3 tables pour 2 personnes, un table où on peut tenter d'être 4 et le comptoir. Donc n'y venez pas pour un repas à 8. On mange sur le pouce des supers bons petit burgers et une très bonne patatine (poutine améliorée de la maison). Une bonne adresse, pas chère et conviviale. J'y retournerai !\n",
      "The best! Me and my boyfriend were visiting Montreal for the first time, we ended up eating here twice! Both times we got the burger w/ poutine And salad combo. Such a perfect balanced meal and a great price! The customer service was awesome too, very friendly and helpful!\n",
      "This was the perfect spot for me when I was working until 10pm and commuting home across town. I'd drop by here with an appetite big enough to cause a disturbance in the Force, and just squeak in before the 11pm closing time (they've since extended those hours). I'd trundle in, covered in a disgusting layer of sweat from sprinting on my bike to make it in time. Fish burger assiette, s'il-te-plait. Poutine, salade. Meanwhile, you can watch a paltry staff of two fill all the orders in fascination in a tiny shoebox of a kitchen while you sit at the bar, contemplating life, and being baptized by the oily fumes wafting in your face. Please don't ever change, Patati.\n",
      "1 star not for the food experience but the service my fiancée and I received from the bearded guy at the register, not only wasn't he welcoming ( the way he spoke to us had a vibe of \"don't stay here, we have other people coming\" but at the end he overcharged me by almost 10 dollars, I noticed the mistake once I got out, came back and confronted him. He acted as if it wasn't his fault but ultimately admitted to the mistake and I got my money back. Food was delicious but I won't come back because of that prick. The other two guys were super cool.\n",
      "This place served my first ever plate of poutine, and it was AWESOME. I also got a burger and a couple of beers. The prices were crazy cheap, at least way cheaper than what I'm used to. I think I left about $15 lighter and 5 lbs heavier, I can't complain except for that amount of time I had to spend at the gym to work off those calories! The staff is very friendly and I thought it was located in a pretty cool area.\n",
      "C'est bien, pas plus. Recommandation d'Évelyne Audet. J'ai encore mangé de la poutine. Rien de spécial. Je suis parti de Côte-des-Neiges pour aller à ce resto. Ça ne valait pas la peine. Par contre, le menu autre que le fast-food est intéressant. Je dirais plus bistro.\n",
      "Dropped in while walking up St-Laurent. Can't say enough about the hot dog ( maybe the best I've ever had), delicious fries and cold Boreal. Service was outstanding. Great neighborhood with people watching galore. A must visit.\n",
      "We came here on a friends recommendation to try out the Poutine. This cute little restaurant has limited seating but the server was really good at juggling people around and also very nice to us. We were seated in about 15 minutes. We ordered the patatine which is a vegetarian poutine, and a couple of burgers on the side. The burgers are more like sliders and really cheap as well. I ordered the tofu burger and got a really filling piece for under 3$. The poutine itself was way better than what I tried once in the US so I was glad I ordered it. The crowd was mostly local and the menu is in French but everyone speaks English and people were very friendly and helpful. Metered parking on the street which is as good as it gets for Montreal.\n",
      "I've been going to Patati Patata for years and I never get sick of it! For around 8$ you can eat a satisfying, tasty meal in a timely fashion. The atmosphere is cosy and the service is friendly. Can't say enough good things!\n",
      "This place is wonderful. The definition of \"hole-in-the-wall,\" really. There are only several seats and if you go at prime dinner hours the line is out the door, but I have to say the food is worth the wait. The poutine is some of the best I've had in Montreal, but my favorite thing to order here is the Mediterranean Burger. It has feta on it, with a special tzatziki/mint sauce that is delicious. The burgers are small, made with fresh ingredients, and the fries are perfectly done. Their salad dressings are homemade and are also very good. They have a breakfast menu as well, but I have never tried anything off of it. If you haven't been, it's a definite spot to hit! Oh yes, and it's cheap - you can get a burger, fries, and salad for $6. I don't think it gets much better than that.\n",
      "This is a super small restaurant. It is good to take your food and go across to the street, weather permitting. The poutine is really good.\n",
      "First poutine in Montreal. Wasn't too bad, the service was great though. We had just poutine, fries were good, lots of cheese, and good sauce. It just wasn't perfect.\n",
      "Great hole in wall... 1st time i ever had poutine and was excellent!!!\n",
      "Best poutine we had in Montreal. Much better than another famed place (*cough* Resto La Banquise *cough*). Good gravy, good fries, tasty cheese. Our curds didn't squeak, so take that for what it's worth to you. Tip: get the poutine with the peppers and mushrooms. There's only a couple, but it's the same price ($6 something), and it's delicious. If the weather's nice, go enjoy it in the park across the street.\n",
      "Little cheeseburger slider with salad and fries: A. Side of poutine: B. No squeaks to be had, and the gravy was a bit thin. Fries were excellent. Really liked the quick, friendly service and the whole set up.\n",
      "A tiny place, but absolutely brilliant! Tiny burgers made to order by hand, excellent poutine, and even borscht! And it's cheap! A perfect place for lunch in the city. It was recommended to me on a recent visit to Montreal by somebody who follows me on Twitter (a McGill alumna), and it was a fantastic call. I'll be going back next time I'm up that way!\n",
      "Great prices, tasty burgers, fries and poutine. For the record, my only other experience with poutine was in Toronto and I was totally underwhelmed. The poutine at this place is completely different and much better. The burgers are slider size, so if you get a burger with fries and salad, you won't be stuffed. I'll definitely return next time I'm in the area.\n",
      "My boyfriend and i wanted to try a new poutine place so we stepped in and ordered. The man asked us if we wanted to sit down or take out. Since it was 11:30pm we figured we'd probably take some home anyways. We asked to have in a to go box but we would sit there to eat; less dishes to do and more environmentally friendly. \"Could we have it to go but eat here instead?\" \"Thats exactly what i dont want. Its only for here or take out.\" With that tone of voice, i'm boycotting that place and he will never take a dime from me. Ive done customer service for 10 years and thats surely not how you make clients feel welcome. I guess im better off giving my money to a poutine place that actually deserves it before acting all pretentious.\n",
      "Finally found THE go-to place for a quick cheap bite at anytime of the day, on St-Laurent. They open late too! As a regular customer, I usually go for two burgers- the beef burger and the tofu burger. Both are great. You can choose add-ons on your burger, as the staff will hand you a sheet to mark what you want. The burgers are small but they are inexpensive. Be aware that the buns are ciabatta buns - if you're an avid fan of brioche buns. I've tried the potato fries once and they are great! Now, the atmosphere of the restaurant. A very \"plateau\" vibe with good service. Note that the restaurant is very small, but size does not matter here. The customers usually go for a quick meal, but it's always better to take-out. However, if you do take-out, you might have to wait a while before getting your food. The kitchen is doing what they can to get your food as fast as possible but you will have to wait.\n",
      "Honestly I always wanted to try this place and was disappointed....I ordered a poutine to go and honestly you don't get much for $5.16 after 4 bites its gone sauce nothing special....oh yeah maybe its the olive they put on top that costs a fortune!!\n",
      "someone once aptly described the poutine situation in Montreal to me as such: \"drunk teenagers from Ontario go to La Banquise and men from Quebec go to Patati Patata\" its true. this place rules. of course I dont eat poutine or meat, but I go for their amazing tofu sliders.\n",
      "Is this poutine heaven or is this real life? I wish it was a big restaurant rather than a tiny diner so I can eat there more often.\n",
      "Disclaimer: This review is based on two vastly different experiences that I've had with the poutine here. The first time I had it was for takeout a little under a year ago, and unfortunately, it was pretty awful. While the fries were deliciously crisp and held the gravy and cheese curds well, the gravy was so salty and olive-y that I couldn't even finish it. I swore I would never go there again, but out of curiosity, I decided to give it another chance. When I went there recently, I decided to eat in, and upon first bite, it actually tasted really good. Perhaps it was because I was famished, but I finished off the whole plate without losing my appetite. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the gravy, when put on a plate, has more room to spread out and evenly distribute itself among the fries than when it's just sitting on top of them in a box, but it had a unique flavor to it that made it quite addictive. I left feeling very satisfied and content with my experience. So, long story short, it's probably best to eat Patati Patata's poutine inside, as it will be much tastier, easier to digest, and feel less like salt overkill than if you take it to go.\n",
      "This was my go-to breakfast spot while on my mini get-away. I was recommended this place by a friend and it did not disappoint. Food and service were superb! Customer service was excellent - the guys were so nice and friendly. The price of the food were acceptable - not dirt cheap but not ridiculously expensive - I'd say it's averagely priced. While the place is a bit small, the vibe of the restaurant is great. Only complaint - although I did not bring it to their attention - was that my last meal there had a long thick black hair tangled in my bacon (if you zoom into my picture - you can see the strand of hair over the eggs, orange and bacon on the right) :( I'm not easily grossed out and I know this happens so I let it pass. All in all - great cute place on a budget. Will definitely come by again when I'm back in Montreal!\n",
      "So, at first you see its small. If they're busy, its crowded and a small line leads out front. EVEN with that against us, we waited and ordered and MAN was it worth it. First, the gentleman who took our order was friendly and courteous. He helped us decide on our food since it was our first time there. We ended up with a small variety that included the poutine and their Mediterranean Burger. BOTH WERE DELICIOUS! If you are in the area, make sure you try the Poutine..it really is that good!\n",
      "La Poutine est très bonne, fait de frites fraîches, mais il faut définitivement la prendre pour emporter.\n",
      "Amazing place.. Even though the burger was WAY too small it rivals the counter in LA and my favorite burger. The poutine is pretty tasty as well. It is a VERY VERY small place and you will prob have to wait a bit to get a seat but great atmosphere and food.\n",
      "Petite (c'est le cas de le dire) friterie très colorées mais avec des frites et burgers d'exceptions. Déjà en rentrant avec mon amie on a commencé a parler avec les 3 cuistots et on a bien rit pendant 5 min. On a ensuite passé la commande et payé. On était servi dans les 5 min. Leurs frites sont vraiment excellentes, les burgers (avec du pain frais) sont très bon et le thé glacé hyper rafraîchissant. Si vous vous promenez/magasinez sur St Laurent et que vous avez une petite fringale n'hésitez pas surtout que pour un bon repas vous vous en sortirez pour moins de 7$.\n",
      "My husband and I decided to get married in Las Vegas and we started our search with where we stayed for our first trip to Las Vegas together; Caesars Palace. We got our information from Caesars Wedding Services (JoAnn) and did a little further research at other venues (Mandalay Bay, Wynn, Bellagio). We decided to use Caesars Palace as our ceremony venue and we are SO thrilled with our decision. Caesars Wedding Services have a wide variety of wedding packages available for all types of groups coming to Vegas for nuptials, and we chose the Cleopatra package and the Juno Garden to accommodate 85 guests. Rebecca Profitt was our coordinator and she was very attentive and friendly, and very timely with email and phone response. She was so on top of everything the day of and we did not have to worry about a single thing. We did opted out of having a rehearsal but because Rebecca was so on top of everything and communicating the details to all parties involved in the ceremony, I did not worry for a second. Our day was so beautiful and perfect and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. Honorable mention for Rev. Brian Ross. We got SO many compliments on how great he was at the ceremony and how much everyone enjoyed him. I also really appreciated his playful manner and humor while I was in the midst of taking huge cleansing breaths in the bridal holding room waiting for the ceremony to start. Thanks for making our wedding day so amazing, Caesars Wedding team!\n",
      "We had our wedding 11/12/2106 in the Venus gardens. The wedding was more than I could have ever dreamed of. It was beautiful. Our wedding planner was fantastic. It was so easy to plan I couldn't have been happier. Of course a little pricey but what do you expect it's Caesars palace in last Vegas. Also with my package my hair and makeup was included and I would highly recommend them to anyone they did an incredible job!!\n",
      "My husband and I got Married in the Juno Gardens on 3/21/15. We decided to go with Caesars because the packages were reasonable and I knew I wanted an outdoor venue and the Venus garden was lovely! It is by the pool but set back far enough that we didn't notice pool nice- even during Spring Break. I'd like to think I was a very laid back bride and was overall ver happy with the communication from our wedding coordinator! Our package included a flower credit and photo credit. The flowers were a little price but looked great and the photos were very professional. We opted not to have the reception at Caesars and there was no pressure from our wedding coordinator to do so. We could have gone a cheaper route but were very happy we ended up at Caesars. Everyone loved the venue and we didn't even add any flower. It was beautiful as is!\n",
      "We had our wedding here last fall in the Juno garden. We chose the Caesars package which included extras such as a limo ride, flower credit, food credit, bridal hair and makeup up, etc... I'd love to say we had a great experience but sadly we didn't. Our planner wasn't as dedicated as they made it sound like she'd be. And she lacked in communication with not only us, but other people responsible for aspects of our wedding. My bouquet while beautiful was outrageously overpriced as well as all the other arrangements. The photographer was amateurish and lacked imagination for poses. The videographer was also amateurish in that they used only one camera so you got only one point of view, the quality of which could easily have been surpassed by any one of my guests. The limo driver, which was supposed to have been cancelled by my planner due to an event that closed down the strip, was not notified his services had been cancelled and had a horrible attitude. Essentially all their contractors were unprofessional and excessively overpriced if you wanted something not included in your package. And if you do not want to use their contractors you have to pay a fee to use your own. Our wedding planner stated she could not help us plan the reception, which was fine as they were two separate events, but when asked for guidance as to who to contact to plan the reception we were essentially told to go to one of their restaurants. We told her we wanted a banquet style reception and were made to believe that the restaurants were our only choice. Come to find out they do have banquet style reception planners, but that was another horrible experience for similar reasons as in this review. The hotel staff while not directly attached to the wedding planning side of the hotel tried to make our stay special and did sweet things to make our stay romantic, but they entered our room multiple times without our permission which made me extremely uncomfortable. Housecleaning even entered our room and removed items after I and my guests had told them that we did not want housecleaning or for them to enter the room. Hotel staff even entered the room after we put the do not disturb sign on the door. They also disrupted us during our \"alone\" time ruining the moment. I booked our entire wedding ceremony and hotel stay with our \"dedicated\" wedding planner, who like I said was not very dedicated or communicative. We ended up being charged what they are saying is a resort fee of $84 without that resort fee being disclosed on any paperwork and that fee was charged after we had checked out and paid our entire bill leaving with a zero balance. We were also charged $200 after checking out with a zero balance, that $200 supposedly being an incidental fee which we had no incidentals. Lastly, at one point we had a pending $275 charge that luckily did not go through, that was also unaccounted for. We told our planner what our budget was and she did not respect it one bit. If anything she was trying to get every last cent she could from us as evidenced by the charges we were charged after everything was said and done. And yes, It was determined that those extra charges were because of the wedding planner. And yes, after making multiple grievances with the hotel and claims with my bank, we were reimbursed the money. Overall very bad experience that made a stressful day even worse and ruined our memories of our special day.\n",
      "Bottom line: If you need a wedding venue in Las Vegas - there are certainly no shortages of them. However, I'll put in my vote for Caesars Palace. I'll start off by saying that originally I had absolutely no desire to get married in Vegas. I had originally determined that Virginia would be the place for us - it's where we live, it's where we met; the hardest part - finding that special spot not only for the wedding, but for the wedding reception. When I couldn't find anything to my liking, I started thinking that perhaps Vegas wouldn't be so bad (it is after all where he proposed to me). I had some friends turn me on to Caesars Palace. Mr. Douglas G helped me set up everything I needed and also put me in contact with others to help me make it an experience I won't forget. Gregg and I wanted simple, no fuss and intimate with family and friends. Caesars had the perfect package - the Bella Luna. Our wedding coordinator, Lindsay was awesome! She guided me through each step usually with just a form to film out or a question to answer (nice and simple the way I like it). On the day of the wedding, she called me to make sure I had everything I needed and helped it all go smooth. The photographer was very professional and took lots of photographs - I can't wait to see them all. As a venue it was perfect, I could not have asked for anything better! Thanks again to Douglas and Lindsay, but also to Irene P for arranging our Friday night pre-wedding festivities, and Sandra B for arranging our wedding dinner. Thank you all for making our wedding weekend no stress and perfect!\n",
      "Nice venue with 3 different chapel sizes to fit the needs and capacity allowance for anyone getting married. Located in the Augustus Tower. It's the newer tower and such a plus is that it has its own valet so if they have room to take your car, you are mere steps and a short elevator or walk up one flight of stairs to the wedding chapel on the 2nd level. Close friends of ours recently picked to renew their vows after 10 years of marriage at Caesars. It was a really nice ceremony, the person officiating the vow renewal & the wedding coordinator did a great job. They do not allow any photography or video during the ceremony but I didnt mind that. You're there to witness an exchange of wedding vows and it should be taken in and held special. No need to be trying to get the photo or video at the expense of missing the ceremony. The chapel was elegant. I cant remember the name of the chapel we were in but it was the biggest one of the 3. It had more chairs, a longer center aisle and had a nice stained glass circular centerpiece that looked great. This larger chapel was the one nearest to Guy Savoy restaurant (2 star Michelin!). There are restrooms on the floor and this particular chapel also had a bridal room right before the entrance. It was a beautiful ceremony in a really nice venue orchestrated by seasoned professionals. I'd say that was a success and recommend it highly to those thinking of taking the plunge there. It was a very memorable ceremony to witness for all my friends & I.\n",
      "I am so pleased that I chose Caesars Palace for my ceremony venue. It really is like getting married in a palace. Its a very grand venue for a Vegas wedding, or for any wedding for that matter. I gor married in the Juno Garden 10/17/13. Planning went ok. I was a little worried how smooth things would run since you only get so much interaction with the coordinator. They work with a lot of weddings and itcan take a while to respond to emails. But on the day of my wedding everything was perfect. The Juno Garden is so elegant on its own, there is no need to spend thousands on floral arrangements like in most venues. Its beautiful as-is. I saved a lot of money having an amazing intimate wedding (60 guests)... that was just as beautiful as any $50,000 wedding. And getting married in Vegas is so much fun! I paid an outside vendor fee and used Joey Allen Photography (way more affordable then the company Caesars uses). It was worth it since I wanted several hours of photography. His websites has his rates. I really recommend CP if you want a no fuss BEAUTIFUL and elegant Vegas wedding.\n",
      "We were just married at the Juno Garden in Caesars Palace. I could not have designed a wedding more perfect for us. Our wedding coordinator, Melissa, made it all so easy.. was like filling out an easy check-box questionnaire and presto..you're done planning with venue, flowers, music, photographer and the whole bit.. done. The venue was absolutely beautiful and the whole ceremony was perfectly efficient. Our 80 family and friends were stunned and loved it. Just perfect.\n",
      "I just had my wedding here in the Venus Garden. Valerie Thornton was my first contact. She was helpful and got our package set up, but was slightly less responsive once we had our package booked. Then Rebecca Proffitt was our wedding coordinator. She won't really get in touch with you until about 4 weeks or less before your wedding, but she does respond within about 24 hours. The grounds are beautiful, the minister was great, the pianist was great and the photographer was also pretty good. While this place is definitely a wedding mill -- and every single thing adds up, I still would have it here again. The weather was perfect, Rebecca was very sweet, and the place just has a very intimate and romantic feel to it. I had my wedding in December, so I can't speak to loud music at the pool area (which is right behind the garden) because no one was in the pool in December, but that could be an issue if you choose to have your wedding during the warmer seasons. It might also be irritating to walk around the pool area (you have to walk through the pool area to get to the garden) with all the wet puddles on the ground from people splashing around. This, again, wasn't a factor for me because it wasn't pool season during my wedding. I'd highly recommend this place for a wedding in the winter. Still very temperate and beautiful, and we also got a deal with the pricing since it's low wedding season. The only other thing which isn't particuarly great is that the photography packages are very expensive. The photos did come out pretty good though, so that was a nice surprise. Overall, would recommend as we had a good experience here.\n",
      "I got hitched to Carol W at Caesars Palace. Our ceremony was in the Romano Chapel, a small non-denominational chapel located on the Mezzanine Level of the Augustus Tower. I was told when to show up. I arrived at the chapel on time. The ceremony started promptly at 6pm. It was a short and sweet, but beautifully memorable. The wedding staff at Caesars really made it a seamless process from planning to execution. Lindsay, our wedding coordinator, did an outstanding job! She must've since my bride enjoyed her wedding day, was completely relaxed and far from a \"bridezilla\". Brian, our minister, officiated the service with the proper balance of seriousness and fun. Our photographer, whose name escapes me, was patient, friendly and efficient. Of course, it's not like it was their first rodeo. Although it wasn't our first rodeo, either! There are plenty of wedding chapels to be found in Las Vegas, but the wedding staff and the Romano Chapel at Caesars Palace made our special day stress-free allowing us to just to be able to relax and enjoy it. They were perfect!\n",
      "Of all the hotels my wife and I could've chosen to have our wedding at we chose the Caesar's palace. It has always has been my favorite complex until the way we were treated by their rude vallet staff. Nathan, their head of parking was the first one to greet us with a rude, bad attitude. Even though I explained to him we were getting married there he said that only \"diamond\" guest could get their vehicles vallet by the front entrance with a pretentious demeanour. So there we went towards the back of the building with all our things to move across the entire hotel. The second rude vallet employee Miguel, who worked the area where we were told by him that it was parking only for Limos, was very condescending by telling us that that area was for Limos only, asking, \"do you see any taxis here\"? Even though there was a cab right in front of us and the reason why we walked to that door to beging with. Idiot!! Third, they would not allow our Limo driver from Elite Limos (Awesome by the way!) to park in from of the entrance while we were walking towards it with my family, my wife's family and all if our friends, 45 total. They made him move, when he tried to drive around they yelled at the poor guy and made him park way far from us, forcing us to take a long walk outside in the super hot heat, at 8 pm in the evening!! We were sweating our Arses off!! Exhausting!! We spent a lot of money to get married there and we were treated like we were peasants!! As if they were doing it for free!! Nothing but bad attitudes from people who make most of their living with tips! What the hell happened to good customer service?? The wedding itself thank God went well. But the hotel not only ignored my complaints in regards to their rude staff, but never called us back with any resolution what so ever which shows how little they really care. Our advice, if you are getting married, go to Bellagio, Aria or any other place were they will treat you the way you are supposed to be treated, \"diamond\" members or not, it was our wedding day and my family had to travel from another country to come share this with us, including Family and friends from Michigan and other states. We stayed there four days and brought a lot business, including our relatives and friends who stayed there and spent a lot of money as well. What bothers us the most, is that until this day no one has cared to even try to make any of this right in spite of all the calls I have made and the several \"managers\" I spoken with. The Caesar's Palace staff partially ruined our wedding. Never again, we will stay at your hotel.\n",
      "I reviewed all the venues from Vegas and loved the value and the ratings of Caesar's Palace! The yelp reviews were right, we had an amazing wedding and the venue was beautiful especially in pictures. The staff was calm and knew what they were doing, we didnt even do a rehearsal they just walked you through on the spot. I was not a picky bride and didnt even have flowers other than 4 bouquets... because the venus garden was so amazing on its own. I advise to stay in Palace towers at Caesars because it pops out right at Venus gardens if you get married outside. They offer free indoor weddings if it rains, they answered all my questions and even allowed us to have paper flowers at the venue with no charge. We kept it simple, and we liked it, we didnt add anything or special decor and kept the venue as it was and it was truly amazing. The value was amazing and we toasted in our room with champagne afterwards and went to Trevi to eat in Forum Shops, a perfect wedding. Venus Gardens could have seated 110 people but we had 30 and it still looked full in the pictures! 100% happy cant stop talking about how great it was and how beautiful it was to stay at Caesars!\n",
      "My wife and I were married here by Rev. Brian Ross. We did some research on Las Vegas weddings and really liked the proposal form Caesars. We looked at a number of other venues, and their are lots of options, you can really have any kind of wedding you want in this town. Caesars just checked all our boxes. We really liked the venue here and all the people who helped make it so memorable. Everything was just about flawless, the salon for the ladies, the setting in the garden, the flowers, the music, the dinner after onsite, all spectacular.\n",
      "i have now lost 3 hair dressers to Seattle since i have moved here i don't know what's going on but anyway, that's what got me to salon tru, just moved to Scottsdale, there it was on the corner that i passed every day and finally when even my best hat couldn't hide all my hair, i pulled in for what i fear the most.....a walk-in hair cut......ahhhhhhhh. but what a great experience, large facility, amazing staff, everyone in there could have their own place. just walk in and leave with a great hair cut and hair stylist for life* ** * or until they move to Seattle ** stylist does not actually leave with you\n",
      "Salon Tru has been my place to get my hair cut and colored for years. I have only had great experiences there and highly recommend Colleen and Katina\n",
      "I have been to Julie and Leah now and both did an amazing job on my hair! Love Salon Tru! Aveda products, stylists that make you look amazing, and friendly fun people surrounding you! What's best is that twice now I have called day of and they have accommodated me!\n",
      "I love Misty!!! She is amazing. I went to multiple hair stylists before finding Misty and she does my highlights & lowlights perfectly!!! She is extremely skilled and I have not had a bad hair day since going to her. Thanks Misty!!!\n",
      "Great salon in Old Town. I found this place on yelp and decided to try it out. I called and got an appointment with Lisa. She was so great! She did a whole color consult with me before and showed me color samples and everything. My hair turned out exactly how I wanted it. I'm all about looking like natural blonde.... And I totally do! I was super impressed with the way she did the color.\n",
      "I travel around a lot of business and I always go to Salon Tru when I am in town. I have been to several stylists, including Lisa, Emi and Amanda, and they always take great care of your hair, the scalp massage is amazing, and the front desk is always attentive to all your needs.\n",
      "I am a newbie with getting my hair colored but when I made the decision to color I knew I wanted Aveda products. So I googled and I went to a salon at Town and Country. The stylist was disappointing as she left a streak of brown dye on my forehead with no instruction on how to remove. That was pretty awful. Next time around I decided to try Salon Tru. My stylist was Amanda and I love, love, love her. She is a genuinely sweet person that enjoys making you look beautiful. I love the color of my hair and so appreciated her ability and kindness. I will be returning to Salon Tru and Amanda will be my stylist:)\n",
      "My original rating should have only been meant for the stylist who did my hair and not the salon itself.\n",
      "I followed Misty from her last salon to Salon Tru. Salon Tru has a really nice atmosphere... all the people I encountered were very friendly! Misty is a talented hair stylist. I have long, thick hair and it can be difficult to find someone who can work well with it - Misty has always given me great cuts! I'm past due for a haircut and my hair still has great shape from my last visit. I highly recommend Misty and Salon Tru!\n",
      "Since moving to AZ two years ago, I have been lucky enough to find Kaylee at Salon Tru. She has helped me go from brunette to blonde, and now back to brunette again. She styled my hair for my engagement photos and did my hair for my wedding day. She is a true talented professional, and a sweetheart to boot. The salon is great, and prices are fair for the services you get (and for me, the wine as well!). I like that they don't push the Aveda products on you, even though they're an Aveda salon. My bridal party (5 bridesmaids, 2 moms, a cousin, and myself) all had our hair and makeup done here back in March. I had some very demanding ladies in my group, and not one girl had a negative thing to say about Salon Tru! Would highly recommend you check out Salon Tru (and Kaylee) if you're looking for a new salon.\n",
      "I love salon tru! Great location, products and people. I love Kim Tvetden, she is amazingly talented. I always leave the salon absolutely loving my hair cut and color!\n",
      "I have been looking for a new salon and have decided to try Salon Tru mainly because of the salon's reputation. I scheduled an appointment for a lip and chin waxing and haircut. I have had waxing done by many different salons before and I have to say this was the worst waxing job that I ever had done. 2 days after the treatment the left side of my lip is still swollen and red, it itches, and have red bumps all over. This has never happened to me before. Needless to say the room did not appear very clean and sanitary (the wax holder was dirty, the vent was all dusty, the bulb on the lamp was burned out, and instead of a decent sheet I had to lie down on some sort of a fleece fabric. I was very uncomfortable and now that I think about it I should have just walked out. The experience was so bad that I've decided not to have my hair done at this place. I understand that the wax technician is an independent contractor, but I don't think a reputable salon would or should tolerate such unsanitary conditions. I would never go back or recommend this place to my colleagues or clients.\n",
      "I have been going to salon tru for a few months now. I get my brow waxed by alicia. I am always greeted warmly and Alicia is always very friendly. I am never in there longer than 20 minutes. She is effeciant and very precise. You should try it out if you haven't.\n",
      "I have been going to Allison at Salon Tru for about a year now. She has taken me from Blonde to Brown back to Blonde again. I love my hair every time I walk out of the salon. She takes the time to style it how I want it done. I never have to go home and redo what I just paid for! And, the color remains looking good for a while. She does such a wonderful job - some of my friends have made the switch to going to Allison, now. And, the hand massage is the best/unexpected perk of every hair appointment! I definitely would recommend Allison as a colorist and stylist!\n",
      "Shout out to Tru ly the best salon ever. Awesome job in my hair and a fabulous facial Wendy, the salon manager is so lovely as well. Already booked another facial for next month Go nowhere peeps other than here. Thank you so much\n",
      "I have to give Salon Tru a middle rating, since my experiences there were good at first, but bad the last. I've scheduled with Julie twice, and she does a great job. My third visit, Julie wasn't working, so I scheduled at random with Aimee. My hair is thick, long and I was in to get my layers trimmed. This was my first experience with Amiee -- and it was awkward. Mainly, she seemed unaware and unfocused. It's possible she was having an 'off day', but regardless, I felt uncomfortable. Here are some instances: * After washing my hair, we walked back to her station, and she realized she didn't wash all the shampoo and conditioner out. So we had to return to the sink. There was a stylist next to us who mentioned she was kind of making a mess with the product on the wall and floor. * As she was trimming my hair, it seemed hard for her to focus on the comb and scissors. There was a time when she leaned her arm on top of my head, resting her weight while cutting my hair. I did see her effort to make the cut precise, but I don't think she cut my layers evenly. * When she proceeded to blow dry my hair, she didn't dry in sections. She just blew dry every which way, making my long hair fly everywhere and tangle. I saw pieces of my hair get caught behind the blow dryer. I told her my hair was getting sucked into the back of the dryer, but she was oblivious and didn't respond. When she brushed it, I had knots and tangles. She asked if my hair always did that... I explained to her it would be better to blow dry in sections to prevent tangles. She apologized and said she'll remember that next time, and that she didn't have time to redo it. After my haircut, my hair felt oily from product, messy, and unfinished. I didn't feel like my experience with Aimee was worth $60 plus tip.\n",
      "Just got a hair trim and style by Lisa and really liked it. I'm the type of person who dreads getting their hair cut because i have had so many bad experiences with hairdressers just chopping my hair off. Lisa actually took the time to hear me out and hear what i wanted to do with my hair. SHe left my hair healthy (and still long!). Love the Aveda products especially the damage control line. Great Salon, Decent prices, High Quality merchandise. I think I've found my hair salon in Scottsdale!\n",
      "My favorite stylist Topher Miller recently established himself at this salon. I made my first visit there today and fell in love. The atmosphere is bright and clean. The salon uses Aveda products which fills the air with a fresh, lovely smell...one reminiscent of fresh rain and linen. The location is near restaurants and art galleries. You can \"get pretty\" and then feed your soul. I highly recommend Salon Tru!\n",
      "I made an appointment at Salon Tru with stylist Lisa Kinney after trying a couple of Salons and not liking the results of my color/cut. Upon meeting her she was friendly, knowledgable and very helpful in achieving my desired outcome. She took the time to show me color swatches and find out really what look I desired. Let me just say that the time she took and her experience truly paid off! I loved my hair when I left and still do!!! We managed to achieve the rich chocolate brown with coppery red highlights I had been asking for at previous salons! I will most definately be returning to have her do my hair again!!!!\n",
      "I love my cut and color! It's so hard to get a good cut with thick short hair, but Regina does an amazing job cutting the bulk out in all the right places! Everyone at Tru is super nice and the Aveda products make my hair look and feel healthy, not to mention the salon smells wonderful!\n",
      "I've been coming to Salon Tru for a few years now. For being a top-rated salon, they are so down-to-earth. The reception staff is wonderful. Rachel is great! The salon has a wide variety of services but I go for color, cut and style. Joel is THE MAN! Seriously. If you want awesome color done well, go see Joel! The location is convenient in Old Town Scottsdale. The interior was recently redone in modern refreshing colors. I love Salon Tru!\n",
      "Salon Tru has one of the best stylist in the valley! But first Salon Tru, They always call to remind you about your appointment, when you arrive they are always quick to say hello, ( they call me by my name, that's always nice) and offer you a cold beverage all while letting your stylist know you have arrived. Now back to the main reason for this review, MISTY! Misty has been cutting my hair for 11 years ( 4 salons---Salon Tru being the best)! Misty is so good at her job I talked my wife into seeing her, which is no easy task! What do I know about stylist, I was a super cuts guy before Misty. Now you would think my wife was the one who discovered her. Mistys the best, go see her, tell your wife----\"happy wife happy life\"\n",
      "Update - please be very wary of the Keratin treatment. Within a week of having it done, my hair started falling in clumps. If you have baby fine hair like I do, I'm not sure this treatment is the safest for the hair type. I called the salon twice to talk to a manager about my experience, and could not get someone to return my calls. Disappointing. Anyhow, after a few months, I finally had to chop off about 5 inches of my hair, because the breakage was so bad. I don't fault the stylist, per se, but I think this procedure can be too harsh for fine hair, and I was not happy that two calls to the salon manager were unreturned, even afer I left my name, number, and reason for the call.\n",
      "Wonderful customer service. Front desk attendant, hair stylist and manager checked-in over course of getting hair done. Very professional!\n",
      "I started going to Salon Tru when I moved to Arizona 2 years ago. I worked with Shanna D to get my hair perfect before my wedding day. She did a fantastic job not only leading up to the wedding, but also the day of the wedding. My color stays shinny and vibrant for weeks, and she grew out my hair from short to long, and it is the best it has ever looked. I have never had a facial until about 6 months before my wedding. Alecia has always done an amazing job on waxing my eyebrow's, and decided to start getting monthly facials. I am not addicted. She customizes your facials to you, and my skin is the healthiest it has ever looked. She does an amazing job, and I continue to get facials from her. I don't trust anyone else to touch my skin. They are both great, and would recommend anyone to either Shanna D for hair, or Alecia for any waxing or facial needs!\n",
      "Leah is great! She has been doing my hair for almost a year now and it has improved the quality of my hair. I was going to a salon before that used bleach on my hair and when I asked them to use blonde dye instead they said I wouldn't like it so it's not a good idea. So I decided to try a new place! I told Leah the situation and she was more than happy to try blonde dye! Well, what do you know, I loved it! My hair is getting healthier and it isn't breaking like it used to! Thanks Leah, you are awesome!\n",
      "This seems like a nice place although the girl told my hair was damaged and in bad shape and honestly I ALREADY KNOW THAT. I mean since ITS ON MY HEAD EVERYDAY, Im aware of what it looks like and everyone says I have beautiful hair so I just cant always afford 200 to 300 color and cuts all the time and have to do what I can...plus she was talking so loud and kept talking about it for awhile so it was really embarassing since the place was full and it kind of killed the happy vibe I got about trying a new place... but it does seem like a pretty nice place so i will go back. I always give everybody a few chances, plus they serve wine there! And I love Aveda so much..\n",
      "I just got a tremendous cut from Alan Cawthorn at Tru. I was thrilled by the time, thought and effort that he put into making sure that I got exactly the look that I was hoping to get. To be honest, I think that it was the best haircut that I have had in several years.\n",
      "I enjoyed a great wash and style service today. scheduling was easy, service was great, and the stylist Seth was so personable and nice. I'll definitely be back!\n",
      "I was blessed with great hair. We all get something. Some women have perfect skin (bitches) and some women can eat all they want and never gain a pound (don't even get me started). Me, I wasn't blessed with either but damn it, I have good hair. I didn't always know this however. I rocked a legit mullet from age 8 to 14. That might actually be a conservative estimate. I have blocked out most of those memories. Somewhere around 1988, I discovered that the spiral perm living in my long blonde hair might actually look better if I stopped cutting the top of my hair into a boy cut, with feathers. Don't get me wrong, feathered hair is amazing. My mullet, was not. So, cut to the late 90s (there were a few years of \"transition\") and I have officially embraced my naturally blonde, thick, and long hair and one might even say that I am able to style it like an actual chick. So, In an effort to actually do something with my blessed tresses, I tend to try a new stylist quite often and when I go to a new stylist, I expect him or her to jump up and down and stomp their feet when they see me. I have the holy grail of hair! Let's get inspired!! Yay! Right? Wrong. Instead, it is the same old uninspired cut and blow out that the chick sitting in the chair prior to me received. No one ever seems to want to do something fabulous. Then one day, I found Kim Tvedten (at her previous studio). We hit it off right away. Ok, so she didn't jump up and down or stomp her feet. I realize now that perhaps I have too high of expectations, But, what she did do amazed me. She asked a ton of questions and she listened to every response. She truly wanted to understand how I \"see\" my hair and how I want to see it. I absolutely loved my first cut and color. So much so, I went back a couple months later to get tuned up for my 20th high school reunion. That is a pretty big compliment. Ya know a girl needs to look good for the 20, or at least as good as their photoshopped Facebook pics! When Kim moved to Salon Tru, I moved right along with her. I also added a friend and my husband to her clientele. My hubby had the same stylist for years and I never thought he would leave. I honestly never thought he would care enough to leave. He's a dude. But, he simply says that Kim gives him the best cuts he has ever had...and I couldn't agree more!! Almost a year later and I am keeping up with regular visits better than I ever have in my life. Her cuts make my hair look better than it has in years. Because my hair is thick, I need a true artist to add layers with the shears and dimension with the color. Kim is a rock star at this! I honestly love my hair every single day. Even the days that I don't wash it. It just looks GOOD. And it is not because I was blessed with \"good hair\". I tend to hate my hair as much as any woman. We seem to just be cursed with hair dissatisfaction. OR so I thought! Perhaps we are all just waiting for that professional stylist who loves getting the absolute BEST from whatever it is we are blessed with. Go see Kim T. at Salon Tru. You will NOT be disappointed. OH and she gives a wonderful hand and arm massage while you are sipping on your wine!\n",
      "The location is great and the stylists are mostly nice, but I've had a few issues. I have been there 4 times and each time I have seen tiny cockroaches, or some kind of bug that looks like that, crawling out from under the drying bench. Not sure what or how many creatures are living under there. As an Aveda salon they are a bit overpriced, but it seemed worth it. I have dark hair by had a strip bleached for a while. On my last appointment I had to have a different stylist since my normal one was out sick and I couldn't reschedule. The new girl out product on my roots and I sat under the roach dryers. She rinsed it out and I thought it seemed a bit orangey in comparison to the icy blonde look I requested and normally got. I brushed it off as the lighting and went home. During the next few days I realized it wasn't the lighting and the roots weren't fully lifted. I called to explain, not complain, and they said I could come in and have the same stylist redo the area free of charge for the inconvenience. That seemed like a great offer so I returned a few days later. The stylist redid my hair, making subtle excuses and acting dumbfounded for why the area was orange instead of blonde. When I was finished she asked what they said on the phone about charges and I said they promised it would be free. She argued back saying her services would be free, but that I would have to pay for the product she used. I was already a bit mad since I was told it would be free, but more irked because I shouldn't have to pay for the product that is fixing their mistake. If they would have applied it correctly the first time I wouldn't have had to come back. I ended up paying more than half of my original appointment cost, which was disappointing.\n",
      "Helen is the best!!! She always knows what I want. She is quick and efficient and professional. Looking for a sexy updo? Helen is amazing. Thanks Helen\n",
      "Ok so my wife has been going here for almost 2 years and her hair color looks great. Her hair stylist is Joel. She says he is a color specialist and judging by her hair color she is right. Great job Joel the colors that my wife has tried throughout her two years with you adds to her sexuality. This definitely spices things up!\n",
      "I love Emily! After she rescued me from a total color disaster about a year ago, I have refused to see anyone else. Not only is she skilled and experienced, she always takes the time to really understand what I'm looking for and explains options and techniques in a way that is easy to understand. I always feel like we're on the same page before she does anything to my hair and I trust her completely! My haircut yesterday was EXACTLY what I was hoping for- even more so than I even understood going in. Thank you Emily!\n",
      "Misty Doble is fabulous. Thank you for always helping me to look my best. Always a great haircut and the scalp and should massage are always welcome! You're one of the best in the business for sure.\n",
      "I recently started coming to Salon Tru when my stylist Kristi moved to this salon. The salon is very nice and clean but the real reason I love it is Kristi. She always does an amazing job on my color and cuts and I always get compliments on how great my color is. Kristi has a true talent and she can create any look you want. I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know because I know they wont be disappointed!\n",
      "I've been going to Salon Tru for over 4 years now and have nothing but great things to say about it. Misty does a phenomenal job, and she is my primary reason for going to Salon Tru. I've recommended Misty to several of my friends who have all be very satisfied. If you want a consistent cut from a stylist who listens and provides great ideas, go see Misty.\n",
      "I've been searching for a great haircutter since I moved to Scottsdale from NY. I stopped in Salon Tru to pick up some Aveda products and get my bangs trimmed. I was lucky enough to meet Sarah, who not only cut my bangs perfectly, but mentioned that she likes to cut hair while it's dry. That was a miracle for me because what better way to see how your final cut will look then as someone is cutting it! Sarah is lovely, talented and did an amazing job. I have long straight hair that needs lots of texturing and she knew exactly what to do. I highly recommend Sarah at Salon Tru and you'll also love the captivating Aveda scent as you open the door and the free samples of the unique hair products that they stock. Thank you Sarah, I'll be back!\n",
      "Arnold Terry has now been at Salon Tru for a year and a half. He's one of the best hair stylists in town and so glad he made the move to this salon. It's an Aveda concept salon; Michael the owner is terrific, and their team is great. Rachel and Wendy are some of the best customer service/front desk women I've met at a salon. Fun, professional and talented without the pretense. If you're looking for a great salon, this is it.\n",
      "I want to recommend Kristi at Salon Tru for color, highlight and cut. While visiting my daughter in the area, I was fortunate enough to get an appointment with this very talented stylist. Kristi spent time with me, fielding out my needs and helping me decide where I wanted to take my hair in the next year. I will be attending my daughter's wedding and frankly needed a lot of advice. I'm thrilled with the results. Thanks Kristi. You're a miracle worker!\n",
      "I have been in the market for a new hair stylist for a while and with a head full of unruly, curly/thick hair I decided to give them a try. My stylist was Tina and my experience was amazing. I was looking for highlights and she took them to the next level, adding 2 colors instead of 1 to give the overall look more depth. I also explained to her that I don't like to put too much work into my look and I hate blow drying my hair and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She suggested a couple of products to me toward the end which were amazing. I am very impressed and I am happy to report that I have found my new stylist.\n",
      "It started out great....super cut and color, nice stylist, comfortable shop....pricey but nothing crazy...then back for another visit - good color, ok cut....then another visit - ok color, bad cut...ugh. Why do stylists lose their groove? that is seriously irritating. I couldnt take it, no going back for me. I could have gone back and had her fix it, etc but at that pt - I was just DONE - as in, get me to a new stylist. There may be some other stylists at the shop that are better, but I am not risking it!\n",
      "My husband's hair is tough to cut. This salon was his third salon after we move to Phoenix. Jena does an excellent job. We try not to share the same stylist b/c he says I am a salon slut. But, I must say I think I can be very loyal to Salon Tru b/c Jena is great and the salon is very professional. She now offers the Brazillian Blow-Out as well. The prices are reasonable and the talent is TRU.... The salon was also very generous with a donation to a non-profit where I volunteer. They give back to the community!\n",
      "Salon Tru is a high quality salon with friendly professional stylists and staff. I always feel welcome and well taken care of during my visits. Joel Molenaar is amazing! Joel has been my hair stylist since I moved to Arizona 19 years ago. Over all of those years Joel has always made my hair look fabulous. Even as my hair has changed and matured over the years Joel has managed to keep it looking healthy with beautiful color and cuts that I am lucky enough to receive compliments on all of the time. I always feel like a million bucks after each appointment!\n",
      "Emi Williams is now at Tru Salon! This is great news as she is my hair guru! Her knowledge and skill as a colorist and stylist make my professional and personal life easy...I feel confident and really enjoy the compliments. I also love spending time with Emi as a person when having my hair done, she is kind and funny and the whole experience is something I always look forward to. I cannot recommend her enough and love going to see her at Tru. Thanks for all you do Emi, you truly are a Master.\n",
      "I have been seeing Arnold at Tru Salon for more than 5 years. I've never been disappointed and he is always willing to try new things on me. Everyone at the salon is super nice and helpful. And I love the Aveda products too! I strongly recommend that you make an appointment with Arnold for your hair!\n",
      "I love Salon Tru, friendly staff and excellent service. Emily has been doing my hair for years and she does a fantastic job! I change the style or color of my hair almost every time I go in for an appointment and Emily has no problem with keeping up with my crazy requests! She is great! Thank you so much!\n",
      "Love Kim - She cut my long hair for donation and gave me a great cut!!!\n",
      "I had been going to the same stylist for almost ten years back home before I found myself in Phoenix and desperately needing my hair done. A friend had just gone to Salon Tru, so I made an appointment. I didn't want to change my color too much and since I'm growing my hair out, only needed a trim. Julie listened to my needs and was able to offer her own suggestions as well. I was so pleased with the results, I'd definitely go back if I were still in the area. My only complaint was I had to wait 30min after my appointment time!\n",
      "I really enjoy going to Salon Tru. I followed my stylist GiGi Arredondo when she joined their team a few months ago. I really like the location. It sits on the corner and there are lots of choices for a post haircut lunch.. The salon is clean and they sell Aveda porducts. The self serve drinks are near the front door and the environment is relaxing. I'm looking forward to going back. I highly recommend Gigi and Salon Tru.\n",
      "I'm not a huge Aveda fan but I recently had my hair cut by Jenna at Salon Tru and have to be honest: it was the best haircut I've had in a very long while. Jenna was a dream--went above and beyond to listen to what I wanted and was honest about the results I'd get if she'd followed through with my requests (how often does that happen?). She gave me a great cut--I have pretty long, coarse hair and she was precise enough to ensure that I could keep my length while still feeling like I actually have a style. I was also at a weird point in growing out in my bangs and Jenna cleaned them up without taking me back to square one. The salon wasn't pretentious despite the Old Town location--the atmosphere was laid back but very nice. I didn't have any issue at all with scheduling or parking and, while efficient, the front desk staff were friendly and polite enough despite some other reviewers' experiences. I will definitely go back to Salon Tru and Jenna.\n",
      "I am going to start with how horrible my experience was the first time I went to this salon. The man who dyed my hair literally turned it blue. I am not kidding....my scalp and hair ended up blue. He was rushed by his owner or manager and I was forced to pay before my stylist finished/before I was even able to see if I liked my hair. for $175, that is obviously insane.... I called back and let them know that my scalp and hair was in fact blue, and they reluctantly gave me an appointment with someone else. I will not say his name on here because he is a good stylist/colorist.....but after going to him 3 times and paying $200 each time for a root touch up and toning/ and having it done half ass was unbelievable. $200?!?!?!?!? It would be one thing if he actually toned my hair properly....but to no surprise the 3rd time he did my hair it turned bright yellow as soon as I got home. He had the nerve to tell me he would charge me \"half price\" to fix it. HOW LAUGHABLE. When you mess up someone's hair, who tips you over 20% overtime, YOU FIX IT. This happened about 3 months ago, I am just now getting to writing the review. You couldn't pay me to come back here and trust such idiots with my hair.\n",
      "I purchased a Groupon to Salon Tru and for the first time ever, almost missed the chance to use it before it expired. I called early this morning to get a manicure, but they were booked solid. I've been wanting to get a streak of bright color in my hair ever since I colored over it last year so I asked if that was possible and what the cost would be. I remember being told was that it would be $90, so I asked the cost without the blow dry, and I was told $45. Perfect, the Groupon was for $50. The woman on the phone was SO nice and cheery and so I expected equal service in the salon. I got in about 4 minutes late, and was kind of ignored until I moved to stand directly in front of the receptionist's line of vision. Both she and another woman who came out a few minutes later were not very welcoming. It was 2:10 or so by now and Colleen came to pick me up and we went to her chair. I described what I wanted. She seemed to be having one of those days.. or maybe that's just her personality. She went back to check on hair dye colors and returned after what felt like 5 minutes. I decided on purple, so she went to the back again to mix the bleach. 5 minutes later, just as she was about to apply the bleach to literally a 1\" section of hair, I asked how much it would be, because I had a feeling something was weird. She told me \"umm, probably $75.\" I told her that's not what I was quoted, and that's not what I was willing to pay. I'd blow dry my own hair if I had to, but $75 for a tiny piece of hair was ridiculous. She told me the person on the phone was wrong and her prices \"start at $45\" but was based on sitting time. (So apparently if you have darker hair, you get screwed and have to pay more than people with lighter hair because it takes longer?) She again disappeared to the back to \"ask someone\" what could be done, and came back saying she could put in fake purple extensions for the Groupon price. Fine, sure, not at all what I wanted, but okay. I asked what colors, decided on purple again, and when she came back, I didn't like the color of the extensions, they were a faded purple. She went back again to bring out the other colors, one of which was a richer purple (why wouldn't she just grab them all in the first place?) I ended up doing 4 pieces for $50. I am really put out with the customer service experience and will not go back, unfortunately. If you want an experience ten times better, try going to Dolce.\n",
      "I have been going to Salon Tru for about 4 years now and have loved every experience I have had. Emily is my go to gal and is VERY good at what she does. She took my box dyed almost black hair back to blonde slowly and safely!! I am a natural blonde and have kept it that way since. Every appointment I let her pick my highlight colors and she always does an amazing job! She does what is best for the health of your hair while keeping your wants in mind :) The rest of the staff is also helpful and prompt!! Did I mention they offer you wine??\n",
      "I love Salon Tru! Helen is the BEST! And Aveda color is my fave! I am not a big fan of the products bc my hair dont like em but my hair loves the color. Strange but tru! If you are looking for a great stylist, ask for HELEN! Thanks for all you do Helen!\n",
      "Have had two perfect experiences at Trú with my new stylist Regina. I have already referred others to Regina and, my friends who went to Regina also had great cut and color experiences.\n",
      "This was my 1st visit. The receptionist said I would love Amanda. She was wrong. I brought in photos from a foreign magazine which costs me 3 times to get as an American magazine. I explained to Amanda that I wanted her to work with my natural waves. i also said, \"I do not want you to dry my hair straight first and then make it wavy.\" She used this sock thing on her dryer. She dried my hair straight. She asked me what I thought of it. I told her I did not like the way she dried my hair. I said this is not what I asked for. That it was straight and not wavy and I said to her I think you should redo it. She started giving me all sorts of suggestions about how to dry it wavy which is not what I asked for. Then she took a curling iron and put a bunch of ringlets in it which a.) are not my style. I wanted sexy and modern not romantic English countryside, b.) I told to not dry my hair striaght 1st and then make it wavy & c.) I never said I wanted curly. When I went out that evening I was embarassed by my hair instead of happy with it and angry with Amanda for doiing exactly what I very specifically asked her not to do and also for not giving me what I paid for. I am not sure about the haircut yet as I have not washed my hair. Also the tiny bit of volumizing product she put in left my hair completely flat at the roots which matched none of my pics. What can I say. Should I have said I am not leaving until rewash and redo my hair? I am still in need of a good styllst after being in Phoenix over a year. Haircut plus tip cost me $60 but I was so angry when I left that I would really like my money back. I called in and complained Saturday night. She is supposed to call me back.I explained how poor her customer service was in not giving me what I wanted and trying to get me out the door with suggestions and doing the horrible curling iron thing with the extra hot salon curling iron. The curls are finally loosening up a day later.\n",
      "Salon Tru is very nice salon, but a little pricey. I think you get what you pay for though. I get my hair cut by Jessica and I love her!!!! I give her free reign on my hair and just let her do whatever she wants. She just knows that my hair style can't be too \"out there\" or make me look like a 35 year old who is trying wayyyyyyy to hard. If you are a guy looking for a good style and aren't afraid to go to an actuall salon, check out Salon Tru and ask for Jessica. You won't be disappointed\n",
      "I absolutely love Salon Tru! Ask for Misty!! It is a far drive for me (I live close to Anthem) but it is totally worth it! Misty is the best! I can explain what I want, feeling like I don't make sense half the time and she GETS it! She knows exactly what I like, color-wise and cut-wise, knows exactly what my hair can do and is always up-to-date on the cuts, styles and color. I highly recommend Misty! Of course, I wish it was less expensive but it is my hair and is what is seen every day by everybody and to me, there is no price I wouldn't pay! Totally worth it!\n",
      "I am a hairstylist from an Aveda salon that just moved to the Phoenix area from out of state. I was very nervous to get my hair done by somebody new, and being a stylist myself I am very picky. I made an appointment with Amanda per the recommendation of one of the few people I know in the area, and she was amazing! She did exactly what I asked for, she was friendly, timely, and the price was fair. Thank you Amanda, I will be back!\n",
      "The staff and owner truly enjoy doing what they do and want to make it a positive experience for the patron.\n",
      "I just recently.started going to Allison at Salon Tru. I was fairly new in town and had been referred to a not so great stylist in the old town area. After four disappointing spots I decided to move on. Thx to all the great reviews I gave this aveda salon a try and am so glad I did!! Im finally getting what I expect leaving a nice salon. Great staff, products, and location. I would recommend Allison to anyone!!\n",
      "I love Salon Tru! I have gone to Aveda Concept Salons before, but this was my first time at Salon Tru. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and was offered a beverage. I waited only about 3 minutes and my stylist came to greet me. My stylist was Tina, and she is AMAZING!! I went in wanting a cut and color, and I had pictures of the color I wanted. She gave me her honest opinion, and told me what would look good on me and what wouldn't. I came out with an AMAZING cut and color! I couldn't be more in love with how the color turned out. I will definitely return, and will request Tina. She is amazing, and has been doing hair for a LONG time. She definitely knows what she is doing!! I 100% recommend Salon Tru and Tina!\n",
      "This salon is the best. I just wish I would have found it sooner!! Salon Tru goes above and beyond expectations. All the staff there are very friendly and knowledgeable. My color stylist, Seth, was absolutely amazing. He took so much time to accommodate my needs and give me helpful input. Also my hair stylist, Ivy, was awesome. She made my hair look fabulous with some wavy beach curls:) I also had a facial done at this salon a week prior to my hair appointment. Vivienne, the esthetician, was phenomenal. It was the best facial I had ever received. Please check this place out!\n",
      "This is my favorite hair salon that I've ever been to! Lisa has been my stylist for the past 2 years and she is irreplaceable! She always knows exactly what I want and which colors to go for with my super dark hair. If you want a natural look and a flawless color then Lisa is your gal!\n",
      "I followed my stylist, Misty, to Salon True when she moved there a few years back. I came because Misty is amazing, and I would follow her anywhere, but I've been very happy with the service at the salon as well. The staff is friendly, and pretty prompt. The location is great - after your day of pampering you can go shop or eat a great lunch or have a cocktail! It is also easy to get to from many parts of the Valley. I live in Central Phoenix, and work in Tempe, and it is a short drive from either place. If you're looking for a great stylist at Salon Tru, I highly recommend Misty. She has been doing my hair for 6 years, and I wouldn't see anyone else. She is professional, really talented, very creative, hip, and honest about my hair and what looks best on me. I know I can trust her to do something that will make me look fantastic and feel fresh/new every time I come in. Misty takes real pride in her work, and cares deeply about her clients, so she will never let you leave the salon unhappy (even if it was your crazy idea to cut super short bangs or dye your hair purple). Finally, you get a head and neck massages with all haircuts. That alone is reason enough to go!\n",
      "I will only go to Lisa Kinney for my cut and color. I followed her from Ide Mania. I love the convenience of location, the comfort of the salon as well. it isnt flashy and overwhelming, like a lot of salons. Its just right for me . Dont get me wrong- its classy. Also, they have started offering \"bootcamps\" for things like blowdry and updos- something I really need! Alicia is great and friendly for waxing too! You might want to know that you have to pay each stylist/waxer, etc separately which is a little strange. Also they seem confused when you pay with cash. No worries- they are friendly though! Great selection on Aveda products.\n",
      "I'm a big fan of Jessica at Salon Tru- she always gives me a cut that relaxes my naturally thick, coarse hair. I get my hair colored here, as well, and always get compliments on the shine and color depth.\n",
      "Another great hair cut from Maren! Finally she cut my hair real short!!! Not sure what else to say as I just don't have such an intimate relation to my hair stylist unlike some other reviewers ... :-) Facts are: hair cut is great, place is conveniently located with ample parking, hardly any wait times and $ 35 for a guy's hair cut is great.\n",
      "Being the daughter of a hairstylist, I am extremely picky about who I trust with my hair. I moved cross country away from my home salon and saw Misty by reccomendation. She is incredible at color and my cut was flawless every time. She listened to everything I wanted and it turned out better than it ever has before! I'm blonde and it's been hard to find someone to get the color just right. Misty is so sweet and wonderful at what she does. A true professional that also became a friend :) Go see her and you will agree!!! She's the best!\n",
      "I had a hair color disaster in December at a different salon that permanently altered the color and health of my 3 feet-long, blond hair. This was with a highly rated, very certified Aveda Educator and so-called color specialist (Angie Perino Nelson), so I was having trust issues about my hair. That's why I sought several consultations in December and January in the Phoenix Valley. Of all of consultations I had, the BEST one was with Keith N. at Salon Tru-Scottsdale. He gave me the most detailed, conservative advice. I really appreciate that and believe that says something about a person and his artistry. He gave me some straight talk about the condition and color of my hair. He assessed my hair and advised me to that I will need a good trim and a root-to-tip, color deposits-only color correction alternating/adding 2 each darker shades of blond. He said my hair looks really fake, unnatural, & too yellow, and that the crown was too light for my coloring. (My thoughts exactly). He suggested I wait at least 6 weeks in order to get some roots so he can reformulate. Then I'll have to go a bit darker to look natural again. I have since decided to wait about a year before moving forward with a root-to-tip correction. I'd like to see how much of this Light Yellow Orange (Aveda's LYO) combo 10-N semi-permanent toner washes out and how light--or white--my hair will get before I do a final, root-to-tip correction. I will update this review in the future once I get my final, permanent color correction.\n",
      "This is hands down the best salon I've ever been to! I found Salon Tru on Yelp last summer when I first moved to Scottsdale. I was looking for a quality salon that I could become a loyal client of and was impressed by their reputation. This is without a doubt a 5 star salon. My hair grows quick so I get it done every 4-6 weeks, meaning I spend a lot of time in the salon. The atmosphere and outstanding customer service makes the time I spend enjoyable, and I've never actually looked forward to hair appointments until I found Salon Tru. I would describe the ambience as relaxed, friendly, and professional. I'm offered any type of beverage the moment I walk through the door, including coffee, tea and wine. Also worth mentioning is the quality of the reception at Salon Tru. It's the little things that add up to an overall superlative experience and I really appreciate the phone calls to confirm and remind me of my appointments 24 hours ahead of time. I hate having to reschedule appointments as I feel it's discourteous to stylists, but the few times I have the reception at Salon Tru has been more than accommodating. They are consistently friendly and it makes a huge difference! Above all, this review is of my hair stylist, Allison. Do yourself a favor and specifically request to schedule an appointment with her, you will NOT regret it! She's been doing hair for well over a decade (I believe just celebrated 15 years) and it's evident in the quality of her work. Because of her tenure, she is able to style hair in the way you want, while prioritizing the preservation of its health. Of course she is extremely sweet and personable, and as if she weren't amazing enough, she gives hand massages! I'm so grateful to have found her and you couldn't pay me to go to any other stylist in Scottsdale.\n",
      "I followed a stylist to Salon Tru a couple of years ago. It's clean and easy to park and they remind me with a follow up phone call. The salon is fine but Colleen, the stylist is amazing. Not only does she truly listen and work with me to achieve the outcomes that I want but she's bent over backwards to accommodate my wacky schedule. Love it.\n",
      "Salon Tru is one of the best salons I have been too in a long time! I have had four different services here and each one has been better than the last. Leah is amazing and an expert colorist. My blonde highlights look awesome and I could not be happier. She is also a joy to be around and so much fun to chat with. Alicia is literally one of the best estheticians in the Valley. I have had two airbrush tans, a Brazilian wax and an eye brow wax. All turned out perfect. I have had other airbrush tans before, and Alicia is hands down the best. Best of all, Salon Tru has incredibly friendly staff and their prices are beyond reasonable. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place!\n",
      "I love Salon Tru. And I LOVE my stylist, Topher. I am insanely vain about very few things... but I would do anything for my hair. Topher has helped me come out of my platinum-turned-brunette phase into a very beautiful ginger color! We are soon going strawberry blonde, a la Emma Stone, and I am so jazzed. He. Is. Amazing. The salon is super easy to get to for being in Scottsdale; it's right on the outer edge of Old Town so it's super simple to get there even when there are events and stuff going on. The salon is bright and fun and smells like all the fantastic Aveda and Davines products! Have I died and gone to hair heaven?! ...Oh no I have not! I've just been going to Salon Tru to see Topher to let him make me feel like a gorgeous-haired ginger snap!\n",
      "I have nothing but great things to say about the staff at salon tru! This location in Scottsdale is incredibly convenient for me in the heart of old town. I heard about the salon through word of mouth and will not be changing salons after this! I hadn't realized until I arrived the first time that they are an Aveda salon. Which is a plus for me! Allison was the first stylist I worked with and she did a great job. Incredibly thorough and thoughtful about the process. Allison is focused when it comes to hair and I appreciated her style. Robin handled my eyebrow waxing and did a phenomenal job. My second experience with salon tru I worked with Emily as my previous stylist wasn't available. Emily took the exact photograph I gave her and made it happen for me. Her upbeat nature and positive vibes were awesome! I couldn't have been happier with how my hair turned out! The experiences overall with both stylists were truly amazing and I highly recommend salon tru.\n",
      "Not really much to say about this place. If you're looking for a VERY LOW KEY kind of evening, come here. Trust me, all you need is $20. I came here one night with a few \"high roller\" friends who frequent the Emerald Island Casino. I took out $20, won an extra $40 playing the $0.01 slots, took about 7 jagger shots while gambling and even won a free meal at their cafe. Talk about a cheap date! The only VERY BIG drawback to this place is the constant fog, aka, the smoke from cigarettes. I had to drink a lot so I would stop my headache from the smoke. Other than that, super fun night!\n",
      "Restaurant was pretty good, but it SO wasn't worth what I went through to get it. Went in with a friend on a Sunday and asked for a table which took about 40 mins. \"Okay, no biggie\" I thought. Understandable, it's lunch rush on the weekend so it's to be expected. We decided to kill time by just walking around and seeing the wall decorations and various machines on display when I was approached by one of the workers asking if I was 21 (I was not). She tells me I'm not allowed to be by the machines because of that reason and I don't protest. Rules are rules, that's fair. So my friend and I go back to the counter where ypu ask for a table to wait out the rest of the time and she comes up to us again and basically tells us we shouldn't even be touching the ground and backs us AGAINST THE WALL in this cramped, barely 10 square foot, poor excuse of a waiting area. Lady, WE WERE WAITING FOR OUR TABLE. I was standing there for the remainder of our wait and she harasses me probably twice more before we are finally seated. The restaurant workers were great and I had a pleasant dining experience except for the near constant harassment of this woman. Why I have to have been alive for 21+ years just to stand on your dirty carpeting is so important, I may never know. What I do know is that they'll never get the business of me or my acquaintances again. Seniors and adults, enjoy the casino as you've been doing. Young adults, just go across the street to the Rainbow. They're much friendlier and have a proper waiting area for you to sit at.\n",
      "The Emerald Island is by far the best casino in Henderson and I have been to all of them at one time or another. I feel the difference is the staff at the Emerald Island which consists of not only great employees but genuine good people. I usually go early in the morning to beat the heat, so the people I usually deal with are on the graveyard shift. Starting with manager Rick,the nicest guy that you will ever meet and he never fails to greet us with a smile making sure everything is satisfactory. Rick does a little of everything from managing his staff to picking up trash. An amazing guy. His assistant Mike is an exceptional young man with a heart of gold. When Mike is in charge on Rick's days off, he is always helpful and handles things like a pro. Like Rick, Mike does everything from performing his managing duties to wiping off slot machines. From the bar is two of my favorite people at the Emerald Island are Linda and Sara. Both are very professional in their duties and are a blast to talk to. Linda and Sara give you a comfortable welcome feeling during your visit to the Emerald Island. Two other points I think are important are the cleanliness and security. First of all the Emerald Island is spotless.Everybody cleans constantly. The second point is the lack of riff-raff in the casino. Security does an excellent job in moving these people along with stern professional presence and patience.Richard and Philip are both great guys always offering to help you out with anything you need. This is this first time I have ever written a review on any website but i thought Emerald Island deserved some kudos.\n",
      "They really mean when they say it's the Jewel of Henderson. I absolutely love love this place!!!! Everyone is Cheery and friendly Linda is definitely the best Bartender in town. She is amazing!! I couldn't forget about Daryl always makes me laugh love the atmosphere everything about it. If you are near Henderson you must check out The Emerald! Oh you can't forget to grab some food everything on their menu is delicious.\n",
      "$9 baseball cut steak dinner with a nice big craft beer included. Try and eat in the bar if it's karaoke night as there are some regulars that will give you some good entertainment. You might see an Elvis or two if you're lucky. Foods great for the price. Service has been hit or miss the few times I've been there.\n",
      "This casino is an emerald island in a sea flooded with monolithic impersonal properties. Emerald Island may not be a palace for millionaires but there is room for fun. It is a room with only one bar and a cafe where the hits of the 1970s are the soundtrack. With its old school interior and 1970s soundtrack with a location off nostalgic Water Street, Emerald Island is That 1970s Casino. Today is the longest span of time that I spent here. The rain in nearby Boulder City put a damper on outdoor activities. Instead of driving Boulder Highway to Fremont Street, I'd visit downtown Henderson. Emerald Island is one of the trilogy of downtown Henderson casinos off of Water Street. Emerald Island is also the Cheers of casinos. There is a hometown vibe to the place where many of the people knows your name. That says something considering that the one bar has been full to capacity.Generally speaking the customers and staff are down to earth and friendly. I guess the happy tunes of the 1970s is contagious. Today the bar tender was joking around by improvising a couple of these oldies. On a previous visit, the bar tender was a friendly personable lady. This was a few months ago when the Coffee House was in business. I was walking back from the Coffee House with a Beatles biography in my hand. When I stopped in the bar, the friendly bartender engaged me in a conversation about rock & roll biographies. Owing to the fact that this is a bar that excludes the standard American beers on draft, my drink of choice here has been the $3 Alaskan Ale draft. With good conversation and a greatest hits of the 1970s soundtrack, this is my kind of bar. Today, I played at the bar, and casino at the newest Keno machine, and Caveman Keno. There are a few quarter Keno machines.This is expected since Emerald Island promotes itself as Nevada's Only All Penny Casino. Playing nickel Keno was all good. A $5 bill kept me in action close to 3 hours. In that time, the Cocktail Server was persistent with drinks. I'd order a Spicy Bloody Mary. I could tell when a Spicy Bloody Mary is quality when I am not drinking the equivalent of Pacific Ocean water (salt) and it includes olives. At the same time that Emerald Island has a 1970s vibe, it is up with the times in non-table casino games. The casino has a few of the newest Keno games. Keno is merging with video game graphics to produce new games such as Circus Keno, Balloon Keno, and Red Neck Keno.The price of this technology is tight machines that quickly brought me back to Caveman Keno. Today was the first time dining in their 24 hour cafe. It is a small room with a no-frills interior. The upshot is that a common noise in the casino is \"____party of __your table is ready.\" The hostess seated my party of 1 right away. The highlight of the cafe is the open kitchen where cooking is on display. I ordered Chicken Parmesan that included a cup of vegetable beef soup or salad. The entree was a full plate with 2 slabs of Chicken Parmesan alongside pasta with a separate plate of garlic bread. It was 3 stars. Likewise for the after dinner coffee. I give a shout out to my Waitress Rosie. She is a people person that was extraordinary friendly. She was persistent on checking up on me. She had a sense of humor. She'd be an outstanding Yelper. Rosie even placed the leftovers in the doggy bag for me. Rosie's outstanding attitude is the wildcard that raised a 3.5 star rating to 4.\n",
      "Wow, an above average dinner! My mom and Aunt love the downtown Henderson casinos so we all went here one night for dinner. My Aunt and I both started with a cup of cream corn soup, and from the first taste of soup we knew this was going to be an excellent dining experience. My Aunt got the T-Bone which was very tender and cooked to perfection. My Mom had the coconut shrimp special that she noted as fresh and light. I had the Country Fired Steak and French fries. The French fries were awesome! Some of the best fries I have ever had. The service was also top notch. Constantly refilling drinks and asking if we needed anything. The price is also very reasonable. I used to come here for a steak and eggs breakfast when I lived in Henderson and remembered always having a good experience.\n",
      "I love this small local casino. Great variety of machines and they have the best food around. The players club is one of the best for a local casino. You could eat there almost every night with your points for free. All the employees are very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "I've been a patron of Emerald Island since 2009 this place is the Jewel of Henderson great food I get a meal free weekly thru promotional perks,loose machines plus friendly staff keeps me coming here every week.\n",
      "Bar makes really good white russians, loose slots, friendly staff, great atmosphere. Love the players rewards. Plus I like that it is within walking distance to two other casinos.\n",
      "Hidden jewel of Henderson indeed!! A true locals casino. Small but \"charming\" in its own unique way! Good place to kill time if business ever takes you to the old part of downtown Henderson. Friendly staff ( who remember your name) loose slots and cheap good eats!! The food at the cafe is surprisingly good and satisfying!! Been here twice, and will go back if another errand takes me to that side of town!!! Video poker bar makes good Bloody Marys served with very plump green olives & a fresh crunchy celery stalk!!\n",
      "Ah, the Jewel of Henderson. I was so impressed at how friendly and helpful the staff were the first time I went to Emerald Island that I keep going back. A friend of mine once told me he hated the place because their slots are \"tighter than a 13-year old virgin.\" Actually, these days that might not be so tight. Seriously, I've gone there and won, I\"ve gone and lost. Nobody should really ever expect to win anyway when they gamble. The one area this establishment shines above the rest is their service. I've never had to wait for a cocktail and all the girls are very friendly. I don't know all their names, but Gwen comes to mind. They have a small restaurant and I've enjoyed all my meals there. Again, the service in the restaurant has been fastastic. If had had one complaint, it would be that the place is always so darned busy. My girlfriend and I have gone in there on different nights of the week and just once we'd like to sit at the bar and play - but there are never any open stools. I guess that's a good thing. I may not win much at Emerald Island, but as long as the service remains top-notch, I'll keep going back.\n",
      "Breakfast sucks! Corned beef hash-sucks Over easy eggs-sucks Scrambled eggs- wait for it.........sucks Toast-sucks....how do you screw up toast???? Had to go to the kitchen for our own coffee refills No drink refillls even offered on other drinks. Did I mention there were only 2 other occupied tables? Go somewhere else.....go anywhere else.....slowly figuring out why the Rainbow always has a wait time\n",
      "The restaurant is seriously a hidden GEM. How did I not know about this place?! SOOO good and clean!! I love when places actually CLEAN things! we had the steak and lobster special and holy wow! It came with soup/salad, a potato side, some veggies, the steak and lobster, AAAAND boston cream pie! That is SO much food! And for such a small price! The staff is just freakin PERFECT! Everyone was SO nice and friendly and VERY prompt. They're pretty busy and usually are but there is a darn good reason why!\n",
      "I am one of those AARP card holders who frequents Emerald Isle only because: (1) walking distance from my apartment, (2) Monday thru Friday at 6 pm they serve free food and (3) my points equal free meals. Can't go wrong with steak & lobster on Friday using my points. If you get a players card, you are sent coupons for a free meal once a week (choice of breakfast or lunch/dinner). The servers come around often with beverages. The entire staff is courteous, friendly and helpful. Yes, it's smokey but what casino isn't. My absolute favorite place to spend my time and money. They have recently expanded their menu to offer smoked meats. They play great music and their drinks are great. Try their Irish coffee and strawberry margaritas. Every Thursday is gift giveaway. I have been there when they have served fresh cookies, warm muffins and ham & cheese subs to all players. These perks are important to the players and I don't know of any other casino in the local Henderson area that offers these perks. Give it a try and you won't regret it.\n",
      "The casinos restaurant is really good we were greeted immediately and sat within 1 minute I ordered the Reuben with onion rings and we had a quesadilla for a app. The Reuben was really good lots of sauce and sauerkraut and the meat was tender. The onion rings where a soft batter which I like the quesadilla was filled with a lot of chicken and peppers our server Becky did a great job and so did our busser Kiko. The atmosphere was really nice. They had just remodeled whoever did it did a great job they were super busy which is always a good sign. we will definitely be back.\n",
      "Another hidden gem in Old Henderson! I've only been in here twice, but both times were great. The restaurant has awesome dinner specials, but is super small. I thought that there would be more tables - it's no wonder that there is always a wait. The food is really good - Friday and Saturday the special is steak and lobster, and the last time we were there we also had crab stuffed mushrooms. The service is friendly and fast, and the customers are usually local regulars who have been dining there for YEARS. The casino itself is also really small. I don't remember actually seeing a cocktail waitress, so it may be best to get your drinks at the bar.\n",
      "This is the 2nd time this has happened in this establishment. The first time I let it slide thinking it was a fluke. We just tried to eat at the restaurant with a party of eight (5 adults 3 children) today about 9:45 pm. First the hostess asked how many, we told her 8, she said she would be back, she walked to the back then came back up front ensuring not to make eye contact with anyone. She checked someone out, then walked to the cage. Next another girl walked up asked how many, she said she would be back, she too went to the back and never to return, but stood in the back of the restaurant to discuss the situation with ALL of her fellow employees. Finally a young gentleman came up and informed us they could not seat us together and we would have to sit half in a booth and the others in a table near by, mind you there were only 2 customers in the ENTIRE restaurant. The 3 standalone tables in the middle were all empty. Very disappointed in the customer service we received. We will not be returning again.\n",
      "The food is always good, service is back & forth, sometimes amazing and sometimes downright awful but today it was great. I had a Rueben which was super full of corned beef & everything else that goes with it, except I subbed for sourdough because I hate rye.. mozzarella sticks are good, Cobb salad is ginormous..if you're in the water street district of old Henderson, definitely try this place out you won't be disappointed\n",
      "On 7/5/16 me and my wife came in the late afternoon to play some video poker at the bar Day bartender was atentive and provided good service up to this point. Me and my wife like to play we were in to the house around $600 by shift change the new bartender was a bit unatentive to say the least I was done playing there tight video poker gave my wife some more money to play my wife ordered me a shot and beer but the bar tender told us we have to pay for my drink because I'm not playing. I tried to explain to her I played $600 in the last hour and a half and she told me to bad pay for your drink. I payed in disbelieve and refused to tip. We also went to the cafe to get some ribs and chicken to go we were told no take out on ribs as quanity is low once again we explained there's no where on the board that says no take out and we wanted to get our food and go after the shalackin we took on there tight slots to no avail. We left and got Jack an the Crack. The moral of the story is go play somewhere else they look at you as a payday not a player and please give a hungry man some ribs you already got my shirt.\n",
      "I stop and eaten here every so often as I'm passing through town for years now. I look forward to eating at the restaurant here. Breakfast is delicious and so are their steaks! Servers are always quick and and friendly and I love their French fries. I'll be back soon!\n",
      "Great food and players club. My friend gets free food there on a weekly basis. We went and got free fudge sundaes and the slots were great. Nice mural work on the outside. Slightly smoky but a much better deal than the big casinos.\n",
      "My husband and I were referred her by Misty's Casino for their penny slots. We had so much fun. As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted by the smiley staff. We went up to get member club cards and were introduced to the managers of the casino. Very nice sweet ladies. It was my husband's birthday and he got a free meal from the cafe (he got the 16oz t-bone steak and loved it, only$15.95, WOW). They also anounced his name for his birthday over the intercom. What other casino does that? He played on $5 for about two hours on the penny slots. He had a blast. I enjoyed the relaxing enviroment of just sitting and playing the slots while getting free drinks and food. They pass out free pastries and sandwhichs throughout the day and night. We were there from 11:30pm til 2am. My husband won his money back, and I spent all mine, but we had a blast and very impressed by their customer service. PLEASE GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! Much better than the big casinos.\n",
      "I had their famous cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce and tomato. I went to the restroom and they cleared my table and sat a woman in my place. They reseated me and replaced my Long Island ice tea and burger. I had finished my other one and was working on the French fries. So I had a very filling lunch. The server was gracious.\n",
      "By far my favorite casino. Great gaming and drink service, easy parking and incredible food. Old vegas style service. Today was a free mexican buffet. Most times ice cream/ cookies/ pizza ect all for us players. By the way it is an all penny casino.\n",
      "Had bad experienced. We normally goes to Images right by Rainbow Casino. Went to the Emerald Grill and ordered well done burger and got mine so pink and so bloody juice lol. And the server never told me that if i ordered onion ring beside fries it will cost us more which we don't really mind. Cuz he mentioned onion rings so i ordered that instead of fries. Of course while i am waiting for my new burger because i want it well done i have to wait again and didn't even offer me anything . So when my well done burger arrive i am so full already cuz i had some of those very hard and so tough​ ribs. But its our first experience and so sad will go back to our favorite diner which is Images. Server there is more friendly\n",
      "This place was very nice and a pleasant surprice when we walked in. It was clean smelling....not all cigarette stinky. We had breakfast at the restaurant and it got an \"A\" rating, there was planty of food for a great price and the place was so clean, our waitress was so nice and attentive. We definitely will be back to eat.\n",
      "Great people, great food, a fun place to go and they know you by name. We spend a lot of time here, feels like Vegas used to be when the casinos went out of their way to make you feel welcome. This place is recommended highly by both my wife and I. Shout out to Sharon and Michelle, they both make us want to come back again and again.\n",
      "OK smallish casino with good service and decent enough machines. We thought it was just OK the 15 minutes we spent there, nothing special, not unlike Ellis Island or some Fremont Street Casinos.\n",
      "If you have not been to the Emerald Island Casino's Restaurant called the Emerald Island Grill, you are missing out. I have eaten at some of the best authentic bbq places west of the Mississippi and I can tell you that their beef brisket is hands down the best you will find anywhere. Earlier this year they added an outdoor smoker and a new bbq chef guru. On Wednesday's each week you will find ribs, smoked sausage and brisket among other bbq favorites. The brisket has a great cap, great flavor and it is super moist and tender. I cannot get enough and I wait for Wednesday to roll around every week now. You can get a fantastic brisket meal for less than $15.00.\n",
      "JEWEL OF HENDERSON Yep, that's what they call themselves. Complimentary fresh baked cookies, popcorn, and lots of on the hour gaming promotions. Reminds me of the \"good old days\" when casinos appreciated customer loyalty. It's Nevada's only all penny casino so they say. This arcade of penny slot machines with no table games has a small cafe for their customers who dare not venture into the heat. It just so happens that this month's coupon specials include sloppy joe & fries, sweet & sour chicken, burger combo, spaghetti and garlic bread Don't expect to see any evening gowns or tuxedos... it's very very blue collar.\n",
      "I bought the Casino Guide 2013 and they have a BOGO entree at their grille restaurant. We came on a Saturday evening and ordered 1. Chicken fettuccine, 14.99 2. Chicken Marsala, 14.99 for $19.20 - Easy parking. For a Saturday night, they still have plenty of parking around the back of the casino. - Rey was a really nice server. Very happy. - The entree comes with soup or salad. We both chose the soup, which was the all potato with bacon and cheese. Honestly, the bacon made the soup really salty, but it wasn't too bad. It came with a side of saltine chips! Haha. - I enjoyed the Chicken fettuccine. The noodles tasted delicious, but the chicken was a bit tough. They did provide a generous portion. Enough to probably feed 2! - The chicken marsala was also not too tender. The sauce was liquidy, basically drowned the dish. It also needed to be a bit more savory. I did like the sauteed mushrooms. I wouldn't recommend it. - Overall, they give good portions, but without a coupon for dinner, I don't think I'd come back. Casino - So many penny slots! - They had a raffle going this night, and it was a chance to win up to $10k. - They were also giving out free vanilla ice cream over chocolate and whip cream near the rewards desk. Excellent way to finish the course meal. - If you can tolerate the smoke, then you can really make your gambling urge last. - If you're under 30, then you are the outlier.\n",
      "Nothing special but not too bad. If you want really see old Vegas without going to the ghetto part of Downtown, come here. The smell of smoke still fills this old casino, always scattered with AARP card-holders who are gambling to gain those points, and the size is fairly small. But the restaurant is what I'm reviewing. Nothing special, nothing dreadful. Food is decent but not something you crave. We go there because my cousin has $15/day to spend on food (it's how they get you in to gamble). $15 will buy 2 people breakfast no problem. Service isn't bad. They're helpful and very friendly. Just looking for some basic breakfast but not a fan of Denny's or iHop (which I absolutely hate) then check out this little gem in Old Henderson. Enjoy\n",
      "This is not a good casino to win nor eat at. The food is overpriced primarily they do not get enough business. They added a William Hill Sports Betting Kiosk and that not increasing traffic at all. My main reason was for discontent was I have been coming here weekly since March on their free meal coupons it stated 11pm to 3pm. I had to cross the street and I arrived there at 3:04 pm and I have not eaten all day. Casino Manager Sharon and the owner both told me no so I was furious and gave them their card and told them to leave me alone. I truly despise a business that not only knows you but do not stand up for their customers and still expect them to be a customer. I not only can get better food prices elsewhere but have a way better gaming experience.\n",
      "Just an update on my favorite local casino. They have now added a smoker out back and they are making the best smoked meats! Tried a smoked brisket sandwich yesterday at their cafe and it was so tender and seasoned perfect. So barbeque lovers be sure to check it out. Prices are good too.\n",
      "I love this little place. The staff is very friendly! The food is good too! I had the inexpensive filet and lobster special. Yum! However, I didn't win at all on their machines. :o(\n",
      "Best food and great prices! We love eating here and sometimes have luck throwing money into the slots after dinner.\n",
      "One of the only casinos I know of that offers free food for holidays! We loved the New Years Eve spread which also included desserts! They also have free food throughout the week and a number of rotating gaming promos. Be warned, this is one of the smokiest casinos I've been in.\n",
      "Make no mistake about it, Emerald Island is a niche casino. It is not all things to all people and it doesn't try to be. It has developed a unique brand in a difficult market and owns a very loyal group of patrons. By carefully defining it's market and understanding it's demographic, it's operators have managed steady growth while maintaining superior customer service. Is Emerald Island perfect? No. Despite a few infrequent glitches and a couple of chronic issues, this casino excels in what it has set out to do...namely to provide value for the players' entertainment dollar. This is not an upscale location. There are no table games, no hotel, no nightclub and no spa. It is an unpretentious, immaculately clean and well maintained property. Both the interior and parking lot area are constantly being cleaned by dedicated employees. There are times when the casino is busy that it does get smokey. As long as Nevada allows smoking, casinos will be smokey. The smoke issue is everywhere and Emerald Island is pretty much the norm. The food is a great value and is, for the most part, really really good. Daily specials and a large menu make for a great selection of meals. Servers and cooks are not robots and certainly are not perfect. Occasionally (although in our experience rarely), a meal or service may miss the mark, but the staff's genuine desire to please completely makes up for it. Whenever we have had any issue with food, a prompt and courteous complaint to the staff has always resulted in a prompt and courteous resolution of the problem. Rude patrons or people that clean their plate before complaining aside, the staff is always responsive. As the food service here is so popular, long waits can occur. A problem that does arise is caused when families insist on brining kids to the grille at peak times. Because they can't be on the casino floor to play while they wait, kids block the entry and, being kids, they become loud and distracting. This is more of a shame on the parents, not management, but annoying none the less. What keeps us coming back is really three-fold. First, better than expected play for our gambling dollar. Their motto, \"We love you longer\", really captures the fact that you really do get reasonable play here. Gambling \"luck\" runs hot and cold. Sometimes you are the windshield... Sometimes the bug. We play here, a lot. On a consistent basis, we do better here than anywhere else we play. The second draw is their comp program. In addition to over the top generous food comps and complimentary game side snacks, the Emerald Island offers gift vouchers for local restaurants, merchants and services. While they have no spa, you can redeem points for services at at least three different places for nail care, massages and hair care. Vouchers for movies, water parks, golf and other attractions are available as are diverse services such as tax preparation, pet boarding and, on site, car washes. The reward center merchandise is expensive for both cash purchases and point redemption but when you bear in mind that they have huge point multipliers (up to 100x) it isn't completely out of line. The ultimate factor that keeps players coming back is the service. From porters and security personnel to managers and ownership, the entire staff is friendly and accessible. Key personnel are always on the floor to address issues that might arise and to be accountable for guests' needs and concerns. The rest of what Emerald Island offers, including multiple daily promotions, player loyalty gifts and monthly promotions, is really just icing on the cake.\n",
      "I loved Emerald Island Casino! This was my sure fire bet place. If I knew I wanted to win and leave with more than I walked in with, this is where I went. on days that I went to the strip or Fiesta and didnt do so well but didnt want to end the day on such a negative note, this is where I went to catch bk up. DINER: This place is tiny but not as tiny as it looks from the outside. they have a cafe/diner in the middle of the place that has specials. I only ate there once and orcered a cobb salad. gross. that's why they got one star deducted. It had iceburg lettuce, cheap croutons, just gross. Dont go there. order whats on special, thats probably better tasting. This place has tons of deal and times where they will walk around and give you a piece of cake or shrimp cocktail or random food things. They have a calendar available that shows what they are goign to give out and at what time. I really like this place. If you are in henderson, its definitelky the place to be. i liked it a 1000x better than rainbow or the eldorado. so ck it out!\n",
      "A great little spot right off of Water Street. Love the older slot machines that seem To always pay out better than anything on the strip. The little cafe is definitely a go-to spot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The smoke can get a little overwhelming sometimes, so if you have allergies or sensitivity to cigarette smoke, be warned.\n",
      "Time travel. That's what I experience here at Emerald Island casino's little cafe. It's a dinky place, set in the middle of Emerald Island casino, where you come in people know each other, and then greet you like a good neighbor once you're more than twice and they get to know you. The food is solid, portions very good and the price is very reasonable. The cafe strives to offer local favorites and such as honey dipped Fried Chicken, spaghetti with meatballs, and some sort of prime rib or t-bone steak special. As the first timer, I ordered a corned beef sandwich which comes with a choice of fries, coleslaw potato salad, macaroni salad or a cantaloupe fruit salad. The friendly waitress suggested cheesecake for dessert so I ordered it first with the extra helping of whipped cream. It arrived in a few minutes with a classic whipped cream happy face dollop upon the generous slice of cheesecake. The sandwich came a few minutes after I polished off the cheesecake, and ordered a side of horseradish and gold and spicy brown mustard to accompany the sandwich. Ill be back for the friendly service, very good quality to price ratio, and the fact this place is very nicely out of the way. The only detractor for me is that you have to walk into a casino with people who smoke cigarettes or cigars. Though the smell was not prevalent in the restaurant, just having to walk through it was the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars. Not spectacular food for a dirt bottom price, but its someplace I'm going to keep this place in my pocket to go to again and again.\n",
      "Just checking out the New Renovation at the Emerald Island Grille with my Husband, ordered Smoked corned-beef hash and eggs. Hubby ordered Calif Omlete. We will see and taste soon.\n",
      "It used to be fun coming to the Emerald Isle in spite of the smoky atmosphere because you could play all night and, even if you didn't come out ahead, at least you got to play for a while. Now, you're lucky is a $20 bill lasts 5 minutes in any of the video slots. The machines have become so tight even the free food and snacks isn't worth a visit. You might as well stay home and put your money through a shredder, at least you won't wind up smelling like an ashtray. Wake up Tim, your greed is killing off you're loyal regulars.\n",
      "I hate to say it, but the cafe here is awesome! I had a really good meal everytime I went here for super cheap. The Reuben is really good. It's small, but nice. I like the murals. The bar is cool. You can basically get free alcohol for doing the small slots. Good way to get buzzed, possibly win some money, and leave happy. TRY THE FOOD!\n",
      "Love to gamble here, the restaurant is really good, breakfast lunch and dinner. Pasta night on Monday and the smoke food here are great. Love it here.\n",
      "There doesn't seem to be a separate entry for the Emerald Island Casino and their restaurant, the Emerald Island Grille. Since everyone else is combining their reviews I guess I will to. First the Casino. The three casinos in the downtown Henderson, Water Street area (the other two being El Dorado and Club Rainbow), are three of the loosest casinos in the Vegas area in terms of pay tables, and Emerald Island is no exception. They advertise themselves as the only \"all penny\" casino in the Vegas area, meaning that every machine has a penny denomination option. Don't let this worry you too much if you like to play bigger stakes, as you can usually play well over a 100 pennies at a time, and many machines offer the option to change to higher denominations. They definitely cater more towards the \"low roller\" gambler with a more frugal gambling budget, even if you can play higher stakes. They comp drinks at a very low 20 cent average and you qualify for most of their promotions with an average bet of the same. One weird thing about the Emerald Island is that it is the Casino where I have seen payouts go down on some of the higher denominations, which is unheard of and usually the opposite is true. On the machines at the bar the payouts on one cent and two cent are pretty high, but switch to five cent and they drop. Casino owners usually want to encourage higher denomination play as they turn a bigger profit on it, so this makes no sense. Stick to the lower denominations and up your bets there if you want to make bigger bets. They have no table games (none of the Water Street Casinos do) and one long bar inside. One downside to this place is that there are a lot of smokers, espicially at the bar, which is where I prefer to play. On the upside the bar does have some drafts from Lovelady Brewing down the street, which they comp, and that is a huge plus to playing here in my book. They also periodically walk through the Casino with snacks, like a tray of cookies, for players, though this doesn't seem to happen too often. The players club doesn't offer free play, which is a downer, but they do have more point earning promotions and \"spin the wheel\" style promotions than any place I have ever seen. They advertise themselves as having a promotion everyday, so make sure you check with the players club before you start gambling to see what's going on. On many days you might get to spin a wheel for extra cash if you hit a certain keno hit, slot amount or video poker hand. They also have some crazy point multipliers that range from 25 times to 100 times your normal earnings. We played for an hour during a 75 times multiplier and earned almost fifty dollars in comp between us for the Cafe, which is by far the fastest I have ever seen comp dollars accumulate. If you want to eat for free, this is the Casino for you. On the the restaurant. The Emerald Island Grille is the only Casino on Water Street that has a 24/7 dining option. Their graveyard specials are pretty low priced and they have several options every night, including breakfast and burgers. Almost every night has a theme to it, and we've been here for BBQ night and Italian night. We were shocked by the quality on both nights considering this is a casino cafe. The Italian sausage pasta and linguine and clams were both amazing. The BBQ sampler was worthy of a real BBQ restaurant and had five meats for 16.99, including the best hot link I have ever had for BBQ. My wife got the brisket sandwich and it was also fantastic. They even had Pecan Pie as a special desert for the BBQ night. Their theme night food is worthy of five stars, but funny enough their normal dining menu hasn't impressed us that much. I got the ribeye here once and it wasn't even a ribeye... I got the double cheeseburger special one time, and it was OK, but nothing special. They have decent breakfast to. Their prices are typical for a diner, and are a little bit higher than the other Casino Restaurants nearby that offer dirt cheap prices for everything. This is probably due to the crazy rate gamblers can earn food comp here if they gambler during the multiplier times. The service here has always been great and very friendly. In conclusion, the Emerald Isle is better than your average locals casino, especially if you are a low stakes gambler. Their biggest downsides are that they can be smokey and you don't earn free play, but they have very good craft beer and a good restaurant you can earn comps quickly for. I wouldn't drive across town to come here, but if you live nearby I would check it out.\n",
      "I live in Las Vegas and I can go anywhere. I go to Emerald Island a couple times a week. The gambling is fun and the slots aren't so tight that you never win. The people are wonderful and the service is great. And the food is remarkably good. The restaurant gets very busy and sometimes the wait time is long! I have never been disappointed there. Here's the difference. They treat their customers well. They feed everyone in the casino. One night it was chicken wings, and another egg rolls. The servers just come around and give them out. Sometimes ice cream cones or hot fudge sundaes. The comps are generous. They want you to have a good time and come back! The employees and the people playing are happy and smiling! Great atmosphere. It's old and kind of kitschy. But it reminds me of how Vegas used to be before casinos became big corporations. And that's a good thing!\n",
      "I saw a sign publicizing a breakfast special of 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon and 2 pancakes for $2.22 at the entrance to the creatively named Emerald Island Grille that we ordered knowing neither of us would be able to clean our plates. Considering the locale and clientele, our meals turned out to be better than expected and, at that price, a definite steal, but when I received our check it was priced at $3.99 each. I brought the mistake to the cashier's attention and after much back and forth followed by my re-checking the sign, I realized the name of the special was 2-2-2, not the price. Oh my, sometimes it ain't easy being a senior. A rating of 2.5 would be more appropriate.\n",
      "Very Small Casino Located in Old Henderson. The restaurant here is small and Has a nice vibe to it, very comfortable and homey in a way. I came here for breakfast with my family. We received good service, people are friendly. Prices are really good too, my plate was only $3.99 for Scrambled egg, hash browns sausage and toast. The Ideal Breakfast for the Ideal price! They also have Cinnamon french toast for like 4 bucks, OMG. There Over all menu is pretty awesome, they have all kinds of things. on a budget or not this is a good place to come to. I will be back !! A place with a good breakfast / lunch menu is a place for me.\n",
      "There's nothing like gambling at the Emerald Isle Casino! I love the theme of an all Pennies locals place. They have a large selection of new and old slots, along with progressive slots. There are USB charging stations at the bar. We also got drinks at the bar, and they were much larger and stronger than other casinos normally serve. A nice place to play!\n",
      "Yep, it's DIVE time! I present my third and final installment of Water Street dives. Much like the Rainbow Club and El Dorado the Emeral Island Casino caters to locals offering great food at an affordable price and an all penny casino, for the budget conscious gambler. Emerald Island creates a much more lively atmosphere that the other two dives mentioned above. They have a very outgoing staff that does a fantastic job of promoting their brand and informing customers of the promotions going on. Their dining area is relatively small, but has a lot of great quality items (Steak & Lobster Fridays are solid for $20, tacos are outstanding, can't go wrong with their burger or any of their subs). They advertise that \"everyday is promotion day\" at Emerald Island. If you join their players club they sometimes have up to 25x's points. You don't have to be a mathematician to know that adds up very fast. $5 will literally get you a few bucks off your meal. They also give out free food daily between 6-7pm. Some nights its Baskin Robbins ice cream, other nights it's Tacos, you just never know what delightful little treat they are going to serve up. Of the three Henderson dives the Emerald Island is probably my favorite for a nice little evening of gambling and dinner. All three are within walking distance of one another so check out one or check out all. Much like the other two, be prepared to strip down in the garage when you get home as the smoke-is-a-heavy at Emerald.\n",
      "Gotta try the seafood Mac and cheese special on Saturday night it's the cheesiest macaroni With big hunks of lobster it comes served in a big giant bowl and I'm not exaggerating when I say giant lol so be prepared to ask for a to go box :)\n",
      "Simply good food at a very good price! It is very surprising for a small casino to be honest. We have been here 3 times in March and has been a delight!\n",
      "Good coffee. Food took a bit, but it was good. The decor of the place is fairly horrible, but the breakfast is good and cheap. Cheap! Good! Coffee!\n",
      "Place is just bad. Went here because the wait at the Rainbow was over a half an hour. Got right in here. There is a reason for that.... Service wasn't bad but the food was horrible. I will never go back. I will just have to wait it out at the Rainbow next time.\n",
      "I don't have a lot to add to what other Yelpers have already reviewed. Clean, nice service, and quality items. Sakana-ya has a cooking / grilling stall outdoor in warmer months, you can buy the seafood from them and have it prepared right there. Grilled uni and scallops in shells are sublime. You can also get Oden skews from the same stall, not bad. Nakamura is where you get authentic Japanese-French style stuff. Imitation cheaper versions are plentiful in many Hong Kong or Taiwanese bakeries in GTA, for the REAL thing, come to Nakamura.\n",
      "J-Town is a hidden gem on the edge of Markham and Scarborough. I have lived in Markham most of my life... it was this mystery spot to me and although I knew its location, I never ventured out ...Until now - cue singing angels. It's tiny, but so much to discover... Definitely come here for the food tho. I was in the market, browsing while waiting for my friends to arrive for our lunch at Izakaya Ju. I had to refrain from buying anything... Everything was sooo enticing! All the bento boxes, desserts, fresh sashimi... They have blue fin tuna and wagyu beef - I WANT THEM! If you don't like line ups or big crowds (ie. Guu and Pacific Mall), J-Town is a nice relaxing place to hang out, do a bit of shopping and have lunch/dessert or spend some serious cash on wagyu or blue fin. Plus there's lots of parking!\n",
      "There are many great factors that make j-town amazing. The main one being the food. They serve (honest to goodness) the best japanese curry. So if you're undecided on what to get, that's a great suggestion. The western pastries are truly amazing, I haven't tasted one that I do not like. The only issue that I have would be that some of the prices are a tad higher than other places. Overall though, really great spot to pick up something to eat. Oh and one more thing, if you're in a rush don't hesitate to get it to go since they're containers are very well made (that sounds weird but it's true)\n",
      "On one of my \"vagabond days\", I tasted, compulsively, the cafeteria food at J-Town. The Nori was crunchy, fresh, light and tasty despite the strong and almost pungent vinegar. The food court had a factory-like ambiance and seemed like it was in the middle of a warehouse. In other words, not so posh. The sushi, a refrigerated takeout tray, was tasty and definitely more \"authentique\" than any other cafeteria-inspired quicky sushi.\n",
      "Much smaller than I thought. But this place has a really warm welcoming vibe. Those dishes and treats on the counter didn't really attract me, so I Went to the cafe and ordered mushroom pasta. Well, not bad but nothing special. The pasta is kind of hard, I prefer it boiling longer. The sauce is creamy , but salty. What disappoint me is that the flavor just stop at \"salty\". Nothing impressive. Their salad is good though. Really fresh.\n",
      "I am writing about just one of the restaurants situated in the main shopping complex. It is next to the Toro Sushi which is great place for sushi, by the name of Sankanaya I think. The place is under new management from the old. With many samples shown and I ordered number 3 (Chirashi, $7.99). The time was around 2pm and I was the only person there. I just had the worst Japanese food in 40 years. Chirashi I had has in total 5 slices of fish cut like thin scraps over cold rice. The miso soup was cold too, flavourless choked with cubes of tofu. The salmon has a foul smell and is rotten. It is a disgrace to J - town and makes me feel like I was cheated by people who think they can get away it and think that I am stupid and not knowledgeable with Japanese food. J -Town should know that an operator like that could ruin its hard earned reputation.\n",
      "JTown is an uptown gem that not too many people frequent. They have the best french bread at the bakery and I've tried mostly all the popular bakeries in Toronto. They have Onigiri for super cheap, only $1.50 tax-in, also a butcher with premium meat and a great cafe of sorts on the other end.\n",
      "A recent visit here with a group of old school friends for a casual lunch gathering. I liked that you have so many choices when you eat at Jtown, you can either order from Cafe Green Tea (which serves home style Japanese food), or buy bento and sushi/sashimi from the other parts of the grocery store. We were here after lunch. Some of us ordered curry chicken rice and omelette rice and others got sushi and chirashi from the fish house. The sushi wasn't as cheap as Chinese grocery stores but you are really paying for the quality and the freshness. The lady at cash offered soup and because it was after lunch hours, she gave us more than one for free. The soup was very flavourful and you can see bits if salmon in the broth. After lunch we got some cakes from the bakery. Their cheesecake and green tea mouse cake has always been my faves.\n",
      "Toronto has its own little Tokyo in Markham Its a series of independent owned shops serving up food, fresh sushi grade fish, Wagu beef and other specialty items Ok so its not the Akhibara for electronics those shops are up the street BUTit is the mecca for the best in japanese food I was also able to purchase some kitchen items (yes they have a pickle press and wonderful Bento boxes) as well as a great assortment of Japanese magazines and books. I swear they must have 12 different Togarashi condiments to choose from I suggest you time your visit so that you are hungry enough to have a sit down take out meal and grab some bakery items for the ride home. The green tea cakes shaped like crabs are a must. Also the pricing is reasonable and the Miso soup packages are cheaper than the other asian stores The only thing missing from the real deal in Tokyo is you wont get run over in the fish market by the crazy Tsikiji fork lift truck drivers, you wont be ordering your ramen noodles from a vending machine and no irasshaimase greeting by kimono clad ladies Its a great shopping experience and is spread across a few buildings and the owners are super friendly\n",
      "This place is a small plaza filled with a lot of different stores and restaurants. I come here primarily for the FOOD but also for the salon and browsing Japanese magazines. Heisei mart sells a lot of Japanese brand and regular groceries although if you can get the same stuff elsewhere then do it because it's generally more expensive here. Nakamura bakery sell the best pastries that I have ever tasted (and baked fresh). I would recommend the cakes, pies, parfaits ($4) and any bun with their yummy cream. They are kind of pricy but they are also very rich in taste. The Boston cream for example is by far lighter, more subtle and creamier than any Tim Hortons doughnut and sells out pretty quickly. I also like their cheese bread and curry buns. Cafe Green Tea sells meals at moderate restaurant price. The father set ($9) which comes with a hamburger, 2 shrimp tempura, rice, potato salad, 2 slices of orange takes a while to arrive but the meat is very juicy (an I love the potatoes). The Japanese curry rice is a cheaper option ($5.98); arrives fast not to mention tastes very good. The meal comes in a nice big plate. You can also buy hot croquettes or drinks and fill a free cup of water. You can even order outside of the menu like a bowl of rice and katsu for about $5. If you're not happy with that selection, the Heisei mart sells bentos, snacks and onigiris; the butcher shop sells meat centered bentos and specialty croquettes/sides, and Tora Sushi sell fish specialty bentos, sushi, yakisoba, and croquettes; and there are other restaurants in the area as well (izakaya and ramen) although that may be pricier. The bookstore center is a great place to get import magazine related to fashion, Idols, cooking, hair and anime stuff although be aware that it's all in Japanese which is fine with me. Some of the magazines are really expensive though when you compare the original Japanese price (more than double). I go to Studio T occasionally to get $30 regular cuts (kind of pricey). I find that coming with a picture or selecting a style in a book can give you better results. There is good service: super nice hair wash, some tea during a long session, discussing the cut and also styling your hair with products to make you look good. There are of course some cons as well like price, short-lasting perms, colour accuracy.\n",
      "Great place to get all your Japanese fix/necessities. Although on the pricier side, they do have a large variety of groceries, snacks, bakery, fresh fish, meats all under one roof so it does save you the time and gas from going from place to place. Everyone is always friendly here and willing to help. Parking is a little difficult but nothing too frustrating.\n",
      "It's not as big as many of the Japanese enclaves down in the state, but hey what do you expect when our Japanese population in the GTA isn't that big? I've been down to many of the Japanese places down in LA, SF, NYC, etc. J-Town provides a good sampling for what it's worth. You have a beauty store, an anime/DVD store, a Japanese supermarket, a seafood store, a sushi store, a ramen place, a katsu place, and an izakaya restaurant. There are also various sit down tables inside J-Town if you decide to order lunch specials in the main building. Everyone inside is very attentive and speak excellent English. I mean, they have to; how many Torontonians actually speak Japanese after all? A few places also charge no taxes; the Heisei Mart being one of them. The place may be up in Markham, but if you've never been down to the states and want something close to a true Japanese community experience...this is the closest you'll get.\n",
      "This is as Japanese as it can get in Toronto when it comes to malls. It consist of a cosmetics store, bookstore, grocery store, bakery,cafe, and hair salon. kitchen ware and a small court. The service there is the best around. The food are all fresh and are as close to the taste of Japan's culinary.\n",
      "Whenever I feel as though I need to transport myself back to Japan, I go to J-Town. And invariably I end up disappointed. When this place first opened, it was awesome. I don't know if businesses have moved away, but its not the same. Even the grocery store (Heisei) does not carry the same variety they used to. The fishmonger (Sakana) is incredible and on the same level as Taro freshness-wise. No worries in that department. J-Town has so much potential - but the vibe is tired and jaded ...\n",
      "A few caveats. J-town is small. J town is expensive. J town can be difficult to navigate without a working knowledge of spoken or written Japanese. Now onto the good stuff: Bakery - when you can get it, because they sell out fast, this bakery makes the best Japanese-French style pastries. The pastries as interpreted by Japanese bakers are always more elaborate and more decorative and more delicate. You feel as if you are eating mini flower arrangement art. It can be heartbreaking to eat these as you just want to look at them. Oh, but the taste! Wonderful. Fish Market - There are two items of note in the fish market and they are likewise also not always available. It's worth asking them which day they receive their fish shipments, as I cannot recall off hand. The Japanese snapper is very expensive but has a melting flesh that is more tender than snapper from other waters. Occasionally there are small Styrofoam packages of uni (sea urchin). If you don't need the fanfare of beautiful tableware and waitresses in kimono to appreciate your sashimi then this is the right place for you. The salmon is usually of higher quality than fresh salmon you will purchase elsewhere but lies somewhere just below what I would consider optimal for sashimi. Supermarket: One standout item is the Tamaki California grown Japanese short grain rice in a foil bag filled with nitrogen to preserve freshness. Another is the bonito shavings in larger sizes than that you would find in other Asian groceries. Also, if you need a katsuobushi for shaving your own bonito flakes old school style this is the place to get it.\n",
      "Really interesting place. A large variety of fresh food, imported Japanese items and even a small cafe and restaurant with lunch and what not. The staff all seem to speak English and Japanese. The meats are a little pricey but they're fairly specialized so it didn't bother me.\n",
      "This place is like a home a way from home for me. The second best place next to going back to Japan. Don't mind the price - it is a little on expensive end.. then again, nothing from Japan is dirt cheap anyway. The service is excellent and the place is clean as you would expect from any Japanese establishment. Check it out .. you wouldn't be sorry. You have my word! ;-)\n",
      "Cool assortment of Japanese products. I wish that there weren't so many which states 'made in China'. *SIGH* They should expand bigger, since I find a lot of space lacking and it could get kind of crowded.\n",
      "I love walking around J-Town. The food court inside the main building (joining the grocery store) sells authentic Japanese food for a fair price. I only wish there were more stores to get lost in!\n",
      "When I first found out about J-Town, I was literally here every weekend. J-Town is hands down the one and only place where you get a real, authentic Japanese feel. The foods/restaurants all around are super delish, no complaints. Be sure to try the katsu/curry combo, or the Father's meal directly inside the main building! You won't regret it! The main building is split in 3 different sections. There's a section with fresh seafoods and meats, which are ridiculously pricey, and if they are actually imported from Japan ... I wouldn't actually know.The quality of the meats and seafoods look top notch though, so I guess that's a plus? The next section is the bakery and grocery area. Now this is usually what I come to J-Town for. The bakery and sweets they offer are to die for, and look and even taste like they were made with the utmost of delicacy. I find they might not be as super sweet as Chinese bakery goods, but just as good! The next section is a sit down eating area. They have a little food stall there, I can't seem to remember the name though. You just order up front, they give you a number and they deliver your freshly cooked food to your table. So be sure to have your number (which is on a plank of wood) visible enough so it'll be easier for the waiter/ress to find you! All in all, J-Town is a definite place to check out if you're ever in the area! My one issue with J-Town though, is it isn't big enough! I wish our J-Town could be as immense as California seems to have, or even like the K-Town we have here. J-Town could offer SOOOOOO much more and then some. TIP: Be sure to have some moolah on you, J-Town isn't the cheapest. And, I don't know if they're still there. But there were these 2 guys standing outside making fresh takoyaki, which is a puff pastry made in a waffle cast iron with a piece of octopus inside. It was hands down THEE best takoyaki I have ever had in my life. Absolutely worth a try!\n",
      "Homemade Japanese meals but charges a bit too much. Good bakery items but costly as well. You can most Japanese groceries not available in Chinese supermarkets, but with a cost. Sushi place is too stinky to get closer but take-out party trays with good quality of fishes. In general, it is an expensive place but you are guaranteed it is real Japanese food.\n",
      "I like to come here for their bakery! my secondary reason to come here is to get some fresh sashimi. And every time I drop in, I will browse their snacks section and check out what's interesting or if anything is on sale. They do have good promotions sometimes, and usually $1-2 dollars cheaper than what the grocery store would sell it for. Bakery section - my favourites are 1. English Truffle (it's made of fresh cut fruits, fresh whip cream and some really soft angel food cake, in like a parfait cup) They always sold out if you come in like 3pm. But you can pre-order them the day before if you are certain about getting it. 2. Chestnut Cake 3. Green Tea Red Bean Cake what so special about their cakes? Their cakes are all made with fresh ingredients, fresh cream, and they are light and fluffy! I normally take out all the cream when I eat a metro cake, but I can clean the plate for these Japanese cakes. Sometimes if you order it and pick it up on the same day, you might see them assembling one just for you, a layer of their pound cake sandwich with some red bean paste and then another layer of pound cake. Finally a light layer of frosting with light cream on the outside and some simple decoration, and it's ready to go!\n",
      "So unlike Korean Town which is an entire street/neighbourhood dedicated to Korean shops, J-Town is only a small plaza with couple stores. However, the things they sell here are super authentic and many of them are imported directly from Japan. J-Town not only as a supermarket there for some general groceries, they also have a food court and some cafes, and also a beauty store for Japanese skin care and makeup. I'm here predominantly for the food and I like how I can find some really neat Japanese snacks and cooking ingredients that I can't find at other Asian supermarkets. Their meat section is amazing and everything there looked really fresh. Some of the meats are quite pricey though but it's reasonable for the quality that it is (there are Kobe beef made from North American raised cows). The food court is meh in my opinion, not really a huge fan of their noodles and curries. It's pretty average in terms of taste and the portion isn't very big for the price you pay. Their pastries and cakes are a lot better though and I highly suggest you get some for takeout. Even though I really like visiting J-Town and buying its amazing Japanese snacks, I'm deducting one point for the crappy parking condition. There just aren't enough parking space and it's very tight.\n",
      "Their Japanese style cakes are the best cake I ever had in Toronto I found some French pastries are overpriced and too sweet, but this place has the best ratio for sugar and cream They close pretty early, and their cakes sell very well so come early if u want to buy the popular one The snacks section is pretty tiny- I prefer T&T for snacks\n",
      "Always liked coming to this joint. They got a variety of yummy restaurants. What's more is they got fresh sushi grade fish to be sold to the consumers. And other fine things that can't be found. I came here with my friends for lunch and we settled on the Cafe Green Tea, which is right next to the bakery and grocery store. I chose #12, which is curry with breaded chicken on rice. The curry isn't bad at all, pretty decent flavours but not overwhelming in terms of hot spiciness. I saw my friend gotten the egg omelette with rice and I was like WOW! That looked good! Food wise, it's decent for a cafe food. Venue, since the tables are free for all. Please do come early cause by the time noon comes around. There weren't any tables for others.\n",
      "I was all excited to visit J-Town until I got there and realized that there must be something lost in translation there since \"town\" in Japanese must mean 4 stores? And I use the word \"store\" lightly since really there were only two stores: one was a little cubby selling some authentic Japanese imports including tabi socks which I grabbed and onigiri molds, the other is a cosmetic store that has some fashions, and books (all in Japanese of course). Note that there are no cool Japanese cosmetic dothingies like smile molds, eyebrow stensils or eyelid tape - BOO. The other small spaces are occupied by a grocery/bakery store (with NO Japanese KitKats so why even exist?), a meat shop where you can get Kobe beef, and a fish shop that is also a sushi stop. Now you may be reading my review and think: hmm...hey that sounds like a lot. Now imagine all of that crammed into a space about the size of a large 7-11. That's J-Town. So really there not much for me to go back for although I didn't get to try the tea house that is on site or the sushi place which I heard has some of the best sushi in the Greater Toronto Area.\n",
      "J-Town, its lucky that this place didn't exist while I was growing up or I think I would probably have become a criminal trying to steal money just to get my hands on the tasty snacks that are available. J-Town is a Japanese groceries store that carries mostly perishables. The layout is quite interesting as there are many vendors located within the store itself. My favourite section has to be the bakery with cream puffs, to tuna and cheese buns, to a Green Tea Red Bean Bun... Yummy! This isn't where you'd go to do your weekly groceries shop as selection and variety are definitely limited. It is, however, a place to get some hard-to-find Japanese goods. If you're in the area, stop by for a browse - but I wouldn't recommend coming all the way up here just to check it out. The one inconvenient thing is that all the labels are in Japanese, and if you have to rely on the poorly-translated stick-on labels... well... I'll let you take on that challenge!\n",
      "Have been coming here for ages. It's changed quite a bit over the years, but is now a pretty good place that has a variety of shops. If you're in need of authentic Japanese stuff (mainly good), Japan Town is where to go. Heisei - The prices seem a little higher than necessary. I recently came back from a long term stay in Japan where I went to the grocery store often and noticed the very significant differences in price. FaMu - Shop here for some great meats. They also have their items packaged, which come in handy on those nights that you don't feel like cooking. FaMu also serves daily lunch specials. ¥100 Shop - A lot of good finds here. I often buy their clear plastic folders for work. Their Tupperware comes in handy as well. I could go on, but these three shops are where I go to the most. Good for: Japanese goods\n",
      "This J-Town is so small, it should be called J-Village or J-Burg--maybe even J-Hamlet--but certainly not J-Town. Where are the usual J-Town fixtures like the Japanese dollar store, roasted chestnut vendor, and teahouse evoking Memoirs of a Geisha? I guess this Japanese mall is a reflection of the Japanese population in the Toronto area; practically non-existent. But if I were the perfect Japanese housewife, I suppose I'd make the rounds at: Famu \"Natural Meats, Japanese Cuts\" for Wagyu beef and organic pork Sakana-ya for live uni, toro, and some kind of small red fish that goes for $80/lb Heisei Mart for 20 kinds of miso, Japanese curry cubes, and a gazillion bottles of Japanese condiments Or I could just be lazy and feed my family prepared foods like the potato croquettes, Hamburg steak, and sushi combos. Then pick up some eclairs and strawberry shortcakes from Bakery Nakamura. Indulge myself in a haircut at Studio T, and browse the book and video selection at the Japan Book Centre. And because all that shopping would make me hungry, I'd refuel with an offering from the oden lady out front who sells skewers of fish cakes from a big steaming kettle. That would be the perfect day in J-Town.\n",
      "Somewhat difficult to explain, but J-Town is a cluster of small businesses on the ground floor of 2-3 commercial buildings. The main portion of J-Town would be the grocery store flanked with a couple of food stalls, with seating, on either side. In between the buildings, there is a small 'courtyard' area. There's no directory, but then again, it's not really needed 'cause there aren't that many businesses here. J-Town By The Sea, which is also a food stall, sells sashimi grade fish. Other than that, I can imagine that most things at the grocery store can be found in other larger Asian grocery stores.\n",
      "J-town is a hidden gem! I love this place to pieces, their prices are moderate, and best of all they carry Japanese snacks! All the green tea snacks!! Although they are pricey compare to those you would buy in Hong Kong due tot he duty and shipping. But its worth it if you love Japanese snacks! I always get the curry rice. Its soooooo good! Also they close Mondays! So make you don't wander in there to avoid disappointment.\n",
      "I remember when my mom first found this place (8 years ago+?) It was my favourite place. I loved all the Japanese candies and everything about J-Town. I just enjoy walking around looking at everything. It's always neat and tide, which is great. From fresh veggies, to ramen to candies and snacks. Probably my favourite thing (besides the candies) is the cake. The Tofu cheesecake is to die for. It's light, creamy and nothing like tofu. You can feel less guilty about eating it too! Their mont blanc (chestnut cake) is also very tasty. I believe that all the bakery items are all made at the bakery. *could be wrong. The buns and breads are so cute, they have turtles, pandas buns filled with some sort of custard/filling. The best part about all their bakery items are that they aren't overly sweet and everything tastes fresh. The only negative comment I have is the premade food just sits there until someone buys its. Occasional, I'll grab something like a corn croquette and I can tell its been sitting there for awhile - its soggy and cold.\n",
      "Oh gosh, if only I lived in Markham... J-Town is rather small, but it's a lovely group of Japanese businesses squished together to make up this shopping centre. There's a small bakery within the convenience/snack store, and they also sell Japanese kitchenware and bentos. The baked goods are quite delicious, and I stocked up on some rare snacks to eat later on when I get back home. If you're hungry, there's a few restaurants nearby- unfortunately, they do not have the lunch menu after 3pm, and you can wait until 5pm for the dinner menu, or you can go elsewhere for food. Overall I would love to come back, but it's way too far for me to even consider visiting again, really. I also wish it was bigger- J-Town is practically the size of a peanut.\n",
      "The previous name was Fabulous Bakery and Cafe... and when you look at the signage it now says Fabulous Bar and Cafe. And that is what it is. I believe it operates as a bar cafe during the day, and I have only really experienced it at night. Nice and central being right next to Bay and Dundas, it also gets a very interesting mixed crowd being opposite the Bus Depot. You can always expect Rex the owner there in his leather vest, the nice but crass workers, and reasonable drinks, and no one will look at you like you dont belong. It's usually as place of don't belongs. Plus they are super flexible, allowing people to bring their own 'desktop computer speakers' + ipod to have a real throw down party with the music you like.. of course you should probably pre arrange that... Low key, no dress code, never without a drink, it's all you need. Relaxing and gets the job done.\n",
      "Went there for a weekend lunch. The grilled vegetable sandwich was superb, and it came with a great side salad. The interior is kind of modern and dark, whereas we sat on the patio. The co-workers ordered a club sandwich and a grilled chicken sandwich, but I think I got the better entree. 5 stars for the vegetable sandwich\n",
      "Fabulous ... fabulously mediocre maybe. As spring is now upon us in 2010 all humans have a primordial instinct to sit out on a patio with a beer in hand baking ourselves in the sun. In our recent travels in the area around Yonge and Dundas, my coworkers and I stumbled up on this establishment on the corner of Bay and Edward. Entering the red-bricked patio we took a seat in the sun on the benches backing onto the restaurant. We quickly realized that the patio itself is noticeably sloped toward the street so the bench was so high your knees were at the same height as the table! We switched to a seat where the bench backs onto the sidewalk. That was when we noticed that there were literally 5 people here, including us. Not exactly a promising start. Oh and do you like wicker furniture? I don't. The one waitress here was quite friendly in an interesting, casual talking way. She made a reference to about the crack-head walking across the street (apparently there's a crack-walk) and how she couldn't get her iPhone on the internet. Anyway, we ordered our lunches. A grilled chicken breast sandwich with a side salad for me and a shrimp linguini for my coworker. Our meals took over 30 minutes to arrive ... 30 minutes! The waitress said that the linguini took some time to cook. Indeed ... too long in my opinion. Food wise the chicken was decently grilled on a bun of some sort. The salad was of a decent portion of mixed greens bag salad. It was just okay. My buddy seemed to enjoy his pasta and there did appear to be quite a bit of shrimp. In summary this is a decent spot for a beer and catching some sun on the cheap. The food is only average. 2.5 stars if I could.\n",
      "I've lived in this neighbourhood for 5 years, but I've never been inside this place. However, last night we needed a place for last-call drinks - we had 15 minutes - and everything was closed (including, might I add, the Firkin on Elm Street, even though it says it's open until 2 am. Not cool). So when we passed by this place and there were people inside, we rushed in. Of course, they can't be penalized for having all super-drunk patrons at 1:45 a.m. But they were all older, super-drunk men. Still, everyone was friendly and the vibe was actually okay. The bartenders were friendly and the owner was floating around (or the manager), and he was really nice and friendly too. We had some Porn Star shots (classssssy) and they were the best I've ever had -- tart, not too sweet. Overall, if you're in the area (maybe getting off a bus at the terminal) and need a place to just spend 30 minutes or so - it's not awful.\n",
      "We went here due to the location, just arrived off of the Megabus and needed nourishment. Not knowing the city we went in to get some lunch. The menu was creative, the service a bit slow, but the young man working was pleasant. The portions were average sized. The Chicken tenders were pretty good. The Mediterranean salad was a nice combination of grilled vegetables with a cold salad side. We found it a little pricey, but overall a good meal. 4 entrees were $60.\n",
      "Now I know where David Lynch gets his movie ideas. This bizarro bar located across from Toronto's Greyhound bus terminal on Bay Street had next to no signage, no exterior lights and basically nothing to entice the average person walking by (which, let's be honest, isn't very many people given the neighbourhood) to come in. There was a sandwich board blocking the entrance that declared \"Private party!\", but I don't really know how many stragglers would have attempted to bypass the board had it not been there. Luckily I was invited to said party so I had no trouble getting in. At 10pm I was one of ten people in the bar and I didn't know a single person - mercifully my friends arrived about half an hour later to save me from ogling those ten fine \"specimens\". MUSIC: The music was a mix of Big Shiny Tunes 1-3 (literally) including really old songs by Soundgarden, Bush X, Green Day and Tea Party. The rest of the clientele, which consisted of 50 year old Filipino dudes, was totally into this music and there was a lot of generic grooving and head bopping. SERVERS: The epitome of \"gussied up\". There were about eight girls working and they were dressed like they were waiting tables at Ultra or Century Room. DECOR: Think \"tryhard\" hotel bar/lounge. The last resort place to hang out when you're on an offsite business trip and realize you don't really want to venture too far from your bed - easier to just stumble back into bed at the end of the night. I kept looking for an elevator that would bring me upstairs to my room in the Econolodge. Not terrible but definitely forgettable, with the exception of what I think was the owner, who spent a large part of the evening walking around with an unlit cigarette in his mouth.\n",
      "I've ordered from them a few times now, always delivery. The pizza and garlic knots are delicious, and the delivery is quick. I love that they have vegan options for my vegan friends, so there's something for everyone! The prices are good as well, and the people I talk to on the phone are always very nice. This is my go-to pizza place!\n",
      "Wow ordered 2 pizzas thinking with good reviews this would be a good spot! Oh how I was wrong! Worst pizza I've ever had I would have been better off going to little Caesars ! Very disappointed!!\n",
      "I ordered once for a delivery and I was shocked how fast they are the food was so good I got a vegan pizza and a vegan brownie both were yummy. So I decided to in and check the place out. The guy that works there idk his name is so nice and you can tell he cares a lot about his customers. I tried to order a vegan burger they didn't have any *bummer* . I know you could tell my face was blanked because I didn't know what to get but the guy offered to make me a vegan pasta that I didn't even see on the menu. I agreed to it and it was so good I was so full and satisfied. He went out of his way to make sure I had a great lunch that fit with my eating choices. I would go there again any time I do live 10min away\n",
      "We got a 14\" pepperoni pizza I'd say it feeds 3 people. The pizza was good just needs more sauce and the crust was a bit hard. We liked it plus its close to the airport. Prices are good and afordable. The staff was super friendly I'd give them 5 stars but the crust kinda took it away. Still recommend it!!!!\n",
      "This was listed as 4.5 stars but definitely fell short. We had a combination pizza and all of the veggies seemed either canned or just not fresh. I've had frozen pizzas that have better flavor. The garlic bread was nothing special either and the chocolate cannoli was bland and we didn't eat it. The one positive was that the delivery guy was very polite. If you want good pizza, this is not the restaurant for you.\n",
      "so to say this place is horrible is the least I could do... This place is a mess! They have cockroaches big and small crawling all over the silverware so please beware what you eat with because that is so unsanitary. A couple of friends I work with got some coupons from them to get $5.00 complimentary meal. Second, they kept a girl I worked with's credit card on file... And charged her fifty dollars the day after she bought her food from there. Who does that? And on top of that they mess up your order and there are really rude. I would not recommend this place. How do you know you're not eating cockroach legs or shells in your pizza? Gross right?\n",
      "This place was amazing! The service was really good and the worker was very helpful and even let us sample some of their house made vegan cheese to ensure that we would enjoy it. We didn't have to wait long before our garlic knots arrived and they were AMAZING! They came with a side of vegan ranch that was the best we've ever tasted (also made in house). Our favorite vegan pizza we've ever eaten and we're from Los Angeles. P.S. we recommend adding the vegan ricotta cheese to your pizza with onions, pineapples, and green peppers.\n",
      "Having held off our review until we are now 3-4 visits in, we are sticking with our initial impression for this rating and review. We've had the thick Sicilian and the thin New York crust. We prefer the Sicilian. Toppings have always varied as have the appetizers. Have to withhold the 5th star for the mushrooms not being fresh. They use an excellent cheese selection,, especially the feta. Cheesy garlic bread was basic, but loved as it was a reminder of some made at home. Great flavor on their ranch. Props for using all home made dressings and sauces but give the marinara a little consideration for tweaking. More pepper/garlic perhaps. Service has always been good. Joey is who I'm familiar with at the counter. He's always attentive and helpful. Willing to bake even up to the last minute before shut down! Clean and well lit seating area that I have never used. Casual but comfortable and respectable. Could bring family IN to eat and not get that super dive-y feel from the place. It is well kept. Can't rate the bathrooms since I've never used them.\n",
      "Omg. Omg. Omg! I read the reviews and wow! So the location is weird and the inside is kind of ehhhhh but omg! The owner is ridiculously nice and there is an ENTIRE VEGAN MENU. We got the garlic knots, per everyone's suggestion and so glad I did. They found the perfect dough, or made it, rather. Also shared a vegan calzone - spinach, mushrooms, peppers, garlic, black olives, daiyafoods mozzarella in amazingly perfectly cooked crispy outside soft inside dough with ridiculously good marinara sauce for dipping. Also got a spinach, garlic, tomato vegan pie with daiyafoods mozzarella. There were so many options though so it was hard to make a decision but I'm so glad we got what we did. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town. Reasonably priced and hefty portions.\n",
      "Nice view of the planes taking off, and very nice people. I had the cheese and margarita selection and cannoli. The pizza wasn't bad, but nothing I would crave. The cannoli shell was not super fresh tasting, not rancid or anything and just was a bit dense and lacked the crunch I normally like. The filling was nice though. The one extra special thing this place offers is a vegan pizza.\n",
      "Another busy day at work called for a working lunch. One of my coworkers loves this spot so we picked this spot based on his recommendation. It didn't take them too long to prepare the food after we called it in. We ordered a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Cheese Pizza, Chicken Fingers, and Garlic Knots. I typically don't care for chicken on pizza, but the Buffalo Chicken Pizza was a solid option. It had great flavor and nice heat that you'd expect from a dish with buffalo sauce. The Chicken Fingers were fine. The Garlic Knots were warm and buttery. I enjoyed those. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was definitely the highlight of the items we ordered.\n",
      "Amazing vegan options. Vegan pizza, garlic knots, calzone, stromboli, sandwich, brownie, and more. I've only had their vegan pizza, but it really hits the spot. My non-vegan friend LOVED the brownie. (And he's extremely skeptical of vegan food). The employees there are also really nice! The first time I went there, I accidentally left my purse. When I called them, they had kept my purse behind the counter, and were really considerate about it. Love this place!!\n",
      "We were staying at the nearby Hampton Inn and needed a place to eat that didn't require a car. Fortunately, Pizza Company was just 3 blocks away. We ordered their \"unlimited pizza\" which lets you pick any or all of their toppings. A good deal and the pizza was made entirely from scratch. Nice crispy crust and a generous helping of toppings. It was served piping hot from the oven. We also ordered their Greek salad and it was loaded with kalamata olives and feta cheese. The owner and his helper were really friendly too. Definitely worth visiting again.\n",
      "Very mediocre food and bad service. We got there around 8:45PM and it looked like it was about to close. When we went to order (we were dining in), the guy taking our order seemed to act as if I weren't standing right there waiting to order. After he realized I wasn't going away, he reluctantly took my order. I got the all meat pizza with garlic knots and wings. Pizza was ok, mostly because the cheese and salami were good. The meatball was just awful and almost ruined the pizza. Only lots of ranch and crushed pepper saved this one from complete failure. Wings were good but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home with a bag of frozen Tyson wings and a bottle of Frank's hot sauce. Last but DEFINITELY least, the knots were totally burnt on the bottom! The guys working in the back didn't even wait for us to finish leaving the building before turning off the lights. With that said, I highly recommend you do not eat at this place unless you already got the Groupon like I did... In which case, just get it to carry out because the service is unacceptable.\n",
      "Tasty pizza, good value and good service. Don't overthink it, go to Pizza Company!\n",
      "Just another Pizza of place in Vegas looks really old even is known that really old part of town plenty of parking in the front two empty business side by side it's kind of cool how you can go to the driveway to the apartment complex on the west side that way you can exit West on Sunset other than that yeah that's it\n",
      "Stunned at the high reviews. Called in for small 2 topping & told 15 minutes. Got there in 10 minutes & told it's going out in the oven now. I sat & waited, watching my pizza sit, while a couple phone orders came in. It finally gets put in the oven & I try pay for it so I could go when it was done. Nope, not gonna happen....keep making pizzas & when I tell you I want to pay now, tell me to hang on a minute. Then I finally pay & you take my burnt pizza out of the oven. Professional pizza making man, you knew my pizza was burnt & put it in a box & handed it to me. I almost drove back to give it to you & tell you that's pretty sh***y to give me a burnt pizza. It might have been ok if it wasn't burnt, but I won't be going back to see. Anyone caring about the food they are serving, wouldn't have served that pizza. Waste of my time & money.\n",
      "We love Pizza Company!! We pick up pizza from them almost every other week. Pizza is great! Also love their garlic knots and meatball sliders. It is usually ready pretty quickly and the owner is always super nice when I come in! Definitely would recommend!\n",
      "Absolutely fantastic Sicilian-style pizza. Pillowy thick inside and crunchy crust. Garlic knots are also great. Got it delivered and it was still fresh and hot, not soggy at all. Very pleased.\n",
      "The pizza is excellent!! The owner is so friendly. The location is weird but my kids enjoyed watching the planes take off and land. We'll be coming here every time we are in Vegas. Ü\n",
      "I was surprised to see that they had vegan options, I ordered 3 vegan burgers with fries and their vegan brownie. It was so good! I am glad that I found this little place. The food is so yummy! And the owner is really nice and helpful. I've been back 3 times and I love it! It has the small family business feeling and the owner is really nice. My whole family likes this place now too!\n",
      "BEST FOOD... I always go here it's amazing! Their prices are perfect too!!! If you do go here you will have to get a Cannoli!! Tastes like it is straight out of New York!\n",
      "Good food friendly and fast service! Love that they have a lot of variety on their menu and that they deliver...so no matter what mood I'm in I can find something I want on their menu plus the convenience of delivery! Got chicken fingers with fries, garlic knots and a slice of cheese cake for later and it totally hit the spot.\n",
      "My husband is a cheese lover and I'm a vegan so sometimes it's hard to find a place that will satisfy us both. Pizza Company makes pizza night something we both look forward to. Their vegan pizza is comfort food for me and something I end up ordering on the regular. I used to bring my own vegan ranch for dipping but recently the owner started making his own. It is SO GOOD. When I get pizzas for my office I will get extras of the vegan ranch and everyone, even the meat and dairy lovers, raves about how good it is. The vegan brownies are seriously good too, better than even most vegan restaurants. My hubby who is not really into baked goods will even devour one by himself! Their cheesecake is yummy too and something I get cravings for. The vegan ziti is pretty good, not amazing but definitely will hit the spot if you're in the mood. Oh but the garlic knots So good. You can tell they are so much better quality than any type of garlic bread or similar product you would get at a chain like papa Johns or dominos. Speaking of which, they are a small business and the owner is very involved. He listens to his customers and does his best to offer the things we want. One of the ways he does this is by using the ingredients he thinks are best, even if it costs him substantially more than a similar ingredient would. He buys fresh spinach instead of frozen and brand name vegan products even if he can't get them at wholesale prices. Pretty awesome if you ask me. Oo and sometimes they run specials on their vegan pizzas too!\n",
      "I went here because a friend recommended the place. Using 90210 iZigg services we got the free small cheese pizza offer. Since I was on that end of town I figured why not try it out! I'm all about free! SInce the place smelled amazing when we walked in I decided to be a good customer and also order the garlic knots. I had to laugh when the owner said he would be making them fresh, did we mind waiting 10 or 15 minutes? FRESH GARLIC KNOTS? OK, force me to wait! The cheese pizza of course was finished before the knots, so we decided to sit there and eat it. Upon discovering just how YUMMY the pizza was I promptly went back to the counter and ordered a large pepperoni to go! No way was I going to drive nearly 30 miles back home and NOT have any pizza with me! A gentleman came in while we were waiting for the large pie and he ordered a SLICE! I did not even notice that they sold pizza by the slice, but my daughter says that's because I am old and won't wear my glasses! ANYWAY! He stood there eating his slice and when the owner asked if he would like to sit he said NO, I don't live anywhere near here and just come to eat this one slice! It's that good! (His words.) Well, of course that made me happy! I was sure I would be glad I took that large pizza home with me! I must confess, even the next day, reheated pizza was delicious! The garlic knots could have used just a touch more gartlic for my taste and I didn't care for the marinara dipping sauce (too sweet) but the overall experience was worth it! Highly recommend this place to anyone on the south end of town. We did also enjoy watching the planes land since we are right across the street from McCarran's runway! I may not drive clear across the planet for this place, but anytime I am out south I will definitely stop in! Oh and I almost forgot the prices were quite reasonable. Like I said earlier I am all about FREE and getting the large pepperoni for only $8.95 was a bargain!\n",
      "I had the veggie roll & it was delicious! Staying in a hotel close by & the delivery service was speedy & so polite! Thank you Pizza Company! Yummy!!\n",
      "Two words: garlic knots. So darn good. And the pizza was great too. They have Daiya cheese for vegans. Not to mention, the owner is a wonderful person, big smile, super-friendly and nice, hard worker.\n",
      "Had the groupon and had heard good things so I decided to give it a try. Garlic knots are acceptable. Marinara is unremarkable. Pizza is disappointing. The method used is blatantly the same as costco's, ball of dough squashed in a press. Toppings are sparse and really there is just no flavour. Service was friendly enough but yeah, skip it and go somewhere else.\n",
      "I honesty wish I had never found them. Seriously addicted!! Vegan options are AHmazing!!! The ranch dressing is ridiculously good!! Add that to your pizza don't forget a brownie and watch out waistline!! SO good!!!\n",
      "Fantastic small hole in the wall pizza place. The staff is so nice and friendly, and the pizza is fantastic. Wife and I had the vegan pizza and it was soo much better than we imagined.\n",
      "Considering I can't rate it on taste, because it never arrived, I rate it a one on customer service. I called at 8:26pm, the person who took my order seemed hesitant, I guess because they close at 9. However, he took my order and told me it would take 24 minutes. Well it never showed up. No one tried called me and I called the restaurant multiple times. I'll never have the opportunity to try them, they ruined the. experience for me.\n",
      "Their vegan pizza is amazing!! I've been on the hunt to find a delicious, dairy-free pizza with a great crust and plenty of fresh toppings. For Vegas, Pizza Company is it! Although it's not on the menu, they do offer fresh basil This place doesn't skimp out on their toppings either My only regret from this place is that I didn't get the name of the worker who was there when I picked up my pizza. He informed me that they sometimes make specialty desserts like Vegan Tiramisu, and they sell out quick when they do. He also let me sample their Vegan Ricotta which is not on the menu and is a special request. It was delicious! This place is a great option for Vegans, people with dairy intolerance and or allergies like myself, and anyone who wants to taste something new. My boyfriend who can eat dairy with no problem even liked my vegan pizza. Pizza Company also offers vegan ranch and it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I agreed that the taste was better to us than normal ranch; however, it doesn't have the same consistency. Who cares about that when the flavor is so good! Thank you Pizza Company and the gentleman that gave me a very memorable experience. I will definitely be coming back again!\n",
      "Just had me a lunch spcl (2x slcs and a 12 0z can for $5 and change) and it was mediocre aaiight. It wouldn't hurt if the dude making the pies wear at least a pair of light plastic gloves if he's multi-tasking in touching the cash register and grabbing the counter pens, etc; They think they slick by chopping a full slice in 2 so the joint was about size of your palm of your hands that fit into a itty bitty pizza box. Probably it was their sauce but I found it a bit salty and it was HELLA greasy, had to go hit up Planet Fitness after. Comes down to getting simply what I paid for, but for over all courteous srvc, the 2 dudes there were super white people polite nice and not evil. Can't complain ;)\n",
      "Great little hole-in-the-wall pizza joint. Great lunch deals and pizza is New York style thin and tasty. Love to put a little oregano on it and fold. Check out the $1 slice Monday lunch special!\n",
      "Absolutely favorite vegan pizza spot and all of our non-vegan friends love the pizza here as well. Great people who work here make the experience even better. No other place has vegan pizza like this place!!!\n",
      "They have a Gluten-free crust. It's an eight inch for $11.99. Yeah it's the price of a large pizza, but oh well. It's nice and hot with a nice crispy crust and your choice of one topping. Addition toppings are extra. I also ordered a medium Hawaiian pizza for the nieces and a large pepperoni with Jalapeños for the hungry husband. Both looked great!\n",
      "Thanks to all those who posted reviews. Since we're a stones throw away at the La Quinta, we thought we'd try pizza tonight. We ordered the margarita and pepperoni pizzas along with a Greek salad. The margarita pizza was a bit lacking in flavor, we'd rate it 3* but the pepperoni pizza was great at 4 stars. The NY pizza crust was excellent, along with good pizza sauce. The pepperoni was very good quality, not your usual greasy kind like at the corporate chain pizzas like Domino's, or Costco. the salad was good, fresh and we got the balsamic dressing and that was 5*. The two guys who were working, were very friendly and courteous-if only this was the norm and not extra ordinary.....it's a real joy to interact with people who love their jobs, it makes it a great experience, when it's food, it really adds to the enjoyment and you want to come back. It sucks when the people are good but the food is not, or vice versa. But not at this pizza place....\n",
      "I have ordered from this place several times. Each time the delivery was quick and the food was great! Definitely recommend!\n",
      "Amazing food and service. I ordered a pizza and wings for delivery. Wings were hot and crispy and delicious, pizza has a great amount of toppings and tastes fresh and arrived hot, the way pizza is supposed to be. I called in my order and was helped by Joey. Friendly and even offered me an extra 10% off... I don't know why? Maybe because I was referred by the hotel or that I am here for work? Greatly appreciated and NOT forgotten. That is how you keep people coming back. Thank you! I will order this pizza again, no doubt about that. Oh, and it was here within 30 minutes and arrived with plates, all the sauces I ordered, cheese and red peppers. Kudos!\n",
      "The Pizza Co. is a great little restaurant with excellent customer service and delicious food! I stopped in after work and was greeted by 2 very friendly and outgoing owners. They made me feel really welcome and comfortable right away. I ordered a small pizza and salad that were awesome. Everything tasted fresh and you can tell they use quality ingredients, I just wish the pizza had a little more cheese cause it was really good. The salad was made with fresh greens not iceberg lettuce and even came with garlic knots..yummy! They kept checking with me to make sure everything was good and even gave me a couple of cannolis for free because it was my first time there. The food was delicious and the service unusually excellent. We will definitely be going back. If you want great quality pizza and great service, go to The Pizza Co.\n",
      "Owner was friendly and food was awesome. The garlic knots was light and fluffy in the inside and crispy on the outside. I ordered the white pizza and was awesome, especially with the fresh basil on top.you can tell the owner ,Joey, really cares about his food and customers. The pizza crust was on point and tasty with thwur housemade ranch. This place is a little hidden, so be careful not to miss it =).\n",
      "Can I just say... Yum?! I loved the pizza place on 215/Flamingo that had these custom pizzas and now I found a replacement :) The Pizza Company offers vegan and gluten free options, and the employees were very helpful. I ordered a traditional crust, with vegan cheese ($2.00 more) and also vegan sausage and chicken. The vegan sausage is definitely the way to go! Really great service and some good pizza... It was a lot of food so I ate it over two days :)\n",
      "I highly recommend this place!! The white pizza was very good!! Good atmosphere and friendly service!! Francisco was very helpful and friendly!!\n",
      "Been there once with hubby. We had vegan baked ziti and garden salad. It was very good and the staff was particularly pleasant. Pros: +vegan options including vegan pizza, veggie burger, and vegan baked ziti +reasonable prices +friendly staff Cons: -delivery zone must be small (we live close but aren't in the delivery zone) -hole in the wall location, no place to take a client or date -use paper plates, plastic forks, etc.\n",
      "Surprised to find a place like this still around, food is brick oven cooked and of the seven times I've had it always made to my expectations. Good food, made in a reasonable time period with great customer service. What more could you ask of a pizza place. For pizza prices are a bit high but the quality and taste are worth the extra 1-2 dollars.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful Vegan items!!! The best Vegan Pizza, lots of flavor and the service was top of the line. I'll be back for more, I hope to try the stuffed Stomboli next visit.\n",
      "This is my FAVORITE pizza place in vegas. And when I saw it only had 3 and a half star, I created a yelp account to review them. The pizza is fantastic, always fresh and delicious. The staff is nice and remembers me and my friends even when we hadn't come in to eat for months. The food comes out pretty quick for being made on the spot and they have a lot of food items on their menu besides pizza. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.\n",
      "I've been getting stuff from this joint maybe once or twice a month now over the past 3 months. The pizzas are still good (consistently) but I think their pastas are gross now. Chicken parmesan was a big miss with worst breaded flat chicken ever and their alfredo was wayyyyy too garlicky. I love their chicken fingers and it's now my favorite thing to order. I'm wondering how slow the business is because the ranch sauces I was given were labeled \"9/27\" but it was definitely from 9/2 with the 7 added just today with a different pen. Not to mention it was pretty watery.\n",
      "Not bad. We went there while waiting to renew passport for our daughter. Food was pretty good, though not very fast (guess you can't be with fresh-made-from-scratch). Wings were tasty and the calamari was okay, but it was on greens which quickly got soggy and hence not very edible. (Don't recommend calamari to go...) Their specialty seems to be delivery, but they do have places to sit (almost as if an after thought...\"Hm. Guess we should put up a some tables and chairs to sit on...\") Guys were nice, but it seems that only one person takes orders and if he's on the phone, then you don't get helped. Kind of weird set up. Needs work on system for taking orders. They seem new at the restaurant business... Food quality was good, but the \"delivery\" wasn't great (see comment about calamari above). Haven't tried pastas and such, but probably a good place to get food for football watching parties. Not a lot of sitting room for parties there.\n",
      "The Pizza Company has an A+ in my book. Not only do they offer extraordinary tasting pizza, the owner(s) are accommodating and friendly. Thank you, Pizza Company! Las Vegas needs you.\n",
      "Great prices for great pizza! We always order pizza and hot wings. I have also tried their garlic knots. Everything is super delicious and everyone that works here is so nice and friendly!\n",
      "We walk in and they great us right away. Ya he was busy but he was still made us feel welcomed. We choose it because they had vegan options so we checked it out. Well there they even told us they had vegan ranch. There vegan options are on the shy side but they were all delicious. For the non vegans everything else it good. We got the pizza and burger and they were so good.\n",
      "This place is awesome, i didn't even care that it was delivered late cause they're under staff, but the food was hot when delivered, the serving was more than i expected and it taste so good. And thank you for letting me know that it's gonna be late delivery (which i understand) unlike other places that doesn't care. So keep it up and for sure i will order here again. Thank you again!\n",
      "Not bad at all. This is our first time here but we will be back. Glad to have a descent, local pizza place nearby. We had their spinach calzone, turkey club and buffalo chicken roll. I am anxious to try other stuff, especially their Vegan pizza. Atmosphere is a little make-shift but You should stop in and try it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "My family and I made this am every other Friday staple . we have had friends who are now regulars. Why you may ask? Well there pizza is incredible! The taste is great and ingredients are perfection! Its made to order and even taste good re heated the next day! The staff there is friendly and owner makes an effort to remember you and make conversation! When you walk in the atmosphere is cozy! They have spicy buffalo chicken breast that are really great and I eat those every time! There ranch is where its at, fresh, rich and delicious! Overall this is my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas !\n",
      "Whoo hoo!!!!! VEGAN PIZZA AND ENTREES :) Vegan pizza with Daiya cheese and up to 3 veggies, vegan baked zita with Daiya, vegan calzone. Very nice, friendly and knowledgeable counterhelp. Only drawback is they don't offer vegan pizza by the slice. Wish they would do so as well as offering \"meat\" options such as vegan pepperoni, chicken etc. I got a small (8\" 4 slice) green pepper olives and mushrooms. It only took about 10 minutes to bake it. It smelled wonderful on the drive home; tasted wonderful when I ate it. Sauce is not an overwhelming tomatoey taste which is great, as I can't stand tomatoes. Would be nice i they could develop a vegan dessert (cannolli or cheesecake). I will be back.\n",
      "THANK YOU to Pizza Company. It's very rare you find a takeout place that pays this close of attention. They noticed that my whole order was Vegan (vegan brownie, vegan bites) except that my order of a Greek salad with the feta. JUST TO MAKE SURE they made sure to put the feta cheese on the side and made the garlic knots vegan also after seeing my whole order with vegan options. This was extra initiative on their part. JEREMIAH (I'm assuming), the delivery guy, caught this.... It's great to see that they went that extra step for customer service! Thank you Pizza Company for being so awesome!\n",
      "The vegan pizza is excellent! Thanks Joey!!\n",
      "Very good service. Little bit out of the way. Great prices for the quantity of food served. Chessy garlic bread very good. Thick crust pizza good.\n",
      "100% best pizza in vegas. Love love love love this place! The owner is the nicest dude ever and super acommodating to vegans. Every employee is always super nice and great. Love this place!\n",
      "One star because it's food and it was delivered otherwise it would be no stars. Delivery guy was delightful and the food is way below average. Pizza crust was soggy and topped with not very fresh tasting ingredients, sauce was flat, garlic cheesy bread looked like my 10 year old made it and tasted like it too...and chocolate dipped cannoli had no taste in the chocolate or the filling- so much so me and my guest took one bite, and threw it out...and we really wanted to like it!! I don't know what else to say other than I have NO clue how this place gets 4.5 stars... If you have taste buds... Pick another place..\n",
      "I've dropped into The Pizza Company from time to time over the last year or two - always a wonderful experience. I met a friend of mine here for lunch today. I always enjoy my visits here, and marvel at the fact it isn't totally packed in here. The owner is always there, and is always friendly and attentive. They have a rockin' thin crust pizza here, that is among the best in Vegas, and their wings ARE THE BEST I've had in Vegas. This is a small place, only 6 or 7 tables, but the atmosphere is very comfortable. As a few of the tips say, you can subscribe to their text alerts and receive specials and promotions via text. That's what I took advantage of today - their Dinner for 2 (even though it was lunch): A large 2-topping pizza, 6 wings, and 6 garlic knots for $14.99 - this is a limited-time special, but they offer similar specials via text alert all the time. The only minus is that I wish they offered fountain drinks instead of (or along with) canned and bottled drinks. If this place was more convenient for me, I would be here all the time. At any rate, it is well worth a drive across town to enjoy their food!\n",
      "These guys are awesome!! The ingredients they use is top notch! I have never had a greasy pizza or any problem at all. Any thing you get from the pizzas to the appetizers are great! Thanks Joey your da man!!\n",
      "Awesome selection of items. Love the Vegan options as well as delicious options for the meat eaters. Also love that Every time I visit here, the owner is right there cooking and doing everything like his workers. Great customer service and willing to customize ingredient variations.\n",
      "I'm going to give this place a solid 4 stars. I ordered delivery. They told me 45 mins, it actually came in about 30 mins I ordered a large pizza cooked well done and crispy, which they did. I also ordered wings, with hot sauce on the side, which they also did. i got what i asked and paid for, so i am happy with that. Food was pretty good. It didn't blow me away, that almost never happens in Vegas due to the mostly non-discerning folks who live here. Most people here are really into chains, which personally i despise. therefore there's not a whole lot of collective demand for stuff to be exceptional here. but it's all good. i will probably order from here again.\n",
      "If you want whole ingredients and delicious pizza, The Pizza Company should be your go to. I'm in love! All the ingredients are nice and even and the crust is bomb. You can't go wrong. Mmm... my belly is so happy. :)\n",
      "Just wanted to say that these guys are awesome every time I order from them. They know my name, are always friendly and even indulge my little idiosyncrasies... (I like the jalapeños diced up instead of sliced.) Thanks guys for always being so rad and making the best pizza in Vegas! *I highly recommend the Hawaiian with jalapeños, garlic knots and the house made ranch is delicious!!\n",
      "Close to hotel we're staying at. Ate in first night. Small place, but good pizza and salads. Had take out 2nd night. Inexpensive good food and good service. Nothing fancy, but a great option for a hungry crew.\n",
      "I have been to this establishment numerous times. I have tried their pizza compared to others and I keep going back. The crust is amazing, chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Just how I adore it. Their pizza with only mushrooms is my go to favorite. I also like the buffalo chicken. I have not had a bad pie here. Joey and Victor are always in a good mood, kidding around, having fun. They like what they do. The atmosphere is always uplifting. So I will continue to drive the 15 miles from my house to the Pizza Company to get my fix.\n",
      "Delicious! Very fresh and NON-greasy! I had a medium Margherita and medium Antipasti salad. They even threw in a couple of the very popular garlic knots to try. Yum!! Will def order from here again. Online ordering as well...perfect for lazy Sunday!\n",
      "This is the WORST pizza ever!!! It gave my grandmother food poisoning and she had to be taken to the hospital. These people NEVER getting business from us again and I'm going to tell people NOT to eat. They wouldn't even give us a refund.\n",
      "The white pizza was the best I've ever had fresh basil amazing good new york-style pepperoni delicious thick sliced pepperoni crispy not too greasy very happy with this restaurant I would recommend it to all my friends\n",
      "Had a vegan pizza, vegan garlic knots, vegan cheesecake and a basket of fries and it was honestly one of the best pizza places I've been to. On top of that, I didn't feel like crap after eating all that food because you can tell that the food's been made fresh. The manager was very friendly and nice, and have excellent customer service. Will definitely be coming back to this place very soon.\n",
      "Vegan food is crazy delicious! And the sauce is top notch. Friendly people. We'll be back for sure!!!\n",
      "This is a great place to order from. The antipasto salad is awesome with lots of meat and cheese. Best home made meatballs I have had. Pizza and garlic knots are good. I have also tried the eggplant parmesan. The food is always Hot when it arrives. I also love the service!!\n",
      "Best vegan pizza in vegas! All handmade and the best customer service! Been here several times and it NEVER disappoints.\n",
      "First time here and it was as delicious as it sounds. Had the grilled chicken sandwich and side salad. Nice size chicken breast and doesn't taste processed. Italian salad dressing is house made. I'll be back again.\n",
      "This place is wicked awesome! I am from New York and am constantly on a good pizza hunt. I have been all over town and this place is in my top three. Add to it that I can't have milk/cheese as I'm allergic. Pizza Company has me covered! Their vegan pizza is to DIE for. They use Daiya cheese, which is a really well respected vegan alternative. My boyfriend and I also ordered the meatball sliders. Which were AMAZING. They come on sliced/toasted garlic knots. WHAT?! My boyfriend also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. He kept commenting that it wasn't a dish he would order in a restaurant since we are italian and often make it at home, but the meatballs were so fantastic he just had to try this staple italian dish. The food was incredible. Please come here. We want this restaurant a long and healthy life. Joey, the owner, is a gem and deserves much success.\n",
      "My neighbor orders from them so I decided to try it for myself. I was so disappointed after I spent $55.00 on an order. My mild chicken wings though they looked amazing had no sauce at all and we're raw inside. I ordered chicken fingers with BBQ sauce on the side they were drowning in sauce. The Caesar salad was great but I ordered a Cobb salad and opened it to find only lettuce tomato cucumber strips and cheese??? So when I went online to get the number to call it said they were closed. Hence why my order was prepared incorrectly they were trying to go home. So since I work 12 hour shifts I was unable to call the following day but the next day I called as soon as they opened and asked for the manager who basically called me a liar. He said if something was wrong I would have called back asap. I told him this was asap for me. I work 12HR days and they were closed when I realized the problem. He said someone would have been there after closing the cleaning crew was there...lol So I told him I don't want anything from you but to let you know what my first and now last experience was like. He said we'll you should have called before now. I also added I put the problem on the survey I received from eat street the (site that takes the orders) an hour after delivery you can check for yourself. He said he would check into it and get back to me. It's been a week you think he called back?? Thanks for great service!! Il be sure to spend my hard earned dollars where it's appreciated in the future!\n",
      "Best vegan pizza in Vegas!! My favorite is vegan cheese topped with fresh garlic and pineapple... Cannot go wrong with that combination! Pizza Company makes it PERFECT, and with their tasty dough and sauce, they blow all the other places out of the water!! The staff are always friendly, as well, and that's something that I really appreciate.\n",
      "It was our business's first time ordering with this company for lunch. We ended up ordering 3 pizzas : the white pizza, the works, and the spicy BBQ. The pizza was NOT GOOD at all. The chicken was extremely SALTY. The vegetables all tasted not fresh. The whole pizzas must have been sitting for awhile because they tasted old. For a first time customer this was not a good thing. So we called and talked to the owner Joey to let him know. All he said was \"sorry but a company ordered the same thing u did and they loved it and our pizza is good so I don't know what you are saying.\" Our total came to $46 and I requested to be refunded $23 because of our experience. He said \"I'm not gonna do that because our pizza is good.\" First off this is NOT how the owner of the company should handle a customer at all. You do not state over that it's good pizza and that another company loved it. Maybe they got the good pizza he was talking about but we didn't. Also as the OWNER NOT knowing how to handle a situation like this is unacceptable. He should've said sorry how can I fix it for you so that our company can be one that u recommend again. Instead he chose to argue and be rude! I would NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GROSS PIZZA PLACE TO ANYONE EVER! The sad part is I never thought you could mess up pizza but Joey and the Pizza Company proved that they for sure can!\n",
      "The food was good and the service was genuine and thorough. For our daughter, it's hard to find a place that has gluten-free crust (without eggs) and vegan cheese, let alone such a combination that tastes good to her. She loved it!\n",
      "Read all the reviews on yelp, figured this place would be great. Nope not all. Maybe if your Vegan but I don't have my pizza that way. The shop could have been a lot cleaner. Had Junk laying around the back. The staff was friendly but felt rushed when making my order. Got a supreme pizza and salad. The pizza was alright tasting but nothing great at all. Had a pool of water/grease underneath it. Made the dough taste gross. Salad was nothing better then the bag kind you can buy at the store. My husband was fine but I did have a upset stomach all night afterwards. Not worth the 25 bucks for it.\n",
      "The food was decent but the service was terribly slow. I had to get up a number of times to just grab items and our server barely checked in on us. Many other better breakfast places given the food and service.\n",
      "service is nice, food is quick. food is super bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone nor coming back.\n",
      "A friend recommended this all day breakfast place recently so I decided to come in for breakfast and it was quite good!! The waitress was amazing all throughout and gave us space when we needed it. The service was quick and the food as great. As a brief overview, this is what was ordered: breakfast burrito, omelet, and regular eggs with turkey bacon. All orders came with home fries (which are so so good), some fruit (a slice of orange, cantaloupe, and pineapple), and two pieces of toast cut in half and buttered (excluding the breakfast burrito plate!). Each table also has your sugar, sweetener, and spreads, including jam and peanut butter. Beverages ordered were tea, coffee, and French vanilla (a bit pricey for hot beverages but they were almost $3). So good though lol The only thing about my plate (three eggs, any style, with turkey bacon) is that my scrambled eggs didn't really look like three eggs at all. But that was a blessing in disguise cause I was way too full! Recommend :)\n",
      "Came here for the first time. The food was good and well priced compared to other places. The only reason why I'm giving them a 4 is because of the wait time to be seated. Once we sat down the service was great and fast.\n",
      "Went here during the week for breakfast once and enjoyed their breakfast special. Basic sausage, eggs, home fries and toast for under $6. The food tasted good, but breakfast usually does taste good wherever you go. Good serving sizes as well, nice sized sausages. Service was good. Our waitress was friendly and she came by pretty often. She only gave us one set of cutlery but it wasn't a big deal. Orange juice was outrageously expensive for Minute Maid orange juice. $3.50 for a bottle of orange juice... Giggling tomatoes charges that for freshly squeezed orange juice pressed right in front of you so personally I wouldn't order orange juice again. Inside was nice with plenty of seating. The mural on the wall was beautiful... The eyes were stunning. Bathrooms were also clean so that's always a plus! We definitely plan on going again but I plan on ordering something different - their pancake selection looked amazing! :)\n",
      "Great restaurant. Food was tasteful. Service was excellent. Portions were large. Lineup was managed well. Great option for brunch.\n",
      "Great food. BUT...if you ask for tomatoes on the side INSTEAD of home fries and toast, they still want to charge you 2 dollars. There's a principal here and I will never visit this establishment again.\n",
      "Pour up, Bacon, Head shot, Bacon... Kendrick Lamar lyrics on the wall first thing upon entering - how could I not love this place? As mentioned in other reviews, this is a modern looking restaurant in a suburban strip plaza, and seems slightly out-of-place in Mississauga. Well this definitely the good out-of-place. I visited Panagio's during brunchtime on a Sunday. They were quite busy, but I was able to get a table for 2 fairly quickly. For my order, I had the \"Huevos of the Ranch\" - their take on the huevos rancheros. The dish consisted of 2 sunnyside up eggs, tomato, salsa verde, and feta on a tortilla with sides of guacamole and home fries. Admittedly, it was my first time trying huevos rancheros, though it's been tops on my to-try list for a long time now. I really liked how all the flavours mixed together and having salsa, tortillas, and guac during breakfast was a totally new experience for me. The feta cheese was my favourite part, as it tasted firm and fresh. Will definitely be back at Panagio's in the near future - I need to try their Oreo waffles.\n",
      "Decided to go for brunch one Saturday morning and boy, this place is packed. Arrived at around 10am and after queueing for (what seemed like an eternity) an hour, we were finally seated. Ordered normal breakfasts with eggs, bacon, sausages. My family had waffles and omelette too. The food was okay but the experience was marred because of the initial long wait to get seated. It's not really the restaurant's fault that they are so popular. Having said that, I suppose if I were to go back, I'd have to schedule it in the summer when I can wake up earlier and have proper breakfast.\n",
      "It was my first time at Panagio's today and I left a fan! Panagio's was really packed at 1030 in the morning on a Sunday, as expected, with the dining room full and lineup for a table out the doors! I knew that I had picked a great place for brunch. As I was waiting for a table, I watched servers and cooks have all hands on deck to help one another out which was really great to see. Servers' shirts read different breakfast-related saying such as, \"Bacon is the main reason why I am not a vegetarian\" which was really cute. I had Bonjour Benedicts and was eagerly excited as it was my first time having eggs benedicts, EVER. Yes, it took me 29 years to finally try it! In my defense, I only started eating \"runny eggs\" about two years ago (I am a scrambled eggs type of girl). It was DELICIOUS. Being from Montreal, the smoked meat in the eggs benny was just such a great pairing. Portions are also very friendly and the price is right! Certainly recommend this place to others and will be back!\n",
      "Came here as a party of two at 1pm on a Sunday. First thoughts were this place is busier than expected (no line, but no free tables either) and has a cool contemporary layout. We ordered Oreo pancakes, Greek omelette, side of French toast, and OJ. Oreo pancakes: great with maple syrup - fluffy and good amount of Oreo chunks. Satisfied my sweet tooth :) Greek omelette: omelette contained black olives, feta cheese and onions - tasty combination, and the accompanying homefries were well seasoned French toast: maybe it's made differently as a main but these were really underwhelming... pretty bland OJ: served a bottle of Minute Maid. The menu didn't say freshly squeezed so guess that's fine Service was slow - seemed to be understaffed. We had to wait at first to be acknowledged, and then again for the bill. Overall - decent, would be fine with returning here and trying other menu items, but in no rush to do so.\n",
      "The food good was as usual , but the service was meh today! Please note: they recenlty hired a lot of new servers, and from my personal expericene, it seems like it has started to vary I was not greeted with a smile, and my server never did a table check on me( they all do at this place ) but did a table just across from me.. Why? I wonder....also they charge $2.50 bottomless but did not offer once to a refill? Server's name Vanlentina!!!!\n",
      "My partner insisted we try out this place for brunch. The place was quite packed for a Friday morning and the walls were decorated with words on a canvas that would make you laugh or rethink about food. It certainly caught my attention. I like the open kitchen that was in front of me since we sat at the high table. The service was pretty good and fast. I didn't like how they couldn't sub the cheese for another item which other places would kindly do so. The hot sauce I asked for was Tabasco sauce which I don't particularly like. Happy: The atmosphere was nice and casual. There was two tv mounted on the walls/ceilings so you can see the news which is nice. My soup was hot which is great. I don't like cold soup. It came with buttered toast which if I knew, I wouldn't want butter on them. The home fries was crispy and the right size. My partner loved his egg Benedict as he likes it gooey. My other friend was very full from his waffle, but I felt that the chicken could have been a better cut, instead of chicken strips that you can buy from a box at M&M. Not happy: The fruit portion is very small. I still love Cora's for their large portion of fruits for a breakfast place. Verdict: Overall, for the value of the price and the atmosphere, I would definitely go back to it. I just wish they can sub stuff out for other stuff.\n",
      "I went here for Sunday morning brunch with my wife. We showed up fairly early (9:30am), just as it was starting to get busy. We didn't have to wait for our table, but we probably would have if we came in an hour later. I ordered the eggs benedict (\"eggs benny\") with peameal bacon. The eggs were delicious and runny, and the english muffins well toasted (they had a good crunch). The home fries were also really tasty -- I think they use a bit of sugar in the seasoning for flavour. The coffee was decent (very drinkable), but nothing special. Overall, this is one of the better \"standard\" brunches I've had. The restaurant itself was clean, cheery, and had nice modern decor. The service was good and fast (I suspect they aim for a high turnover on Sunday mornings). The prices were all reasonable -- on the cheaper end of what you would expect to pay for brunch in the GTA. Overall, I had a very enjoyable experience and will probably return.\n",
      "Very good breakfast and the service was excellent even for a very busy morning like New Year's Day!!! Had the big breakfast with banana pancakes, delicious!!!!!\n",
      "A reliable basic breakfast spot in the west end, an old-faithful, and a solid go-to for groups, families, and people of all ages. I've visited this location several times in the last year, and while it isn't a gourmet, knock-your-sock-off experience, it's a reliable, casual, basic breakfast and brunch joint with a pretty extensive menu and lots of options to choose from (which, sometimes, might be all you really want after rolling out of bed on a Saturday morning). It's a nice, safe choice, and you really can't go wrong with a meal here. Location: Located at the northeast corner of Creditview Road and Britannia Road in Mississauga (about 7 minutes away from the Mavis Road exit of Hwy 401), Panagio's is located in a pretty busy plaza (the same one as No Frills, Tim Horton's, etc.) However, there's lots of parking available, so that shouldn't be an issue. Menu: Lots of options - both sweet and savoury. They have the usual eggs, omelettes, corned beef & hash, etc. And they also have sweet options like Oreo pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, etc. Portions for some dishes are quite large, and decently tasty (i.e. I quite enjoyed the chocolate chip + banana pancakes, although I did find their home fries a little raw and undercooked). Overall: A safe choice for breakfast in Mississauga, and the dishes I've ordered here have been decent. My one criticism is that they don't take reservations, so lines can go out the door at peak times on weekends, and it can be difficult if you want to secure a table for larger groups. Other than that, check this spot out - it's reliable, with a nice, clean modern environment suitable for groups large and small.\n",
      "This is very close to my house , I go very often, and I love their food! Good variety and taste and the staff usually try their best during rush.\n",
      "Food- Big portions!! If you're hungry and looking for a great breakfast place in Mississauga I highly recommend this one. I was feeling a benny so I ordered the Turkey Kalbasa & Swiss (comes with fruits and home fries). Hit the spot! Came with about 4 pieces of kalbasa, a poached egg on each English muffin, Swiss cheese and hollandaise sauce! Pretty good. Not to salty, filling, and flavourful! I tried my friend'a benny, the Bonjour Benny, and my friend who owned a deli shop pointed out to me that she could taste that the Montreal smoked meat was previously frozen and not fresh. Yes, a little bit of a turn off, but overall pretty good in flavour. I prefer the kalbasa if you're stuck between the two! My other friend ordered the big breakfast, and it's true to its word... it is BIG! Served as a whole breakfast with 3 eggs, home fries, sausage, bacon etc plus 2 pancakes, you're bound to be more than full + have leftovers if ordering this one! Highly recommend as well. Price- $8-20. Average pricing ranging from about $10-15! You get a lot for the quality, portion and price. Service- came here on a Sunday morning after partying all night. Line was almost out the door. Decided to wait and it surprisingly went by fast! Less than a 15 minute wait and our party of 6 was seated. When we sat down we were given water right away (as asked) and menus. Throughout we were helped with our menu, checked up upon and overall had a great experience. Verdict- if I'm ever in the area for breakfast i would definitely drop by and try something new!\n",
      "Service was great. Food was good. Fries weren't good. Place wasn't very busy. Food didn't take long\n",
      "My friend and I decided to trek out into the snow this morning to have brunch at Panagio's. A friend of mine suggested that I should go try them out and I'm glad I finally had a chance to. They have a great breakfast deal where you get 3 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage for only $4.99. However, we arrived shortly after 11 am so we weren't able to get the offer :(. We both decided to get that meal and it was served to us all fresh and hot pretty quickly. The woman serving us was friendly and made us feel welcome during our visit. Overall, it was a pleasant visit and I would definitely visit and try something different. They have a variety of choices to choose from, including Oreo pancakes :O.\n",
      "My favorite place to go for breakfast it's well priced and great service. They have amazing coffee and they have a great atmosphere Great for a date or even going out with family. It gets super busy on Saturday and Sundays morning so make sure u wake up early!\n",
      "OREO PANCAKES. That's all I have to say. No but really, this is the only breakfast place I've been to that serves Oreo pancakes! And you can bet that I ordered some! Delish!! Definitely something that you can make yourself but soo much easier when you can just order it! Wasn't craving breakfast when I came here (I know, crazy right?!), for some reason I was reaaaaalllly craving smoked meat and to my surprise, they had it on their menu! I'm drooling just thinking about it I came on a Sunday afternoon and had just beat the rush! We were seated right away in a comfy booth. Our server was friendly and food came at a reasonable time. No complaints there!\n",
      "What a great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch! So many different choices of what to eat from the usual eggs, bacon, sausage combos to pancakes, waffles, wraps, etc. They also have a breakfast special where you can get 3 eggs, 2 slices of toast and choice of bacon, sausage or ham for $5.59 before 11 a.m. Other items on the menu are reasonably priced at around $10 or so. The place is nicely decorated and clean, just enough natural sunlight coming in, not too loud and great food. I'll definitely be back to try their pancakes or waffles next time!\n",
      "A good place for breakfast/brunch Quite good choices in the menu. We had omelette with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and tomato from the create your own section. And had french toast glazed banana. Both were good, no artificial taste booster or additives. Tastes great!! The servers were very nice and service is prompt. A nice place to go again.\n",
      "My new favorite brunch spot in Mississauga. How was this gem missed? There's not much to NOT like about this place, and the fact that the wait can get quite busy shows. First of all, generous portions for reasonable prices. 1 main order is definitely enough (2 people if you have a small appetite). I ordered the Eggs Florentine (Eggs Benedict with spinach) and the Tex Mex Poutine. It was delicious. I would recommend ordering any variety of Eggs Benedict and poutine (for extra fat and flavor of course). Other people in my party were content with their egg breakfast or sandwich. Lots of varieties to choose from! Most orders come with an addictive side of homefries, therefore you will be full and won't need to order any extra sides! Great service. Wait staff are attentive and we sat there for a few hours chatting away and were never rushed out. -1 star because if there's an extra charge of $1.99 for substituting to fruit (and you don't get too much so a bit steep for fruit).\n",
      "Bustling place for breakfast on the weekend. Very interesting atmosphere: talkative, wooden tables, friendly-as-anything staff, rapid service. Food is almost as good as the place advertise; interestingly, out of the 4 of us, 3 got eggs Florentine, which was fairly well done. Would have preferred a sharper mozzarella, a less done egg and a little more flavor. Hollandaise sauce was terrific. home fries are good. Fruit?? - a piece each of cantaloupe, pineapple and orange...that's called fruit, disappointing. My friend's greek omelette looked pretty solid too. We also got an order of pancakes - pretty good.\n",
      "HUGE portions. Good food. The service was amazing. We would come back if we lived here but we were just here for business. Only negative is they don't take AMEX.\n",
      "I came here during the weekday and they appear to have specials for $5.99 which includes eggs, fruit, bacon/sausage and toast. I asked if I didn't get meat and if it would be the same price. They said it would be so value wise, I didn't think it was worth ordering without meat. I decided instaed on the Eggs Florentine because who can resist poached eggs? Definitely not me. Well, the dish was okay,the eggs were poached well, but the Hollandaise sauce was quite bland. It also came with hash browns, which tasted amazing. Loved the seasoning on them. Verdict: It's your typical breakfast diner joint. It doesn't have a lot of specialized dishes, but it will do the job for a diner-type breakfast.\n",
      "Was craving breakfast so decided to check this place out. It was super packed when we got there with a lineup at the door but the service was pretty efficient and we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Read a few reviews while waited in line and it seemed like everyone was ordering their chicken and waffles and pancakes. We opted for the Panagio's breakfast which was totally worth it for the portion size and my fiancé created his own omelette. My big breakfast came with home fries, 2 sausages, egg, bacon, toast and 2 pancakes! Totally worth it for the price. The only thing I would say they were lacking was flavour in the eggs. Considering how busy they were, the food came quick. Overall, pretty good service and food. Would definitely come back to try their other grill items.\n",
      "Had to update my review because the service was much better. I didn't have to wait for my drink or utensils!! Tried the spinach and feta omelet..soo good...my mom had the classic French toast..another win. Plus, the fruit it comes with is actually fresh. I'll keep coming back as long as the service is good!\n",
      "I've been here twice not, and it's not bad, but the food is quite... average. It's not super cheap but you do get large portions, especially for the \"Big Breakfast\" sets. (The $2 upgrade to the French Toast is probably worth it though!) I think if I were to go back for a visit, I'd try the Oreo Pancakes that everyone's been talking about.\n",
      "My favorite breakfast place hands down!!!!...the ambience is warm and inviting. The food is fresh and tastes divine.\n",
      "Great food! We ordered a number of different dishes from the menu and we all enjoyed everything. We got the following menu items: - Grilled cheese with poutine - Grilled cheese with home fries - Waffle with strawberries and whip cream - Greek salad - French Toast - omelette with home fries and toast Grilled cheese melted in your mouth. Poutine had the right amount of gravy and cheese ratio. The service however needs improvement. We got served coffee in dirty cups that had lipstick stains. When we asked for other cups it took about 5 minutes to get. Please clean comes properly before giving to customers. We will come back and try other items.\n",
      "First time coming here. Food and service was great. We had the bacon waffle and the cluckin' good and some hit chocolate. Will definitely come here again and recommend it to others.\n",
      "Very good place for breakfast or lunch. Menu is quite large and has lots of different tastes/cravings to choose from. Atmosphere is nice and the prices were very good. Pancakes were delicious, pretty big and fluffy. Everything tested fresh, and the home fries are different from most places, also they give you a small section of fruit with most meals which is great. Service was very good and our server came by quite often to check if everything was good. Food came out pretty quickly. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "The food and service is quick. Don't worry about the line up, it's fast and worth it. Here is pic of my Cowboy ( western). Sandwich. Good job Panagio's!\n",
      "Awesome place for brunch! I came here with a group of friends since we wanted a change from the usual, Cora's, and this place definitely met expectations. I was craving something sweet this day, so I ordered the peanut butter banana waffle with whipped cream (because what new year's resolution...? lol). Great combination of soft and crunchy, and it even came with a bit of fruit on the side (would have loved to have more fruit, but whatever). My friends were more on the savoury side with eggs and toast and bacon. One of them forgot to order her bacon well done, but the waitress was super sweet and friendly and offered to take it back to crisp it some more. Nothing fancy in terms of food, but definitely satisfying overall. When I arrived, there was no line which was perfect for us! But the line grew quickly - so when the other reviewers warn about lines and waiting, they know what they're talking about. Can't wait to come back for more!\n",
      "This is my family's go to place for breakfast. Their menu is extensive. They have the classics, as well as chicken and waffles and breakfast poutine. My favorite is the chicken and waffles. The big breakfast is massive and gives you the most bang for your buck. Pulled pork poutine was ok. Big portions, good prices, all your breakfast faves in one place makes this my number one family breakfast place. Get there early because the line is sometimes out the door!\n",
      "We were visiting Mississauga and Toronto from Florida, US and decided to check this place out for brunch. I tried their Rueben sandwich with onion rings and they were both delicious. My 4-year old son loves his waffles with scrambled eggs and I could tell he really enjoyed his meal. Turkey bacon strips were to die for. We will surely stop by here next time we are in Mississauga.\n",
      "Great service, my breakfast is always hot fresh and amazing. I love the environment, able to relax and have a good brunch with friends ! Btw the Chef is amazing, gave me my tea for free.\n",
      "My husband and I went and almost all tables were full on weekend morning we walked in got Sat ordered a few minutes later and got our food within 5-10 minutes. Food was hot fresh and yummy and waitress came a few times to check on us. Will definitely be back!\n",
      "I came here after work for a late breakfast. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon french toast. I've always considered french toast a fullproof meal but I was clearly wrong. My french toast was thick which I love but it seemed like it was very lightly dipped in the eggs bacause the middle tasted like regular toast not like bread that soaked up the eggs, milk and cinnamon. Also, I was very disappointed in the apple cinnamon topping. They didn't peel the apple before cooking them down. Anyone who bakes or cooks would sum that up to laziness. When you cook apples they become melt in your mouth soft but the skin remains chewy. You would never want the eat an apple pie with those contrasting textures. Overall my meal was meh but the servers were friendly and the restaurant was bright, open and clean. I'm sure other items on the menu are much better. I also liked the fact that they offer turkey bacon and coconut water in the coconut. I can't say for sure if I would go back to try it.\n",
      "My new favorite breakfast spot in North Mississauga. Why? - Service is friendly and while there are line-ups, they move quickly - The menu is great. Lots of variety and healthy choices (if you want) - The food is great and not just piled on a plate (nicely arranged) - The Home Fries are really good! - They don't put those little plastic containers of jam directly on the food (hate that!) - They'll give you a booth, even for 2 people, if it's available (no, \"sorry, that is for 4 people\") - The prices are reasonable for the service and quality - The hot chocolate is awesome! - The hours are easy to remember 7am to 4pm, 7 days a week. Easy peasy! So refreshing to see a clean, diner style environment with friendly staff that isn't as \"country\" as Cora's or as plain as Sunset Grill. You'll pay a couple of dollars more than those other breakfast spots, but it's worth it. And if you do luck out for a booth, you'll be very comfortable. Finally, go when it's not busy if you're trying it for the first time. Then you'll know that it's worth the wait when it is busy.\n",
      "Very friendly staff which makes the place feel like such a cozy place to grab breakfast. I love their chocolate chip pancakes!\n",
      "Your typical breakfast/lunch diner. It's a step up from Denny's, but nothing special. Unfortunately, there aren't many good breakfast places around this area.\n",
      "As soon as we walked in, we knew that its going to be a long wait as there was a line up but it moved quite fast. The food is great, taste is nice and the portions are healthy and tummy filling. Their menu is decent and attractive. We ordered their 3 egg breakfast which comes with toast and potatoes. I went with make your own omelettes which also comes with toast and potatoes. I got them to put in mozzarella, onions and green peppers. The breakfast was quite nice. The service is good and the server comes back to see if everything is good. The price point for the quantity and quality is decent as you come out satisfied. The restaurant is not to big and has plenty of seating but does get busy on weekends. There is plenty of parking.\n",
      "I wish it didn't take so long for us to get service. Honestly other than that I really dig the environment and food (the food was fantastic). I ordered the bacon waffle and black coffee, both fantastic (and finished it!) but the waitress took another tables order that sat after us before ours. I'll perhaps try it again.\n",
      "I had the $4.99 breakfast special which is only served Monday to Friday before 11AM. You get 3 eggs, one choice of meat (ham, bacon, or sausage), homefries, 4 half slices of toast (white, whole wheat, or rye), and a little bit of fruit. I also added 2 pancakes for $3.49 and a bottomless coffee for $2.49. The toast is buttered as usual. But I was impressed with their complimentary assortment of individually packaged spreads. I recall seeing: peanut butter, orange marmalade, strawberry and raspberry and blueberry jams. My scrambled eggs were off-timed and arrived a little cold. The sausages weren't dripping in grease. They were pretty thick and had great texture. I'm not a huge fanatic of pancakes but they were nice and fluffy. My favourite part of the breakfast were those homefries. Oh man, I was still thinking about them on the drive from work. The homefries had a thin yet crispy exterior surrounding each piece. They barely had any trace of excess oil and were dusted with some red seasoning to give them a bit of flavour. However, I could taste that the large pieces were not as thoroughly cooked and tender as the medium and small pieces. But I was given so much potatoes in a wide assortment of sizes that I could work around it. I was so stuffed that I didn't even think about lunch. The food was good. The service was pleasant and attentive with our refills although there were just 4 people at 7:30am. I think that Panagio's is a nice addition to the plaza it's in and I'll definitely be back!\n",
      "Very disappointed!!! Is this a franchise? Food is salty and the eggs they use are very small. I find it expensive as well. Close to $20 with my 15% tip for 2 tiny eggs potatoes and corn beef and of course coffee. I will not recommend this place....other places are more reasonable. Waitress is very nice and quick in her service (only thing I like).\n",
      "I went to Panagios with 4 friends on a Saturday morning for Breakfast/Brunch. It was very busy but we were able to get a spot before they filled up. It is very bright and welcoming, with fun decor painted onto the walls, and they have a very wide array of breakfast options to choose from. They were even able to accommodate my friend who is gluten-free, lactose intolerant, and allergic to eggs! I had the breakfast poutine, which was very good, and my other friends enjoyed the Oreo pancakes and bacon waffle. They both got rave reviews and if I went back I would probably try the Oreo pancakes as they looked really good. The service was a little slow, but that was expected for a busy Saturday morning at a breakfast spot, so we were alright with it. Our server was very nice and friendly. I will likely return to Panagios to try other things on the menu :).\n",
      "A group of friends and I stopped by this place on our way out of the city for a road trip. There was not much of a wait, although we had made reservations just to be safe. Although the service was a little slow, the food was worth the wait. They were very attentive. I definitely would like to go back.\n",
      "Busy restaurant for breakfast so get ready to line up. Great interior decor. Very modern. Awesome food!\n",
      "This place has a comfortable atmosphere, and their Oreo pancakes are a must. I'm pretty sure I didn't even stop to breathe while eating them. Great seasoning on the home fries as well! Highly recommend this spot.\n",
      "Decided to give the new Panagio's in Mississauga a try for breakfast/brunch. Was surprised of the decade since most of the breakfast places in Mississauga, look like the typical greasy spoon. Nice wooden tables with booths. Got there just around 11am and only had one couple in line ahead of us. There does not seem to be a hostess and it seems that the servers do their own seating. Was surprised when we were seated ahead of the couple that was in front of us. We ordered the diced corned beef with homefries with the two eggs, eggs with toast and fresh fruit, kids pancakes with a side of bacon. All meals were very good. The corned beef was a different approach to the typical corned beef. It is a large meal so watch out on ordering sides.\n",
      "Panagios to me is better than your average breakfast dine-inn spot! I have tried quite a few things on the menu and this includes lunch and dessert options. Portions are very generous and food is really good! Just a bit pricey but you will leave satisfied! Service is really good here as well!\n",
      "3.5 star? Come on, Yelpers, how can we be friends? Admittedly, it took me a while to venture to Panagio's but it's mostly because I thought that it's a greasy spoon type of joint. Not so. I've been there twice now and I'll definitely keep coming back. Best part: it's closer to my house than Sunny Morning, which so far has been my favourite breakfast/brunch spot in Mississauga. The space is kinda cool, with plenty of tables and a nice decor. Service is super nice and quick. I tried the Greek and spinach and feta omelettes, breakfast burrito and Pete's panini. Everything was really tasty and not at all greasy. Their home fries are yummy! The portions are generous and the food is reasonably priced. I really hope that you can look past the 3.5 star and give it a try!\n",
      "Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing because my experience does not jibe with the other glowing reviews. I ordered the California chicken clubhouse (no mozzarella) with onion rings. The onion rings were your standard frozen onion rings. Nothing to get excited about. Even the clubhouse wasn't as great as the description sounded. I mean, guacamole, yay! But there was hardly any guac on my sandwich and it was pretty flavourless. My dining companion ordered the eggs benny and he suspected the Hollandaise was from a mix and he was therefore not impressed.\n",
      "This place is amazing. I stumbled upon this gem of a breakfast establishment one morning while searching for something other then your generic Cora type place. Everything I've ever eaten here has been fabulous. The staff is just as wonderful, they always have great recommendations. Eggs benny with pulled pork... genius! porker burrito mouth wateringly great. I haven't been to another breakfast place since finding panagios. It's totally worth the wait!! Mississauga needed a place like this and panagios filled the void!\n",
      "Not sure what the craze is about this place. Would rather go to any other breakfast place. Too much time was placed on the seemingly witty pop culture nicknames on the menu and not enough time teaching service and crafting a good menu. Guacamole advertised but came as a paste, laughable that places still serve this! What was unfortunate is our server was training another server and not once was my water refilled or coffee. Only came to drop off the food and to bill. Place was almost empty except for two other tables. What a terrible place. Asked server for suggestions didn't really tell us anything to try. 'Everything's good'. Also the washroom smelled like death. Not a good thing to write about this place. Food was less than mediocre, poutine had potential but fell flat.\n",
      "We have never are inside yet. We usually get an omelette or something to brin home and share with the kids. Omelettes are berry good, will need to try other things on the menu in the future.\n",
      "Food is nicely presented, a nice smile from our server, fast service even thought it was busy, coffee was good,friendly place , I like it.\n",
      "Great place to meet up with friends over brunch. Lots of choice and delicious. Be warned that you may have to wait a bit but a line up also tells you that their food is great and worth trying. Food: Lots of variety. You're bound to find something you want. Our group ordered a variety of items from Big Breakfast to omelette, hash, grilled cheese and soup. See attached photo. Personally, I had the grilled cheese and it tasted great texture and taste. Atmosphere: Casual and friendly. Nice bright clean environment. They don't' rush you even if there is a line up.\n",
      "The wait when you arrive at Panagio's is a bit disorganized as they didn't have a hostess. Everyone would wait there between 5-15mins just to be approached and asked how many was in the party. The server that approached us (we had a party of 8) decided to give a table of 8 to the guests that were a party of 3 and was lined up 2 parties behind us. That was definitely a bad decision on her part. I questioned and another guest questioned why she did that and she stated that it might be crowded- yet she never asked if we'd mind. Either than this hick up, the food was great and the server who took care of our table was great when we finally got sat. We got the big breakfast, huevos of the ranch and the piggy smalls poutine. The big breakfast was typical, but their bacon was cooked perfectly. The huevos of the ranch wasn't what I had expected as I've had something similar in a few other establishments, but it was still yummy. As for the poutine, living in the states for more than a year and a half, I had to get one for breakfast and it was definitely satisfying!!!\n",
      "This is my new breakfast spot! This place definitely pays attention to detail. The spinach & feta omelette stood out to me. Even though the portion wasn't as big as other breakfast spots, the taste and quality was A+. The side potatoes are seasoned too & taste amazing. Try the Banana Foster French toast too, one of the best French toasts I've had in a long time! Only thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars is because we were rushed, so we didn't get to fully enjoy the food. Other places usually let you stay until you finish your meal, a couple of minutes after closing, but our waitress definitely did not, and kept on reminding us how many minutes we had\n",
      "I love coming to Panagio's for breakfast!! I'm glad to say I can sleep in on the weekends and still be able to come here in time (since they serve breakfast all day). It's also great because they are located in a great location with tons of parking space and only 10 minutes away from me. Their menu is refreshing as they have a variety of options to choose from. I like picking something new every visit. I always leave satisfied because they never skimp and always provide more than enough. My personal favorites are their: omelettes (you can customize your own) and their eggs Florentine. In terms of service, their servers are super friendly and helpful. The environment itself has a cool, modern feel to it. I would definitely recommend coming to this breakfast joint!\n",
      "The food was decent diner fare. The service was okay. Nothing spectacular. I might try them again sometime and update my review.\n",
      "Early bird special is a steal! A good all-day breakfast place, which I hope will last for years! (Also super selfish with this wish as it is only minutes from home.) ATMOSPHERE: Nice and casual. Suitable for family, young kids, or come with friends. Good sized dining room, with a mix of 4-person booths, and tables which can accommodate larger parties. SERVICE: Very friendly staff, although during busy breakfast hours they seem short-staffed sometimes. PRICE: Very good portions for appropriate prices. FOOD: They've got all the basics. And some nice twists. Not a \"WOW\" place - but pretty consistent, and hits the spot when craving breakfast foods. Again, good portions. Love the breakfast poutine - but often served beginning from lunch time on only. My family regularly comes here, and will continue to do so!\n",
      "The line-up is pretty long on the weekends if you get here during late morning. This is not a huge place but it's definitely nice inside; clean and modern. After the wait is over you are taken to your seat by one of their friendly staff and seated. Their service is great. If you come in a small or in a large group they are able to split your bill. The food is delicious. Their menu is extensive and it has everything you would want/need for a great brunch. They are accommodating to your diet as well in cases where you can't eat meat.\n",
      "All I can say is YUM! FINALLY a brunch joint in my neck of the woods! Our waitress was great! The food was awesome! I was definitely pleasantly surprised. You have to try the cluckin' good and the sausage is pretty good here too! The Nutella and strawberry waffles were amazing as well! Adding this place to our new go to brunch spots. Look out Bobby's, Panagio's is truly a gem!\n",
      "Good food! Good ambiance:) good service! Will have to try the pancakes next time..spent around $26 for two meals and a French vanilla)\n",
      "Flight was held up, so we all ended up exploring a bit. Stopped by this place which is in a plaza on the way to the mall. Quickly attended to by a very friendly waitress who explained the specials. Started with an amazing soup. Others got Omelette's, a Benedict of sorts, and simply eggs with bacon. Overall very good and worth trying, but relatively pricey I thought.\n",
      "I think I may have found my go-to breakfast/brunch joint. :) My boyfriend and I visited Panagio's for brunch on Saturday around noon. It was busy, and there was a bit of a wait, but it was more because the tables needed to be cleared and cleaned. In the meantime, we checked out the big take-out menu that was hanging on the wall. Panagio's offers everything from typical breakfast eats, including pancakes, waffles and sandwiches, to burritos, grilled cheese, poutines, burgers, soups and salads. It's better than your typical breakfast joint! Seeing as the menu was so extensive, once we were seated, we asked the server if she had any recommendations. She kindly offered a few suggestions, such as Panagio's Big Breakfast, Panagio's Western Holiday, Eggs Benny, the Mexican omelette, and the Oreo pancakes. We opted for the Big Breakfast -- we substituted the classic pancakes for Oreo pancakes (additional $2.50 I believe) -- as well as the 6 oz Steak & Eggs. We were hungry! :) My boyfriend also ordered Bottomless Coffee. True to its name, the Big Breakfast is indeed big. For $11.99, you get 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 links of sausages, 2 slices of ham, and 2 fluffy pancakes with a bit of fruits, a lot of homefries AND thick cut toast. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon strips were crispy, the sausages and ham were seasoned perfectly (not too salty, particularly the sausages), the fruits were fresh, and the bread was lightly toasted and buttered the way I like it. The BEST part about my breakfast was the Oreo pancakes...by far. The Oreo cookies add a nice crunch to the big fluffy buttermilk pancakes that were lightly dusted in icing sugar. I added some syrup and I spread peanut butter over them, and it was deeelicious! ;) As for the homefries, they were not as crispy and seasoned as I would like. The pieces were also not consistent in size, so they were not cooked evenly. The Steak & Eggs consisted of a 6 oz steak, 3 eggs with a bit of fruits, some homefries and thick cut toast. We asked for medium rare and it came out medium rare, juicy and tender all around. Our server popped by our table every now and then to make sure everything was good and my boyfriend's coffee cup was never empty. All in all, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our brunch at Panagio's, and we're looking forward to our next visit! The restaurant was bright and lively, the service was quick and friendly, the food was fresh and delicious, and the prices were reasonable, especially when compared to other breakfast joints such as Cora's and Bobby's Hideaway.\n",
      "Go here about once a month, set us is great and efficient. I've never seen the line be unmanageable, even at their peak times. Food is along the lines of other greasy spoons but with more lunch and waffle options. But I wish they had more healthy options than turkey bacon or salad. Love that you can do poached, fried or any style eggs with no issues. Family friendly with nice children liking servers! Inside def looks better than other breakfast joints with more than enough tvs set on channel 24! Portions are good and prices are even better!\n",
      "it was okay - the food was mediocre and the service was subpar - we literally had to ask for everything. from water to ketchup to refills.. it was actually quite annoying. I guess because it was kind of busy and they seemed short staffed; I felt we were getting rushed to pay our bill and leave. not my idea of a good brunch. I had the eggs Bennie with bacon, my friend had the Oreo pancakes, my bf had the Montreal meat Bennie and my other friend had the French toast. I found it ridiculous that substituting the home fries for veggies was an extra $1+ and that included sliced tomatoes... who pays that much for tomatoes?????\n",
      "Shopping centre diner. Ate a regular breakfast (eggs, meat, toast). Food and coffee is generic. Service person was very nice. TV sound is on. No music.\n",
      "It was a good meal. Coffee was great. Service was ok, too. It was a good experience for someone like me who'd prefer dimsum and rice over toast ,eggs, and homefries for breakfast.\n",
      "Had the California Club. Chicken was bland N needed seasoning. Had to add mustard to the sandwich which helped a little. The potatoes also needed something more to it. Coffee was weak. My friend had the pancakes which were heavy and under cooked. They promote their love for bacon and all things pork. But their Ham meh and the Bacon just ok. Nothing special. The service was great and price was decent. 3* Bc it was it's just middle of the line ... nothing to rave about.\n",
      "I really dislike the staff. They are not very accommodating and quite snobby. We walked in at 3:20 and they wouldn't seat us. They close at 4. There's was at least 5 tables occupied and they had lots of space but they made us do takeout (which they start at 3:30). But either way this was ridiculous because 40 mins is plenty of time to sit and eat and be done before 4 for two people.\n",
      "I have been here a few times- most recently on Mother's Day and even on a busy day the service was still quick and attentive. I love their pancakes because not only are they fluffy and large but cooked perfect on the inside which I find is a miss with a lot of breakfast places. Their side of home fries, sausage and crispy bacon are great additions to traditional breakfast goers! I've had their Mexican omelette and it was so yummy! The ingredients tastes fresh, eggs cooked perfectly and the salsa verde was the perfect kick. I highly suggest coming here for some great breakfast options ;)\n",
      "So this is a sort of unusual Yelp review, given that we didn't actually end up eating at Nadia's. Here's why: 1. The food was pricey. And I am a person who can be willing to spend on occasion, but for Madison, this place was a little too expensive for its location and food. 2. The main reason we didn't eat there. There was nobody in the restaurant. I mean NOBODY. No host, no customers, nobody. And yes, it was open for business (according to the unlocked doors and times posted). 3. The kitchen looked disgusting and the fish tank (as noted earlier) could definitely use a good bath. Ironic, yeah. We strayed off to find some other food and settled for the close-by Porta Bella.\n",
      "I enjoy Nadia's but I can't really comment on the food. I've only been to the bar. Their drinks are on the expensive end for Madison but the martinis are EXCELLENT. The bartender knows what he's doing. I usually come here for a drink with a good friend and share a creme brulee. Their creme brulee is also delicious, but how crispy the top is is a bit of a hit or miss. I love the atmosphere at the bar because it's cozy and quiet and the waiters mostly leave you alone to enjoy your drink and dessert. It's a super enjoyable way to have a long conversation with a friend.\n",
      "Best restaurant in town, if you enjoy good food, good atmosphere and money is no object to you. Nadia's have a relatively large menu compare to other first class restaurant in town(around 10 appetizers and 15 entrees) and all of them are done superbly. Since it has an extensive menu, you can always find something you like depends on your mood. Sometimes I like red meat, sometimes I like seafood and sometimes I feel like having game and Nadia's is definitely the few places in madison that can satisfy my everchanging appetite. I have tried pretty much all items for the appetizers and they all taste very good. I would personally recommend the roasted chevre and the frog legs. For entree the seafood crepe is a long time champion for Nadia's and if you are in the mood for red meat and poultry, I would recommend the lamb and the duck.\n",
      "Ahh...Nadias...where to start... I'd love to write that I can overlook the grimy dining room and horrendous service because the food is so good. The truth is that the food is decent if pricey but not nearly good enough to make up for Nadia's many other shortcomings. I know this is a strong statement but it was the worst service I've EVER had in a restaurant at this price range. Yes, I mean that. A quick list of 'to dos' for Nadias: 1. Hire a service for that fish tank. Nothing is more gross than an algae -filled fish tank in a restaurant. 2. Replace the missing ceiling tiles and clean the chandeliers. 3. Install a new rug. 4. What is the deal with the circa 1994 TVs in the dining room? I felt like someone was flipping channels all evening. 5. Sashimi Tuna @ $32 should not be served well. And it was small. 6. You should not run out of your Prix Fix Chocolate souffle at 7:30 PM on a Wednesday night. Oh yea, and it shouldn't have the consistency of Jello pudding. 7. The alcohol prices are a bit high. $7 for a local brew is not ok. 8. Figure out your french onion soup - it should be a staple. Its WAY too sweet. I'll stop here. Nadias rests on their laurels and their State St location. I can not recommend. 2 stars only because I think there is potential in some of their dishes.\n",
      "This has always been our favorite restaurant for celebrations but we're going to have to rethink that. This is now the 3rd time we have had either bad service or less-than-excellent food. Nadias is not a cheap restaurant -- the two of us each had one cocktail, an appetizer and main course: $110 before tip. For that price I expect that my food will be top-notch and the service impeccable. First our foie gras went to another table and sat there for quite a while before the waiter realized it had gone to the wrong table. By the time it got to our table it was stone-cold. We ended up sending it back to get heated back up. Then, no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one. Then my salad had the wrong dressing on it -- had to send that back. On top of this we witnessed multiple f***-ups so bad that I over heard the owner/chef griping at the wait staff -- and later, the sous chef had to go to the wait staff area/garde manger kitchen to get them to pick up their dishes that had been sitting on the line. Nadias used to have an edge but it seems to have dulled with time!\n",
      "The thing about Nadias is that it DOES remind me of a restaurant that you'd find in the Quartier Latin or in St. Germain du Pres, where ambience is not in their top list, but top notch food is. And that's exactly what you'll get here. The decor is pathetic. Sorry, but they can afford to renovate the place. But their food is delish, their staff is INCREDIBLY attentive, and for some stroke of luck, everytime I go there for my birthday, the owner's best friend also is there in the next table, he orders a full flourless chocolate cake for him and his wife, not eating it all, and sees me and remembers that it's also my birthday, and orders me a cake and champagne too. Ok, that's neither here nor there, but it's pretty cool that that happens. NO, I WILL NOT tell you when my birthday is... Hmph.. . You think I'm gonna divulge my secret?!??!?! *(hmphy, I wonder if that's already in the yelp info about me... Damn it!)\n",
      "My wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit... We had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out.\n",
      "Another of my top five favorite Madison restaurants. A great mix of French and Mediterranean cuisine. You never know who you are going to run into here....last time I sat next to Lieutenant Governor Barbara Lawton and the controversial Nino Amato also frequents the place. The owner, Abdul, is Moroccan and quite the character! Fantastic wine list and you can't beat the atmosphere. Second floor, right on State street, this place is a favorite for the classy in Madison to take in the Halloween party without actually partaking. The calamari is fantastic, as well as the duck in a plum sauce. I've never heard of something that wasn't superb. Just be prepared to pay.....entrees are $36-40 and I've never seen a couple eat here for less than $100 (with wine). Don't miss the cookie cup dessert...it's a masterpiece!!! 5 stars!!\n",
      "i had heard that this was an excellent place for a fabulous meal. great meal? check. excellent venue? ummm ... i think i was initially just weirded out by their large fish aquarium up front. it cast a weird 1980s miami vice blue glow out into what could be transformed into a really upscale room. the lighting needs work. but the waitstaff is helpful. it's pretty expensive - they've got prices i'd justify if they could get the atmosphere right.\n"

      "We went to Nadia's for some kind of special occasion about 5 years ago. I dont remember anything being particularly dirty, like a previous reviewer said. I do remember the huge fish tank., but not the TVs. The fish tank wasn't dirty when we were there, though we do agree it did give a Miami Vice kinda vibe, haha. The service was very good. The food was bland, other than salt , sugar, and butter. By this chriteria, I agree it was way overpriced. Exotic varieties of fish etc, but if you want monkfish, baked in butter, etc it's abailable fresh at seafood center, and very easy to cook at home. The walk up the stairway to enter was kinda weird, but overlookable. I enoyed the character of the old brick building.\n",
      "A Hole...yes. Cheap...yes. Fun...you bet! We went immediately following a meal at the Peppermill, otherwise I was planning on ordering a half-pound hot dog for a buck and a half...I was disheartened to learn that only a year ago, the half-pound dog was only 99 cents. How times have changed. Anyway, the table minimums are cheap, the drink service was pretty good...and it smells kinda like the way you want Vegas to smell. If you're into things smelling like soot. Which, apparently...I am. It was good, cheap fun...and it got me warmed up for the REAL money-losing I was to do later that day.\n",
      "This place used to be my favorite on the strip! We used to go for cheap drinks and foot-long $1.99 hotdogs. And now its been replaced by Nathans unimpressive dogs :/ They swapped out a lot of slots for Arcade games, which is decent, but I'm just generally disappointed in the changes.\n",
      "Slots A Fun is a small place where you can get drunk fast and eat for waaaay cheap. $3.99 for a a soda, bag of chips, and a 1/2 lb hot dog! can't beat that kinda deal. Since its a small place, the drink hostesses cover the slot and table game area in a short time so, you are able to sit a gamble and get comp drinks really quickly.\n",
      "This place smells like dirty feet. The people hanging out in here look like they have dirty feet. Ghetto as fuck!!!! Avoid like the plague.\n",
      "Cute little gambling area. Kind of dirty, but what else can you expect from a tiny \"casino\".\n",
      "My wife and I visited this casino upon the advice of our parents who used to frequent this spot in the past. I'm not sure much has changed here since that time (70-80's). Lots of slot machines (as the name implies) and no tables (at least none attended) that I noticed. I have heard that there is better payout on these machines opposed to the larger names on the strip, but I did not experience that :-). My wife and I visited this joint in the afternoon. We went to cash out our tickets and there was a sign at the cashier station that said \"closed - go to Circus Circus\". Nice! I think that might be a ploy to just have you stay put and spend the meager winning (if any) there.\n",
      "I always know I'm in Vegas when I come here and spend 20 bucks on a subway 5 dollar footlong lmao! Seriously how is it even legal for subway to rip you off like that haha. Slots of fun is like a 20 ton boulder going down hill....once it gets going...unstoppable. I don't even gamble here. When I stay at riviera I usually just come over to slots of fun to grab a nathans hot dog or some Over priced subway sandwiches. That being said there is something I like about the place. Just really old school vegas. Vegas actually needs more places like this. Hate to say it but I will be back lol\n",
      "First, let me say that this place used to be the bomb. Dirty folks that are so ugly and cracked out that you feel like you were the starting quarterback in the Superbowl, even after you just dump $3k at the Wynn. This is the place to come when you feel like taking over a shitty $.25 craps table and making stupid bets on snake-eyes, while pissing of the shitty dealers. Since Circus Circus bought this place, its gone downhill. Probably still worth 10 minutes of your time though.\n",
      "The finest casino in Las Vegas. Burn your Mamma Mia tickets and spend the night playing vingt-et-un with Prez, you white devil. He didn't lose those teeth by NOT having fun.\n",
      "ive been to vegas many times with my family as an underage kid who sat in the backseat of the rental car, looking out of the window at the flashy casino signs, gimmicky decorations and oversized replications of worldly places-- i cant help but to remember one thing-- the giant sign above slots a fun, advertising a giant hot dog :] so last year i finally turned twenty one, with a goal in my mind-- im going to get a giant hot dog. sure i gambled, drank alcohol like there was no such thing as a hang over, but i also found my way walking down las vegas blvd in freezing cold weather (it was january) without a jacket, just to get the frankfurter of my dreams. after two hours of walking from mandalay bay to slots a fun, i thought for sure we were going to give up or else there was a good possibility we might turn into the donner party and eat each other, but we made it with all of our limbs intact :] we ordered our dogs, sat at the counter and ate them in silence amidst the loud casino, feeling fat and accomplished all at the same time. i even bought a hot dog for my little yorkie waiting for us back at the hotel-- but sadly, i dropped it on the ramp going to caesar's palace. it was a sad, sad night. but honestly, my puppy wasnt missing anything. the hot dogs werent that huge, but maybe thats because im used to my dodger dogs back home :]\n",
      "They took out the table games and like half the machines to make room for pool tables and beer pong. And guess what? No on was playing. It used to be a fun place to play compared to the stuffy mega casios now its boring.\n",
      "This place is a real dump but I love it! You can't have every Vegas experience be 1st class; sometimes you have to get down and dirty with the locals and some low rollers. The drinks are cheap I think u get 2 pitchers of beer for $10 (beer pong)\n",
      "Slots-A-Fun has very strange odor. A mixture of cigarettes, hot dogs, pizza, B.O., and industial strength cleaner (the kind they use in the \"adult\" bookstores). I took a couple friends through here on the obligatory ten minute tour. Enough time to buy a couple beers, lose $3 in a slot machine (at least I got a quarter back!!! A real quarter-not a coupon-the only reason this place gets 2 stars!) and cruise by the $1 roulette table. I was hoping to teach my table game-wary friend how to play a simple game of roulette, but the proliferation of Lil' John and Ludacris wannabes hovering nearby scared her away. YEEEEAAAAH! Oh well- I never do well at those low limit tables anyway. I played craps here once and dealers were extemely rude. I wonder why this place, and circus circus,still exist when everything else nearby has been imploded.\n",
      "Yes this place is small, with the stench of stale beer and the sights of old people and crackheads, its a wonder this place has been here for so long. What attracts me to this place is their .99 cent jumbo hot dog. Uhm yea it's pretty huge. Great place to also people watch. The gaming is fairly inexpensive. But it's not like getting points for the Wynn for your player's club card. I can't give it a bunch of stars. Because based on how I'm rating things. It's the nostalgia which is great - yet downfall. In reality I'd give it 3.5 stars - There's nothing but you can really do here other than gaming - people watching, and eating big hot dogs...\n",
      "My family and I came over to this casino for one reason: a foot long (1/2 pound) hot dog for 99 cents. We had seen a show on the Food Network about hot dogs and this place was one of the cheap ones. So, we tried it and didn't think much of it; it tasted like a big roll of bologna. I guess if you are a huge bologna fan, you'll really enjoy it. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to go gaga for.\n",
      "I remember this place from like 10 years ago. It was so much fun to be walking north on the strip just past the Stardust(*sigh*) and be able to walk a few feet from the sidewalk of the strip and start playing some blackjack at a table! Those were the days! Slots A Fun is basically a part of the Circus Circus property. It is a seperate building off of that main casino and just off Las Vegas Blvd. From what I've been able to ascertain, it opened sometime around 1971. It is a small, unassuming space. You will find a fair amount of slots, some old school arcade games, and a deli that offers some great deal on snacks! The table games were taken out sometime around 2010-2011 ish. That is a shame, too. That was one of the best features of this place was to have table games within a few feet of the sidewalk. I've only been in a few times in the last few years, but every time I go it's a ghost town. There is just no energy to an empty building. I honestly think if they just spruced up the space a little bit and brought back the table games, than they would see a lot more foot traffic here. I hope this actually is something they consider one day. Until than, it is just a lonely and depressing space...which is a damn shame... 2 stars.\n",
      "You just cant help but pop in when youre in front of this place. Its just plain ol fun ready to hit you in the face! Cozied up to the bar next to Subway and played some video poker and enjoyed a dark Dos XXs. The machine was acting up so the barkeep hustled somebody over to fix it and I was in business trying to make my fortune again! I played on 20 for a good hour and had a good time. This is just a small place for slots and cheap beers or those tall ass margaritas in plastic half yards! Spend some time, get a buzz and move on!\n",
      "The giant hotdogs are gone. I repeat, the giant hotdogs are gone!!!! Why has my God forsaken me?! Oh, but they have specialized tables that let you play beer pong, so they got that going for them....\n",
      "I considered myself a vegas native at one time...we have not set foot in a casino since 08. Mom and I used to have a blast at slots. Always would rub the winners pictures for luck - that's ALL gone!!! First off Circus Circus is a total indoor swap meet with all these random stores with rude ass employees that are as ghetto as the crap they sell - vape stores selling beginners kits for $60!!!?!?! Bathrooms stank! And I watched 3 nasty asses walk out without even looking at the sink! It was crowded with families which is a given but a fair number of trannies too which you would expect in Hollywood NOT a kid themed joint. Now back to slots , I remember walking towards the doors and getting handed a coupon book with various coupons for little things like coffee and key chains - well not anymore. As you walk in you are thrown into shock over how empty and sad the place is. No waitresses no card games and more than half the machines are missing. It's disconcerting too see miles of gaudy empty carpet. I felt sad. When we walked to the front to check out the strip it was dark and quiet like being in a black hole especially with the huge dark empty spot next door. It's glory days were gone a long time ago but it was fun still. Someone need to tell slots that's it's dead and bury it already. Boo\n",
      "ok, let's all agree, the place is a dive, it's a favourite hangout for vagrants at 2am, and you don't want to touch the food or drink. BUT - $2 dollar craps, and $1 blackjack (was $3 at the table though) allows me to play aggressively at craps and blackjack when the rest of the strip is at $10 min bets on all games, with rare $5 min blackjack tables. The dealers were friendly and fun, the crowd obviously less well heeled but more aggressive and fun than higher end strip casino's. I played craps and blackjack with a starting stake of $200, and after four hours I was down $10... thanks to the low min bets. You can afford to press odds on craps and play properly without a stake in the thousands of dollars.\n",
      "Next door and now part of Circus Circus. It is cheap and old-school Vegas. They have upgraded their slot machines, so it has the newer multi-line penny machines. Didn't see any old coin type machines. You can use your Circus Players Club card in Slots A Fun machines. I'm mostly a fan because of the inexpensive food and drinks here. There are 3 food places ... Snack Nook which is famous for their cheap foot long hot dog (as of 01/23/11 it is $1.99 or $3.99 combo with bag of chips and a drink), Subway, (with their usual menu), and Noble Roman's Pizza (with 7\" personal pizzas, lasagna, bread sticks, and a 14\" pizza). The Snack Nook has other food items besides the hot dog. Nice little inexpensive gift shop with the usual souvenirs and miniature bottles of alcohol.\n",
      "I honestly feel the Circus Circus execs aka MGM Mirage, purposely sabotaged this place for reasons unknown. This place was semi well known for its always packed sidewalk craps table-gone, cheap blackjack and other table games-gone, funbooks which for years were passed out at the Circus Circus exit that included cheap drinks etc-gone, the giant Slots a Fun hot dogs featured on tv shows-replaced with chain restaurant dog, they used to give out free little sandwiches and donuts to gamblers in morning/afternoon-long gone, actual coin taking slot machines including the rare dime version video poker-gone. What you had was a casino that filled a cool little niche, cheap drinks, old school machines that frankly can be fun to play as a novelty or just because, great table game atmosphere honestly possibly the funnest in Vegas and just a great little place to spend a few hours- LONG GONE. Replaced by generic slots that can be found in any casino anywhere, crappy chain food and no vibe or reason to be there. Memo to whoever runs the Circus Circus unless you're intentionally running your budget casinos into the ground in order to justify closing them and building another monstrosity like City Center you are failing miserabley at what isn't a complicated job. Please understand part of Vegas is fun little \"dumpy\" places and you took one of the last if not the last one away for no reason I can decifer. No way this spot makes more now with its generic setup than its old form.\n",
      "If you want cheap gaming this is the spot, $5 blackjack, video poker, big hot dogs, lots of slots, I love the big one outside someone always win a few bucks, but skip the margaritas they really don't put much liquor in them. Its older and a little far down the strip, but you can beat the cheap gaming, also I love the fact the the machines pay coins win you hit nothing beats the sound of all those coins dropping cha ching! cha ching! cha ching!\n",
      "I am going to keep this one short and simple. Six beers for $15 on the Strip. Good luck finding a better deal. Plus a juke box playing some great Oldies and Classic Rock. It may be dirty, old, and smoky but Slots of Fun is a nice place to chill for a bit.\n",
      "Ok spot for cheap gambling and a better place to wait for the bus! There is also a little convenience store area to the side with high prices that match others on the strip.\n",
      "Review #200!!! Go once before they blow it up. Make it quick. I had a blast here one night with a friend. We were a bit intoxicated and playing that \"wedges ledges\" game. Do you know what I am talking about? The game where you try to get the coins to drop off of the end and into your bucket. Anyway, it was the most entertaining loss of $12 I have ever enjoyed. This used to be where all the dead heads would hang out when shows were in town. The bartenders still talk about it, and were playing some Jerry Garcia tunes while I was there. Don't eat anything here and wash your hands when you leave.\n",
      "Ok, let's make it clear. It isn't $1 for beer and footlongs anymore (as of 1/04/10). it's: - $2 beers - $2 footlongs not that it makes a big difference! The prices changed most likely, as others pointed out, because slots-a-fun is now part of Circus Circus next door. You can actually use Circus Circus' free play money at Slots-a-fun. The hotdogs were pretty gross, but hey they were practically free. Better than the other options in the casino: overpriced subway and pizza. The beer was good, the wait was short and the place had excellent atmosphere. Great place to drink on the cheap as waitress came as soon as we sat by the penny machines. I wasn't disappointed. Great place to hang out on the cheap for a couple hours.\n",
      "Oh. My. God. $1 Black Jack still exists? Ha-ha. My girlfriend and I found this spot walking from Circus Circus to who knows where. But... we are always down for an adventure. It was 98 degrees outside, and since we didn't know where we were walking to--the air conditioning that rushed out of this place lured us in. Once inside, I started noticing $5 black jack tables.... and $1.50 roulette video tables... and $1 black jack? Oh MY--WHERE WERE WE? The place was not the cleanest, but who cares when you are playing $1 Black Jack and being served free booze. This place is worth the stop. Don't let the homeless people out front scare you-- go in--throw down $10--and have an hour of fun-- well worth the experience.\n",
      "When you walk into a place and even the air feels dirty something is amiss. It's all electronic games. No tables with real people dealing. We went out of our way to check it out and were vary disappointed. Not worth the walk from anywhere.\n",
      "Im not ashamed to say it....I love this place. Yeah its a dive , everything around it is seeing the wrecking ball, BUT it's cheap booze,cheap gambling,cheap food and cheap women. $2 beers on the STRIP, a cab line next door so no wait to get away, Circus Circus has cheap rooms for when you need to pass out.\n",
      "Love this place for what it is..Seedy yes, Cheap..Yes but its the low end of vegas . seen a young kid win 5k here..\n",
      "This place is sketch as hell and I love it! Slots o fun is the best place for gambling on the strip! Theye have really chaep blackjack ($2-3$) and the slots are pretty loose. It's more than possible to spend an hour here on 20 bucks. Be advised it's not for the faint of heart. There is quite a crowd here ranging from the few 20 something college kids who heard of this place from their parents to the an older crowd in town for conventions to dirties. Beer is really cheap, always a loud good time. Recommended if you're on a budget or just think $20 black hands are silly.\n",
      "Who needs a dealer that speaks English when everything is so cheap? This place can be a blast if you go with a big enough group.\n",
      "Nice place to eat on the cheap. You'll get full or drunk off of what they have to offer for sure. I believe they still provide free donuts and coffee for gamers in the early mornings. This place is really old but why not try your luck?\n",
      "was super fun, wayyy to busy!!! And no payouts....blahhhh\n",
      "Unfortunately, I've never been at Slots A Fun in its previous incarnation. Other reviews will tell you, it was and appeared to be the anti-establishment casino. The defiant dive in the face of the ever growing mega casinos being built around it. This year, I was going to Vegas for the first time. I've heard Slots A Fun had changed, I've heard its absurd footlong meat-like product had been replaced with simply an elongated Nathan's. I was still going to check it out, and I held out hope that the massive baloney tube was still there. I couldn't imagine, after expecting the things it didn't have, that it was worse than I could hope for. It is simply just a smoking room with slot machines. That's it. With no doors or areas to shield you from the crippling dry heat in early August, it wasn't even a safe haven from the outside world on the strip. As Krusty the Clown had suggested about his fast food restaurant on an unmanned oil rig, \"Ah, close the damn thing down.\"\n",
      "Slots A Fun brings back a lot of great memories for me. Unfortunately, this place has been ignored and is no longer the fun place it once was. Perhaps someone will step in and save the place, but I fear it's days are numbered. We visited last weekend and there were 10 or 15 people wandering around. I felt sorry for the poor DJ they hired for some reason to play to an empty casino. DJ, Bowling, Beer Pong, Pool Tables, it all seems so random. I have an idea, bring back live Blackjack dealers, a roulette wheel, maybe a craps table and put it right out front where it used to be. Bring back slot machines to fill in the emptiness of the place. Am I asking too much?\n",
      "I like hanging out at Slots A Fun for all the blemishes that make other people hate it. Slots A Fun is the Hills Have Eyes of Vegas casinos. I literally saw a man covered in third degree burns, wearing a dirty trench coat, with what had to be a prostitute on his arm. Gigantic pigeons crowd the entrance pick pocketing drunks and waiting for tourists to drop food. The 99 cent hotdog is edible but couldn't possibly be \"food\". The texture and taste was like a hotdog shaped sponge that had been floating around in hotdog water. My friend did not carry the 99 cent hotdog to full term and performed the big spit into a trashcan. Beer costs something ridiculously cheap like $1.50. This is trailer park gambling and it is entertaining as hell. Go for the cheap gambling, cheap beer and the free freak show. I've been three times, on three visits, and will eventually go back for a fourth.\n",
      "Yes, they do have $1 craps. The problem is, if you've ever played craps, you can't make proper odds on a one dollar bet, so they are really just taking advantage. The crowd here is a sad and drained one, and I would recommend staying clear. Yes, the drinks and gambling are cheap, but you can find a good deal further up the strip with a much better vibe. Stay away from slots of fun.\n",
      "Well apparently the good folks that run this place listened to my last review. Are you ready for this????? They have woke up and smelled the 21st Century..no more coins out of the machines. They actually have *gasp* TICKETS now!!! And the place no longer smells like vomit. Nice job to the sirs and madams that run Slots a Fun!\n",
      "This place is freakin gross, and I love it. You can gamble and get drunk for absolutely no money. I feel like ever since Circus Circus bought it, it's not as busy or fun anymore, though. Last time I was there was May 2010. Before that, July 2008. Much better in '08.\n",
      "Had to Valet @ CIRCUS CIRCUS ... umm well, not many new machines, you can def say this is a hole in the wall casino. You will find great deals on alchohol and snacks/hot dogs etc if thats your stee-lo.\n",
      "Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy.\n",
      "Do not play any roullete, they dont haver a number board and even the dealer does not know what the last 2-3 numbers where\n",
      "Slots A Fun use to hold a dear spot in my heart up until the Rivera was torn down 2016. I met my girlfriend there on a blind date through a close friend of mine. We would hangout there occasionally for a hour or two on a Friday, Saturday. Beers were two for 5 imports $7 including tips to take care of our bartender. We would play beer pong, pool, a few slot machines, video poker. Listen to some classic rock while having a ball. I was in Slots A Fun earlier this year and the same beer imports we use to get are now $14. For what? The only reason why we went there was for the beer specials. It's not looking to good only a few people last time I was inside. After we bought our LAST round we just turned around and walked out. Don't plan on going back. That side of the strip is just to depressing. I wish Circus Circus all of the luck to keep open. Goodbye old buddy Vegas greed got you now.\n",
      "This is the smokiest casino I've ever seen. It's poorly ventilated. The air didn't seem to be working either. I visited around 7 pm and it was still unbearable. I played on machine while there and there was a sign on the machine saying you get no players points for playing on that craps machine.\n",
      "I thought this place was deserted because we were here at 3am, but having passed by it several different times throughout the day, it seems that it's just always empty. Surprising, considering its reputation as the go-to place for cheapo gambling on the Strip. Perhaps this was because all the table games are now automated (from what I hear, there WERE live dealers here at one point), and the Blackjack/Poker tables are manned by an array of creepy pre-taped video dealerettes. Or maybe it's because the cocktails are watered down even by \"free drinks at a cheap casino\" standards. Still, aside from the emptiness (and a couple of scary hobos continuously declaring their love for anal intercourse), this is an all-right spot to spend minimal money in maximum time. The $1 Blackjack table kept me entertained for a good while, and I only ended up $5 in the hole. I would probably prefer to stay closer to civilization at Casino Royale if I want to gamble on the cheap, but if you are staying on the north end, this place is still worth a visit.\n",
      "In the old days, I came here after my money ran low to kill time before the night clubs opened. It was truly a sight to be seen. There were plenty of tables, numerous bottled beers, and slots abound. It was a good place to cut your teeth the tables without spending too much money. The dealers would chat you up and teach you about the game. The dollar hot dogs were big enough to share with a friend or two. The customer service was excellent while the drinks were stiff. ALL OF THAT IS GONE!! This casino advertises dollar black jack, craps, and roulette. However, in actuality there are no live tables at all. It is all video. The place is run down and smells like crap. The dollar hot dogs have been replaced. There is an over priced Subway inside. There really is no customer service to be had because it seems like no one works there anymore. There is security and maybe one server. The place was full of people that I would cross the street to avoid.\n",
      "What a dive ! We stumbled upon this place walking out of Circus Circus around 6 am the morning after eloping at the Bellagio fountains. We had partied all night and it was getting bright out and time to head back towards our hotel. This place was a worn out, tacky, run down, almost depressing if you were there to seriously try to gamble. I didn't realize it was separate from Circus Circus. Now there were slot machines ( very old ones ) but it hardly could be called \"Slots o fun\" more like \"Slots o gloom\" or \"Slots here won't be won\" No one looked happy. The food selection was grim. We were wasted and happy ( see pics ) so we had a some fun for the short time we were there. On our last trip, I wound up there again by mistake. I went out of Circus Circus ( ya I know - but we stay in 5 star resorts so we like to slum it on occasion ) for some fresh air, and here it was - SOF. I just had to check to see if it was as bad as I remembered- and it was actually worse! It was dead empty. I am the only one there. The carpets stuck to my flip flops and it reeked of stale smoke ( yuck ) I sat at a machine to kill a few minuets, and some sketchy guy comes in and slides up rite beside me asks if the seats taken.... I say go ahead - mistake! He must of been some low level pimp. He tries to pick me up and thankfully my husband shows up right at that time and we leave. Bye bye SOF I won't be back !\n",
      "What happened to the famous 1.00 Hot Dog! Now they have 2 for 5 bucks, what a dissapointment. Once again something great is changed for the Almighty dollar. Greed\n",
      "Its nearly a dump, but ooh what a fun dump it is, cheapo gambling, cheapo drinks and all around cheapo fun.\n",
      "Meh...... Yea just meh it's on the strip in an area which is kinda dwindling away of all the glitz and glitter which Vegas has to offer, worth a quick walk thru if your @ circus circus and heading back down to the more lively parts of the strip. Has a couple tables which are never accompanied by an employee, some slots, and a few vending type gambling games, $1 blackjack machines, video table games... not really exciting or worth spending a lengthy amount of time with all the other great places on the strip. I wouldn't go outta my way to visit. Saw a little snack bar with cheap eats, sodas, beers....\n",
      "Ok so this is as low budget as one can get on the Las Vegas Strip (sorry Casino Royale). Great food deals (two Nathan's hot dogs for 3.50 I think) , cheap booze and low limit table games. Plus 24 hour Beer Pong. If you need to get away from the luxury of the Venetian, or you are feeling just a bit too clean at Wynn, stop by and slum it. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!\n",
      "We like this joint. We always hit it up after breakfast at the Peppermill (across the street). We are usually the only ones in there then so of course the cocktail service is phenomenal. It keeps us feeding dollar bills in the craps slot machine and horse race machine. Not thrilled that they got rid of the low limit craps and blackjack tables - but hey, the joint's name is \"slots\" of fun. The place is a little older and is far from fancy. The bar offers cheap food and drinks in the unlikely event that you don't score some competed booze. When you are all liquored up and come to realize you need to slow down, check out the gift shop. Grab a water and some cheap needless senseless souvenirs. You'll thank us later when you get home and open your luggage not remembering buying all that junk. Its like a surprise! Check us out on Facebook!\n",
      "Upgrades ruined this place. About 10 years ago I got my first taste of slots a fun. I loved it. One night, myself and my best friend were playing these two nickel machines in the back. We played for 12 hours then got our sorry butts on the bus and went back to the hotel at 5am. We loved those machines. It was one of the few places you actually put your nickel in. .50 roulette, you played for the love not to get rich. We ate at the subway in the middle of the night. Although overpriced it was good and surprisingly we didn't get sick!!! Now slots a fun has been killed by modern gambling. It's electronic now, no putting in your nickel and pulling the reel. The table games are closed. I did play some video roulette because we walked a good ways to get there and I wasn't going to make it a wasted trip. They should have just left it be. If I'm in the area I'll stop in. But back in the day we would go out of our way and travel down the strip to get there and play. It was our favorite spot. Now it's just a dumpy version of what modern casinos are. Boo.\n",
      "I absolutely love this seedy and cheap little appendage of Circus Circus. This is the first place I gambled once I hit 21 and it was a blast. Cheap tables, cheap slots, and surprisingly good drink service. Roulette was my favorite and I made about $30 bucks (not bad considering the $2 buy-in).\n",
      "Small place with cheap food and cheap drinks- so don't come here with high expectations. Known for footlong hot dogs. No frills ambiance. If you're on a budget, come here. Again, don't expect much.\n",
      "We only ventured here because we had a coupon for a free hot dog and beer. Disgusting doesn't even begin to describe the \"hot dog\". Utterly inedible. There are plenty of other bargain and cheap eats out there. Skip this one.\n",
      "Today as I walked in we were greatly disappointed that there is no more blackjack tables. It's the end of an era.\n",
      "I don't care what anybody says, this is where it's at. I won a good amount of money at the Wynn but I also dropped a lot of money at the Wynn. I came here one night, and didn't walk out profitable, but was able to play for 3 hours on my $20. That's all good to me.\n",
      "A broke college student's dream. seriously though $20 can go a long time here. 99 cent hot dogs, $1.25 miller lite, $2 henikens, $8 magaritas (the same yard cups that cost double at other places), $3 blackjack. Slots A Fun is the exact opposite of its glitzy Strip casinos. its small and grungy, and the crowd isn't exactly glamorous (almost creepy), but if you're looking for some cheap fun. you'll find it here.\n",
      "Is it a traditional \"5 star\" establishment? NO, but more people need to rate things relative to what they're trying to be! For what it is, this IS a 5 star place. Crazy-cheap and John Holmes-HUGE hot dogs that are decent, and low low minimum table games make this place IDEAL for someone young a easy-going or someone doing Vegas on a budget or just looking for a change of scenery from the flashy high-end casinos. If you're a crusty old lady used to cush cush service you get at the Bellagio, hell, don't come here, it's not for you. Again, for what it's trying to do, it's 5 stars.\n",
      "This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!\n",
      "Ok, well I didnt go here to play slots or cheap table games. I happened to be nearby and hungry. I started to recall the Yelp reviews about the cheap hot dogs that are available and figured, what the hell. So I go inside and there is the snack area that sells the hot dogs right next to the Subway. Huge line at Subway and nobody at the snack bar. I think \"Hmm, surely these people do not know about these glorious hot dogs. What a pity!\". Most likely they were looking at me and thinking, \"Look at that idiot standing alone at THAT place. Does he believe EVERYTHING he reads? What a pity!\". So I order the hot dog and make it the combo. It says you get a hot dog, a bag of chips, and a 20 oz soda for $3.99. I think thats what it cost at least. I'm trying to erase the whole episode from my mind so I may be off a little on the price. The soda you get is actually a lot larger than 20 oz though. Anyways, on to the hot dog. Why did I even take a bite of this mystery meat concoction? First off it was cold. I should of just threw it away and chalked it up to another Vegas gamble that didnt pay off. But no I'm too damn stubborn. Took a bite and almost vomited. Got up to throw it away. Even that was an ordeal. Having to maneuver through a maze of rats with wings...errr pigeons....must be part of the ambience that people seem to like about this place. I will be back to do some gambling I am sure. I WONT be back to do further damage to my intestines though.\n",
      "Slots Of Fun managed by Circus Circus just needs to rollover and die. This is not the Slots Of Fun of yesteryear. They took out all the live table games and dealers. There was not many slots like there used to be and they added pool tables. Who the hell goes to Vegas to play pool? I did not see a bartender nor a waitress but that's probably because I was in and out literally in under 60 seconds. I might check it out next time only because it seemed quiet and I hear they have $1 video blackjack based on prior reviews.\n",
      "I love slots o fun. I won 700 dollars with 10 bucks. Good times. Food is gross but no one bothers u there. Plenty of machines to choose from. Sure it's a dive but worth ur time and money. I will always go back and I go to Vegas once a year.\n",
      "What kind of mystery meat do they put in these wrinkly giant hot dogs? Actually, I don't want to know, but it filled me up for $2. And you (blackjack) people who constantly double down when the dealer is showing 10 and you have 10...I'm going to choke you.\n",
      "I love me some dives. This place is run down, falling apart, smells like an ashtray's armpit, and is otherwise a sign of the end times. But it has cheap drinks (they even have one of the giant take-home cups for $7), the funniest bartenders on the entire strip, and the biggest collection of freaks at the tables. It is just neat to be able to play and literally watch people walking by on the strip. If you want run-down w/ worse lighting and crappier service, you can go next door to circus circus or cross the street to riviera.\n",
      "I remember going to Westward Ho next door when they had the footlong hot dog, and it was great!! I still love the footlong hot dogs at Slots O Fun though!! Yes, they're not that great, but hey, where else can you get a dog that big for that price?? It's good, but not great. And yes, the prices seem to be always changing. It's not a buck anymore. I think when I was there last year, it was $2.49 or something like that. And the dog isn't quite as big anymore either. If you want a better dog, there are tons of places in Vegas, especially Downtown, that have better dogs. Not as big of course, but still pretty big and still fairly cheap.\n",
      "I ventured over here to kill some time, but the slots were really boring and I didn't win anything. Generally I'll win a few bucks, but here, the slots were really old.... you can tell they taped some of the missing bits together with Scotch tape. So lame. The machines also don't spin properly. However, you'll find the cheapie slots from 1 cent up which could be cool for some.\n",
      "The slots are ok. I used to frequent (from 2003-2009) because of the 50 cent chips on the roulette table. So I learned roulette at this casino. They have replaced the physical roulette table with a slot machine that only seats 4. BAD CHOICE!!!! I would suggest they had at least 4 more seats to this machine because that was about the amount of people the old physical tables could hold. It makes it hard to get on the machine because of the limited amount of space. All the table games have gone mechanical and exist as some slot or another. I think it's sad that its come to that. But they're trying to remain competitive. I think the servers/waittresses should be on the floor more, but maybe there are less of them too. Getting a drink took forever. Overall, I enjoyed gambling here. It was nostalgic but I idoubt I'd make the trek down the strip (going out of my way) again.\n",
      "Slots of fun has the reputation for being a fun place....it was not fun at all. $.99 hots dogs did not sit well in my stomach, the pina colada almost ended my life, and to top it off i lost money in the slots machine. Thanks for the fun...slots of fun\n",
      "This place has changed a lot since the last time I was here (about 8 years ago). It is a shell of what it use to be. I remember they use to have dollar foot long hot dogs and yard drinks for cheep but that is gone. Instead they have a subway there. I will say this place is really good for penny slots and has a wide variety of themes and types of machines.\n",
      "Visited again Feb 2014. They've actually put some effort in here. Looked cleaner, drink service was good, hot dogs were good (and cheap), some nice machines. They have pool tables (which I find odd in a casino...not a big money maker). An ok mix of gambling machines (smallest casino I've seen, some gas stations have more variety), I saw zero live tables, but to be fair to them, they seem to be making an effort compared to the disaster I saw a couple of years ago. Not at all crowded mid day Wednesday. Nice little store with good prices. Decent dining options, I like the roomy feel with the machines not jammed together. Amazingly I went from hating this place to considering it as an occasional diversion. 2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3.\n",
      "Slots a fun is a gambling hall dating back to what smaller LV gaming was like before in the 70s and 80s. Giving you a different feel, people came for the $1 hot dogs and you have a definitely younger feel at the casino here than the major ones on the strip. I remember coming here 15 years ago when I couldn't afford the $15 -$25 minimums of the main casinos for table games and you could enjoy blackjack or the other games for $2 a hand or $5 a hand. It would get rowdy here with the younger crowd and drink specials as the night went on! Now it's looking a little more tired as it ages and you wonder how much longer they can keep a go at it before the wrecking ball or dynamite blows the place up. The N end of the strip will be revitalized I. The next 10-20 years as the boom comes back and then the property here will be worth a lot. Till the it's an aging casino that has seen many a wild night and we shall see how long it lasts!\n",
      "Cheap gaming and cheap drinks make this an easy place to spend a few hours at the north end of the strip. It feels more like gambling for fun than gambling to win - though the slots here did pay out pretty regularly. The crowds around the tables were also big on enjoying themselves.\n",
      "Love the name, but the actual place...well, not as much. I don't know a whole lot about Vegas as I have only visited twice so far in my life. I do know this place dates back to the 70's and was kind of a big deal. They used to have cheap table games, $1 hotdogs, and was always busy. Now, there are no gaming tables, they still have hotdogs but they are no longer $1, and busy...if what I saw on the visit I made was any indication of the norm, then I would say not at all. Yes, they offer cheap beer and snacks comparatively as well as some cheap souvenirs in their shop, but this place looks dark, dingy, and very tired. I think I read \"seedy\" in another review and that fits as well. I will say the drink service here was good, but I can't say the same for the actual drink. The majority of the slots looked very old, but they were cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. Remember, if you have a players card from neighboring Circus Circus it will work in the machines here as well since CC owns this place. Slots A Fun does indeed have slots, but whether or not they are A fun is really relative. If I find my way to Circus Circus again I would stop by here for a few minutes, but I wouldn't go out of my way.\n",
      "I don't gamble with my money, only my liver. But I did put in a few dollars in the decrepit slots here while my husband enjoyed a 99 cent ginormous hot dog. Then we moved on the $1.25 margarita which was a bit on the sicky sweet side and a little too slushy, but still did the trick. The people watching cannot be beat and if I'm going to gamble, I'll do it here where the minimums are low. You won't find any high rollers here, but if you want $10 to last all afternoon, this is the place to go.\n",
      "I'll start by saying, I'm really surprised this place still exists. If I could I would give it zero stars. From someone who's seen this place thriving at its best in the '80s it hard to imagine this place is still operating in its current condition. This casino HAD it all, it had the excitement, cheap table games, free souvenirs, music, crowds, lots of slots, value and more value, etc...now the place is a neglected rundown ghost town with no table gaming, very few out-dated slots and a very quiet depressing atmosphere. My guess this place is still operating is, they don't want to give the adjacent Casino (Circus Circus) a bigger \"eye sore\" by closing it down prematurely before they continue to redeveloped that hurting north end of the strip. Sorry for the harsh review but, I'm sure I didn't point out anything that the operator/owners (MGM) don't already know. I doubt they even bother reading their reviews.\n",
      "1 star for the nasty 99 cent 1/2 pound hot dog that is uneatable even when starved. But 5 stars for having dime slot machines and video poker machines from 1983 and those old games where the quarters shoot out and try to push other quarters down to you. After everything, it's an average spot if your in the area to check out.\n",
      "Utter Disappointment! I really went to this place with the highest of hopes after reading some of the great yelp reviews. \"hills have eyes of casinos\" and \"burn victims\". I was so excited to see it. Unfortunately, there was nothing of the sort on the Saturday night I went. Osheas made Slots a fun look like the Wynn! I didn't even see one guy sucking down a cancer stick while wheeling his oxygen tank around. Also, there wasn't a game to be had for under $5. That is how it is every weekend. Contrary to how advertised, craps and blackjack are no less than $5 on weekends. I'm sticking to the western with $3 blackjack, \"free\" root beer floats and karaoke Saturdays. \"Tearidup!\"\n",
      "I dragged my party down to Slots-A-Fun because it was the last place that I knew on the strip that had coin operated machines. I miss that *ching*ching*ching* sound and a bucket full of nickels, unfortunately, it's gone from here too.\n",
      "this place is the opposite of the mega-resorts on the strip...it was actually a destination spot on my last trip to Las Vegas...i was remembering how great this place was 10 years ago....and when i returned this summer i was glad that it had not changed one bit.....cheap and potent drinks, fun gaming and the greatest 1/2 pound hot dog in the world.....a great little place with a funky, anything-can happen vibe...\n",
      "If you're looking for the cheap hot dog, apparently, they don't sell them anymore. There's just a Nathan's cart near the entrance that offers two piss ant hot dogs for five bucks. No reason to ever step foot in this place.\n",
      "i love this place!!! cheap tables. crazy crazy people watching! staff is great!!!! hot dog!!! with everything. get it!\n",
      "\"Hey bro, I just won a mini jackpot... let's get that giant hot dog!\" $2 footlong hot dog... you really can't go wrong with this. I didn't even play here though, so my review is limited to running in, and looking for the hot dog place. It is a nice little break from the McDonald's dollar menu!\n",
      "Cheap gambling, cheap table games...this is place you go to learn without busting a nut, i mean, busting your wallet while learning how to play... Not only that, but besides driving further down to downtown, this is place has the cheapest coronas and heinekens at $2 a pop, and cheap, and pretty decent food, for when your broke. They also have a Subway... Oh, and now they have this lounge act in the back, and oh my god... Think of its a section of the back part of the building, were they have a little stage, and they have this one man band guy singing... guy was pretty cool, and was all into his act... You need to check this out!!!\n",
      "If anyone reads my reviews then they know that I am a huge fan of good dive bars. While vacationing in Vegas this weekend one of our travel partners recomends Slots of fun. This place is right next to Circus Circus so it must be a dive bar. I walk in and feel the stickiness of the old and nasty carpets. The place smells of cigarretes and booze. I order a beer and a daqarui for my finace and the price is 4 bucks total!!! Jackpot! This place is the ultimate dive casino!! Lost among the giant ultra glam resorts you have this tiny casino that looks like some sort of reject bastard casino from Vegas's past. This spot seems to be popular spot once the party is over. Leaving Tryst or any other spot at 5am and they you just end up a slots o fun for some ultra cheap gambling and some cheaper booze.. 2 dollar black jack and 25 cent slot machine makes for some great fun when you are downing cheap booze. Like any dive establishment the crowd is a mixture of old people just passing time and the younger crowd who is simply looking for a pit stop after a hard nights partying... Thumbs up!\n",
      "LOVE this place! I'm glad that they kept this casino! Cheap blackjack for $1.00, Vegas Vacation was filmed here (when Rusty won the car), and home of the footlong hot dogs! A lsmall part of the \"old vegas\" before the strip became a tourist trap.\n",
      "This place has great pizza! Everything here is real good EXCEPT the customer service. The customer service was great before now it seems you're doing them a favor by ordering from them. They have become very rude, very impatient with customers. I only order delivery. I can\"t imagine if I walked into this place and ate there. Remember MARCO\"s we the customers make your business thrive. Find better employees or we will not eat here any longer.\n",
      "Horrible wings, no meat. Horrible pizza, overcooked and hardly any sauce. Wings are advertised as being super meaty. Not true.\n",
      "I got a coupon in the mail for a free medium signature pizza. This is a crafty marketing strategy. I got hooked. The free deal required me to buy something at regular price so I got the garlic cheese bread. This was a good choice. I walked in and waited about 10 minutes for my order. The pizza has a hand tossed crust. The prep area is in full view of the front counter, so I watched the talented pizza chef toss my crust and top it. The pizza was hot and cooked to perfection. The toppings were abundant and evenly distributed. There is a generous amount of sauce. I like a saucy pizza. The sauce has a sweetness which works well with the seasonings. There is not too much cheese but just enough to get the melted strings when you bite into it. This pizza scores a 4 out of 5 for crust texture and sauce, cheese, and topping ratio. The cheese bread was good, but chewy. It had a nice flavor and came with marinara and ranch dipping sauces. It was a good deal along with the medium pizza. for $5.00. I also got a customer appreciation card to be punched every time I buy a pizza. The 10th one is free. So with this kind of deal and good quality, I will be making several return trips to Marco's.\n",
      "One of the best in town by far! Love this little Pizza place. It's been a few pizza places over the years but I'm sure Marco's is here to stay! Great service and food! We will be back weekly for sure! Our new favorite spot for dinner on a budget and a rush! Welcome to the neighborhood!\n",
      "Ordered Marcos Pizza for the first time tonight. All three of us give it 5 stars! Love the thin crust pizza and all the toppings were plentiful. Daughter loved her thin crust white pizza and their cheesy garlic bread was amazing. Want to try their wings and sandwiches next. So excited to have our great new pizza place so close for easy delivery. Also, shout-out to Anne at Marcos for helping me through my order.\n",
      "Ate here today with my grandma for Mother's Day and we were I the very happy we did. Nate was super kind and welcomed us at the door. This pizza is fresh , generous cheese and we got the Italian sausage with onion and it was perfect! Took the leftovers home.\n",
      "Excellent food, and service! The wings are the bomb!! I'll be ordering again (Already have! :) )\n",
      "I wanted pizza tonight but didn't feel like driving to go get it. I checked yelp and saw all the great reviews and fast delivery. It was music to my ears. The pizza is REALLY good. Probably some of the best I've had in a while. The delivery was fast and my family and I are stuffing our faces as I write this. I'm definitely going again!\n",
      "Before we discovered Marco's, we thought we had to have the good pizza flown in from Oregon. We had tried multiple pizza places around the state looking for a great tasting pepperoni pizza. When we finally found Marco's we couldn't believe it; their specialty Pepperoni Magnifico is perfect with a great crust. We love how easy it is to order online, up to and including picking a delivery/pickup time! The rewards program is awesome and easy to use and everyone is very friendly. The single time (out of many) our order had a mix up, it was made right straightaway and without issues. We continue to be incredibly happy with Marco's!\n",
      "Customer Services is HORRIBLE! Placed an internet order.I arrived at the time promised in the email. The lady at the counter told me it was just coming out of the oven. In fact, it had not even been started yet. Meanwhile, walk in customers who arrived after me, were ordering at the counter and getting their orders before me. Try being HONEST and upfront with your customers, chances are , they will usually understand.\n",
      "I thought it was very good pizza, little taste of back in the Midwest. I got thin crust pizza with everything duo Us, I believe it's called. This time I will try the same type of pizza only with original crust. Little Bear is the best driver on the delivery front by the way\n",
      "I've ate here a few times and I've thought the pizza was pretty good. I had ordered those times just pepperoni and simple stuff like that. Tonight however was different. Laura looked on the menu and ordered a specialty half Uno Deluxe and half Chicken BBQ. I was starving and when I saw that pizza box open up I was not let down when I bit into that deluxe. At that moment I quite literally felt it was best piece of pizza I have had in years. The sausage was so good. I then continued eating and ate a piece of the chicken bar BBQ. I knew at that moment I would be writing a review later. High quality and great customer service. Thank you Caleb and team!\n",
      "Wow super cheesy pizza this place is awesome I'm never eating another pizza in my life!\n",
      "I thought the pizza was great! Nice flavor to the pizza and I loved the crust. Price is comparable to other delivery pizza places. I'm also really happy they deliver. I will definitely be ordering again.\n",
      "You know when there are awesome people doing an awesome thing and you want them to be successful? That's how I felt the first time I ventured in here. This place is the whole package. The guys here are nice people that you wouldn't mind having a drink with. The spirits are great tasting and not for the weak. I love the story behind how George started the Distillery as well. I've done the tour twice. I enjoyed it enough to bring back my brother and his friends when they were in town. The tour is about 45 minutes and ends with a tasting of any and all spirits that you desire. The passion that these guys have for their craft shines through in their tour and tastings. They have a shop as well so you can purchase anything you enjoyed enough to take home. My husband and I purchased the Nevada 150 Bourbon Whiskey when it was released and had the pleasure of meeting George. Seriously, he is such a kind, humble man. He made us feel more like we were joining the Las Vegas Distillery family than just purchasing a bottle of Bourbon. I love to see local businesses that love being part of the community and are giving it their all. The product and the people are top notch.\n",
      "L O V E D this place. The exterior is super-lowkey, you would barely notice it. Inside is adorable. Two GORGEOUS copper stills that shine with glory, and full production right inside the warehouse. We've done the entire Bourbon Trail plus some, and this was the most detailed tour we've taken. The dude (sorry I don't remember your name!) was incredibly knowledgeable, which makes sense because he runs it all himself 6-7 days/week. The tasting was ridiculously thorough. We tasted everything they make, some stuff that is discontinued and some stuff they mixed up just for fun. We are NOT vodka drinkers, but left with a bottle because it was so smooth. Best part is that you get to bring it back for a refill at a discounted price because you're re-using. Phenomenal. We'll be back to make our own bourbon :)\n",
      "Their liquor is fantastic! It has great taste and is very smooth. It's a little pricey but well worth it for the quality!\n",
      "A true gem in the dessert. Located in a small business park, from the outside you'd never know the inside holds the only artisan liqour distillery in Vegas. I attended the first official group tour of the distillery, as they just recently got government approval to give tastings on site as well as sell their product. I encourage you to take a tour to hear the amazing story of how the Racz family overcame the odds and started the first and only liquor distillery in the drinking capital of the world. As you can imagine the large liquor businesses, do not want local competition. Although founded in 2008, they first were not able to sell their product. But through friendships, networking and passion, George Racz and his wife have been able to pass legislation in Nevada that will open the doors for others to do the same. The owner George Racz and his family moved here from Transylvania and he'll joke that the reason they're not open in the evening because they are out sucking blood. During your free tour you are shown around by George himself. He will tell you his story as well as how all of the liquor is made. Buying their grains locally from Winnamucca Farms, they truly believe in Buying Locally, Drinking Locally.They make their spirits in small batches and bottle them by hand! You are able to taste any or all of their homemade products: from Whiskey, to Bourbon, to Vodka, to Moonshine, to Rum, to their own concoction - Rumskey (Rum and Whiskey mix). My all time favorite was Grandma's Apple Pie Moonshine - which isn't even available for purchase yet, as they'd been waiting on labeling approval. We were told 3 weeks and we should be able to pick up a bottle or 4 (yes it was that good!) They are also working on a recipe for Grandpa's Smoked Moonshine, I can't wait for that one too! You can now purchase bottles of your favorites in various sizes while on your tour, and they even have discounted prices for bottle refills - amazing concept! If you want a T-shirt, they have them there too, you'll love their logo. I love supporting local businesses, I truly hope they thrive here. Beginning October 5th they will be hosting classes on site: everything from making and barreling your own whiskey, to mixology lessons. I will definitely be signing up! Come out and visit (check out their website for tour dates and times), you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "I found out about this place by accident, and I'm really glad I did. I brought my boyfriend here as a surprise because he enjoys beer and spirits, but also a farm-to-table approach. I love that Las Vegas Distillery has a farm-to-bottle thing going on, where a majority of the grain used to produce the stuff is grown within the state. Sid was our tour guide and he's such a great guy. He was lively, knowledgeable about all the product, and you can tell he has a passion for what he's doing. He let us sample some of the things they were making and one of the things that won me over was the gin. I'm am NOT a gin drinker at all. But what they had was different, more floral and refreshing. He mentioned it would go well with a lemonade and I can't wait to buy a bottle and see how that works out. The tour shows how everything starts out and ends with them bottling some product. It also has some Nevada history, which is a plus. I would definitely go back again, it was a great experience.\n",
      "Incredibly impressive set up just outside of the main area of Las Vegas. The tours are an awesome way to get to know your whiskey better, but even if you can't do a tour just go check this place out! The people working are awesome, the whiskey is tasty, and there is a liquor store attached, what else could you want?... a couple breweries and a place to make your own wine you say? Well your in luck, this city block of booze paradise has all of the above!\n",
      "Just completed the tour of this distillery. What a wonderful informative experience. We met and were given the tour by George, the founder and owner. His story of this adventure is well worth hearing. Truly, the American Dream. What a wonderfully transparent honest man. the bourbon was to die for. His almost four year old bourbon was my favorite, however, I loved them all. This man is a true pioneer of this industry here in Nevada. When he explains his story of development, he is passionate and honest. It was a struggle. With the support of certain people, Crescent Hardy and Nevada Bank, he will succeed. Please enjoy this tour as my wife and I did. truly amazing. PS: My thoughts on Crescent Hard went up a couple of notches hearing of his support and input and assistance. Likewise our local Nevada Bank.\n",
      "LOCALS AND OUT OF TOWNERS: This is a \"must visit\" place. We're local Henderson residents and might not have toured the distillery had family not been in town. We were all so glad we did. What an amazing place. I love the décor. Sid was our tour guide (we didn't really get to meet George since he was doing the tasting from the tour before us) and he was absolutely terrific! He combined fun along with his incredible knowledge and his passion for being a part of the distillery. He made us feel quite comfortable and explained the entire process, not hesitating to ask the many questions we had. The tasting was lots of fun as well. He's quite entertaining and made the whole visit so very well worthwhile. We also purchased some of their gin (amazing citrusy taste; the Grandma's Apple Pie moonshine; and a bottle of the straight oak whiskey. For us, as local residents of Henderson (& Nevada) it was great to learn that 80% of the material they use is from our own state! We love supporting local businesses and will definitely continue to support this one. I SERIOSLY RECOMMEND A TOUR AND TASTING FOR LOCALS AND VISITORS!!!\n",
      "My wife and I visited the Las Vegas Distillery today and spent the better part of an hour tasting their fantastic offering. Everything they produce is absolutely top notch for being such a young distillery, but the real treat was getting to chat with Sid. We chatted about all the mash bills and differences in all the spirits and got into all the odd details we could ever know. Top notch customer service and product. Definitely going to stop by every time we're in Nevada.\n",
      "I came here on a group tour and I was incredibly impressed with the set up. I learned a lot from the owner George about the different spirits. Grandmas moonshine was a favorite in our group. The most amazing product in my opinion is the bourbon. Aged only a few years, it tasted better than some of the top shelf bourbons I have tried. If you follow them on social media, you will see the sales and information about the new products.\n",
      "On Friday and Saturday nights, a bar emerges to let loose this tasty, smooth nectar. With most of the Las Vegas food and drink writers/bloggers focused on the Strip, and the extreme Westside of town, The Las Vegas Distillery is truly one of a kind in the city and shouldn't be missed. Where else can locals taste, locally made Rum, ten plus different styles of Whiskey, Vodkas, Moonshine, and Rumskey. A Rum/Whiskey hybrid that goes great with Coca-Cola. I've never been on the LV Distillery tours, but they look awesome. You'll get a brief tour of the property with multiple booze tastings and some great distillery history. I usually come here and enjoy the tasting room for a bit grab a bottle that fits my mood that day. I really love the 12 Grain whiskey; it has great flavor and none of that crazy afterburn. Their vodka is a staple in my freezer, it goes great with soda water and a lime, a great way to unwind at the end of the day. Most recently they opened a bar on Friday and Saturday nights that offers most of their booze options for tastings and housemade craft cocktails. It's super low key, educational and the if you're lucky you'll get to taste from some liquor straight out of the still like I did. Whoa mama, it was strong, like 120proof strong. My chest was lit up! The Las Vegas Distillery is one of many reasons to come down to the Booze District. But if you're looking for somewhere to start, this place is clutch.\n",
      "took the tour today. absolutely fantastic. Sid was great and knowledgable. Been to Vegas many times. highly recommended.\n",
      "Nice little find in Henderson. I checked out a tour and tasting with a few friends and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The employee giving us the tour was very knowledgeable and had an answer for every question. He took us through the distillation process and let us taste the product in various stages of production. After the tour we were able to try any of the spirits, plus there was an awesome bartender making cocktails. He made some delicious drink with with cucumber and their gin which was so refreshing! All their products were pretty decent (apple pie and the gin were my favorites), but as a grad student I can't exactly afford a bottle. However, it is a craft distillery so I do understand the higher prices. This is the first and only distillery in Nevada and they're staying local by sourcing 80% of their ingredients from Nevada. So if you're all about buying local, check this place out!\n",
      "I like to support local businesses, especially ones that make whiskey. It's located at the \"Booze District\" where the local breweries and wineries are expanding. The tours are very informative. The best part was being able to try the whiskeys, vodkas, and moonshine that they make. I am a fan of the Nevada Whiskey, but my favorite is Grandma's Apple Pie Moonshine. It's a little bit on the strong side, with a hint of sweetness to it. If you have friends from out of town that want to venture off the strip, this is a great place to go.\n",
      "This review has dates back to 2012 just before the distillery opened. I had THE BEST customer service experience of my entire life. I popped into the distillery in November to pick up some Christmas gifts for my one and only. He likes Gin! I had found out all I needed to know on the website so I drove and drove and drove as far away as I could possibly drive to get to the distillery. Just kidding! But it is a hike from Summerlin. So me, my mom and my sweet baby in his stroller entered the elusive distillery. George was warm and inviting and promptly welcomed us and gave us the tour. I told him I was ready to buy a bottle of moonshine and a bottle of gin. Alas, sadly, he could not sell them to me for 6 more days until he got his liquor license. Noooo! Waaaa! I was so sad. No worries, says George. I'll bring them to you next week. Write down what you want, and your address, and I'll deliver them. What?!?! Am I hearing things? You are going to deliver a measly 2 bottle to my doorstep during the week of your opening. He said yep...and you can pay me then. Sure enough...6 days later, George calls and says he is on his way. He hand delivers my two bottles. I felt like a real prohibition rule breaker. Got me some bottles of liquor in a brown paper bag in my driveway and slipped George the cash. George wished me well and gave me a big distillery style hug and went on his way. I repeat, I have never experienced such fantastic customer service in my life! What an establishment! Hubby loves his goods. He says the gin has a menthol or minty flavor to it; different from your average gin. He gladly shares his moonshine with visitors but insists they swig it out of the mason jar. If you haven't been, go. It is such a cool addition to Vegas. A great spot for gifts! We also scored super sweet distillery t-shirts for husband and dad. The distillery is cool. During my visit, the staff was sitting as the stainless tables, hand labeling and writing on the bottles. Pretty cool. See for yourself!\n",
      "Saturday we ( Barb, Linda, Martin and myself ) spent the morning at Las Vegas Distillery. The owner George and his staff gave us a tour of the facility and explained how they make Whiskey, Gin, Vodka, Rum and Moonshine. George is an immigrant and his story about his journey of starting his Distillery is inspiring. Costco just picked up his Moonshine, which is like hitting the lottery. If you have the time and enjoy liquor make plans to stop by the Distillery for a tour and tasting. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "If you're a whisky fan, this isn't the place for you (or vodka & gin for that matter). Went here for a tour, while it was fun and entertaining to learn how they distill here, their product is something I cannot endorse. We tasted a few cocktails made with their spirits, and then tasted all of their vodkas. I had to spit all of them out. Everything tasted like bottom shelf cheap liquor...and begging for a stomach ache or a nasty hangover. I will stick to Hendrick's and Speyside Whisky. I trust the people that have been doing it for many years.\n",
      "Fun tour. I learned a lot. Sid spent a lot of time with us. I found some great and unique liquors. I wish them great success.\n",
      "great selection of spirits. moonshine, whiskey, rum, gin, and a few mixed ones i dont remember. great prices! i think they said that either total wine or lee's liquor carries their products.\n",
      "This place is a great local find! The owner is so passionate about his craft, you can feel it in the way he talks\n",
      "Really enjoyed the tour and tasting. Knowledgeable guide, pleasant and patient. Nice way to spend a couple of hours on a hot summer afternoon. Make sure you try the Mom's Reserve Apple Pie Moonshine.\n",
      "We had such an amazing time. George is extremely knowledgeable about all the workings of a Distillery. The tasting and tour experience is a must when visiting. Do not leave with out buying a bottle of the Moonshine Apple Pie, it is the BEST!!!\n",
      "Great crew, fun tour and tasting. Would definitely go back again. Try the apple pie moonshine!\n",
      "We had so much fun tasting all the wonderful vodka, gin, whiskey, rum and moonshine (hope I didn't forget any). Sid was incredibly knowledgeable about all their products and made the experience fun! Love, love, loved the LV Distillery Nevada Gin and brought some home. I'll be back for sure! Great find, this place, I'll be passing the word on to all my friends. :o)\n",
      "Awesome place and very off the beaten path attraction. George (the owner) is worth the trip and price of admission. Really cool story, and of course get to try some tasty whiskey... Very much recommended.\n",
      "This is my favorite place in town! The hospitality in unrivaled. Local business and support local industires!\n",
      "Wonderful place to learn about how the whiskey can be appreciated and enjoyed... keep up the good and work and provide great service to our locals and tourists alike...\n",
      "Great group of guys at the Las Vegas Distillery. W food a guided tour and he was very friendly and informative. Even if you don't know anything about the distilling process you will leave understanding the basics! Great history on the laws and process they've been through since opening! Good luck guys!!\n",
      "Need some education with your booze? Of course you do! We had a great time learning from George and hearing the great story of how he went from sailing on the Danube to opening up the first distillery in Nevada. He is charming, smart and entertaining not to mention very hospitable. He actually came in special after the 4th of July conduct our tour. There was a huge selection of gin, whiskeys, vodkas and moonshines for our tastings. George was happy to let us try them all although we wisely stopped at around 6. We took home some apple pie moonshine (also available at local Costcos), wheat whiskey, 7 grain whiskey and a bottle gin. I am completely in love with their gin. George uses prickly pear as part of his botanical mix, and it gives the gin a lovely flavor. We hope to come back for the release of the single malt whiskey this winter. Without a doubt, we'll be coming here to stock up any time we come to Vegas.\n",
      "Best distillery I've visited. Owner is wonderful and humble and the product is amazing. Do yourself a favor and visit this place. It's wonderful.\n",
      "The first distillery in Las Vegas! I popped in here with some friends while distillery/brewery-hopping in the Booze District, and had a quick look around the place. We didn't have enough time to dedicate towards doing a tour but it's something I definitely want to come back for at some point. They do tours a few times a day and they also host events on a regular basis. Aside from distilling a variety of whiskey/bourbons, they also are known for producing Grandma's Apple Pie moonshine. It is made with Martinelli's apple juice and has the spices you would get from an apple pie. Very tasty if you dig moonshine, which is gradually becoming more and more popular. Fun fact: For those of you who are familiar with the process of distilling alcohol, a percentage of the volume evaporates during the aging process. This part is called the \"angel's share\" and due to Vegas' sunny, dry, weather, the angel's share is 5x more than Scotland or Kentucky's. The alcohols aged here have about a 10% angel's share each year. This can be troublesome, because of course, this means there's less whisky to sell! However, due to barrels' porous nature, it also does the whisky a favor by interacting with the environment. Somehow, this distillery has made it work to their favor. Will be back! Also note: Las Vegas Distillery can be found at Total Wine.\n",
      "Amazing place! Tour was cool, alcohol was great and the staff was beyond amazing! Sid was awesome, can't say enough good stuff about him! Came out for a joint bachelor party activity and had a great time! Thanks Sid!\n",
      "Super place. We got the tour while visiting Las Vegas and it was as entertaining as educational. The Grandma's Moonshine is delicious but watch out, it is also strong. We have tasted lots of spirits and it was truly a great place to see.\n",
      "Im loving the Moonshine!! Great options and this tour is very interesting. Whiskey down to the science.\n",
      "If you are a fan of distilled spirits, you absolutely must visit Nevada's first craft distillery. While visiting, I met the guy in charge of bottling, and the owner, George. Both were very friendly, an obviously enjoy what they are doing. Seriously, this place is worth visiting just to see the still, which is a piece of art. George told us that they just got into a couple of Costcos, so I expect that we'll be seeing a lot more of Las Vegas Distillery -- and that's a good thing. These are people you cheer for, and genuinely hope will succeed.\n",
      "Sooo Cool!!! Found this place after they were sampling product line at my local Smith's. Then they came HIGHLY recommended while at Total Wine & More. We decided to drive on over, really close actually. Just walked in and one of the guys welcomed us right away and said he'd be starting a tour in a few minutes, WOW. It ended up being a few of us and he walked us around the warehouse. What a cool operation they've got going on here and what a story!!! We just restocked our liquor shelf and bought all \"non mainstream\" stuff. We have these guys' Vodka/Gin/Gma's apple pie. Very cool and the first \"legal\" distillery in Nevada. Keep up the good work! Ignore the 2 star review. Obviously that person doesn't appreciate the hard work that is going into this small business. Don't get me wrong, Hendricks Gin is amazeballs but the Gin from Las Vegas Distillery has it own special flavor just as does Hendricks... don't hate on a place just because your taste buds can't handle what real Vodka should taste like.\n",
      "I'm a whiskey drinker and bought a bottle at Lee's last time I was at my mom's in Henderson and got a token for a tour. The Whiskey was rot-gut. I went to the distillery anyway and they were nice guys so I bought a bottle of the Rumskey. I didn't taste it but my mom said it was terrible. The nice guy told me the whiskey was only \"aged\" 7 months. 7 months! Why bother putting it in barrels in the first place? You didn't improve the taste, only the color and you can take care of that with food-coloring. I'd give it a shot again but not for another couple years (years, guys, give it YEARS).\n",
      "George is really fun, and does a great tour and tasting. The spirits are amazing. We started at the Las Vegas Distillery as part of our exploration of the Booze District in Henderson. It is great to see and support a local business.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I went there and took the tour. We had a wonderful time, place was amazing, and staff was awesome!!! We are definitely going back for the distilling class and bringing all our friends. This gem of a place is a MUST do!!\n",
      "My first visit was for the re-opening after the Distillery closed for renovations. We got there just in time to join the first tour. The owner/distiller George is passionate about this place, and it's an informative tour. We enjoyed the samples, and all the liquor is for sale on-premise. They also sell shirts. This is a great place to bring visitors for a unique Vegas (actually Henderson) experience. They should name one of their liquors \"Hendertucky\" moonshine.\n",
      "OK I do not drink hard liquor, but this very cool place was on my latest tour with Las Vegas Beer tours, and I must say I enjoyed it very much. The owner is an awesome guy, and he gave us the grand tour. Several of the employees also greeted us, and talked to us about the product. They handle their own distribution, company right in house, and a liquor store which they own right next door. Wala their own 3 tier system, GENIUS!!! Very cool place, well worth a trip out!!!\n",
      "Holy amazing this is the best kept secret in the foodie world! I am reviewing this so that fellow elites join ranks and show Las Vegas Distillery some love! 1) George is awesome. He taught himself everything and is a self made man. 2) It is way cool inside here and one day he might teach some classes! 3) He is dedicated to using a lot of local Nevada ingredients. 4) Hello moonshine! 5) Shop Local people and keep the money in NV. With his dedication to artistic techniques there is no reason not to keep the money in town. 6) George is really cool and plays chess. 7) He did a homeschool field trip and told the kids all about the process of making spirits. He let them look inside the pot stills, label their own empty bottles, and play with grain. Why are you still reading this? Head on over!\n",
      "George is so passionate about what he does and works very hard to make his products the best they can be. He shares the story about how he got where he is and you feel an instant connection. He explains the distilling process from start to finish and makes the entire tour an enjoyable experience. He takes the time to really get to know his visitors and you leave feeling just as much pride in his products as he does. This is a must-visit when you're in Las Vegas!\n",
      "It's refreshing to meet someone who is passionate and dedicated to his work ie the owner named George who gave us the tour. I came here with 5 friends and we learned a lot on this tour of the distilleration process. The story of how he and his family overcame the odds and ends of opening the first distillery in the \"drinking capital of the world\" was fascinating. After the tour comes the tastings..from homemade whiskeys, bourbon, vodka, rum and their all time clients favorite Grandma's apple pie. If you are a fan of distilled spirits then this is the place for you! I can't wait to come back for the Chocolate makery tour & tastings coming soon.\n",
      "Neat place! I've been on two tours now, and I learned something different each time. The tours are mainly the large distilling room. The best part is the tasting at the end! The guys are all very nice and knowledgable about what they are doing. The owner takes immense pride in his community support - he has a wall dedicated to it. Good tour - even better if your 21+\n",
      "My mother visited me a while back and we wanted to do things that we \"Vegas\" but didn't involve the strip or Fremont street. We were looking for wine tastings and we found something better, whiskey/vodka tasting! George is a hilarious and friendly man that will give you a tour of their facility and learn all about what is in different types of hard alcohol. He gives you some information about the history of Vegas and tells different stories that tie to his business. After the tour, we tried a variety of vodkas, whiskeys, and moonshines. I fell in love with Grandma's Apple Pie Moonshine and I will be going back for some more! Definitely go here!\n",
      "The tour and tasting is worth far more than they charge for. I went with a friend on a spur of the moment decision & we enjoyed it immensely. The staff is knowledgeable, very friendly and accommodating. The spirits are varied - there's something to meet everyone's tastes. There's no better reason to drink local.\n",
      "Ok, so I kinda missed the boat on updating this review. I'm here now so that'll have to work. In addition to Nevada Vodka, which is delicious, Las Vegas Distillery now also produces Gin, Rum, Whiskey, Moonshine, and Rumsky. My recommendation is you go down to the Half Full Store (right next to the distillery) and buy all of them right now. The quality of ingredients and the effort George puts into every single drop of his products is far and away the best I have ever seen. Forget the fact that he's such a great guy, he knows how to make spirits. I still highly recommend stopping by and getting a tour for yourself and I know you will be as excited as I am by the end of it. Think Local, Drink Local. Boom! Las Vegas Distillery is the first legal distillery in the state of Nevada. Although they have yet to ship their first order, they are currently open to the public. Stop in and get a great tour of the distillery from owner George Racz, complete with a story about his journey to open a craft distillery in Nevada. His excitement about his job is contagious and will make you look forward to the coming weeks when the first Nevada Vodka will hit shelves in the valley. Also, coming soon is a shop within the distillery where tastings will take place and bottles will be available for purchase. I will edit this review upon the release of the Nevada Vodka.\n",
      "George and the LV Distillery are a treasure! Got to take a distillery tour and not only is this the only local distillery, but everything is sourced locally as well. Something different to do with visitors. The tastings were wonderful, and the newly opened event space would be great for so many things...I'm actively looking for something to book in here. George is also starting classes, so if you want to distill your own keg of whiskey, this is the place to do it!\n",
      "Great! had a fundraiser event there- George is very accomodating. All products are of very good quality - being distilled on premises and very short transportation distance. Favorites: - moonshine. drink by the drop - the aromas expode, so a small bit..a VERY small taste is suggested. Try and shoot this? You better have grown up on \"mash\" before you attempt a whole swig. Would make a devastating jungle juice. - 7 grain vodka. clean, flavorful.\n",
      "Thank you Sid for being such a gracious host! Hearing the story about the owners journey to America and how the distillery came to be in Nevada was fun and inspiring. Being educated on the distilling process from ingredients and their scientific ratio to the Angels Share of evaporation plus being able to smell a new batch of apple pie moonshine. Enjoyed sampling the Rumskey and apple pie moonshine after the tour!\n",
      "This was my first distillery tour/tasting ever! If you haven't come here you, you should! I highly suggest this place for whisky, rum, and vodka. They also have moonshine! The distillery is located in a inconspicuous warehouse-esque plaza. Fun fact, this is a prime spot for brewery, wine making, and of course this distillery. We came for a tour and was greeted with top-notch friendliness and bottles of water. We waited for our whole tour group to arrive, and once they they did we got a very educational tour of their distillery. We learned plenty about how the distillery came to be in Nevada, as well as the process of how they make their goods! You get to see things up close, smell whats being made, and of course you get to have a tasting of their products. You are free to ask as much questions, and they are more than happy to share with you of what they know. Let me tell you, they really know their stuff! Of course my favorite thing during this experience was the tasting! We tasted everything. Some of my favorites were the Apple moonshine, their gin (tastes peppery), and straight kamut whisky. But I will say that everything they have here goes down smooth and delicious. If you have a particular flavor that you love, you do have the option to buy what you want to add to your cabinet at home. They have packages, or you can buy it by the bottle. They also have other miscellaneous goods like shirts too, to commemorate your visit. I left very happy with my experience and highly suggest doing a tour and tasting! I mean why not?\n",
      "Amazing time. The employees are knowledgeable and friendly. Do it, don't question it, just go, enjoy, and buy a bottle of something!!!\n",
      "Who knew there was a booze district in Henderson? Watch out Ireland and Tennessee. Las Vegas Distillery is about to put Nevada on the map! The Las Vegas Distillery is a one-of-a-kind spot in the desert. The setup is eye-catching from the column stills to the bar and gift shop. The owner, George, is an entertaining guy from Eastern Europe who will drop some serious liquor knowledge on you. Most impressive was his hard work and persistence to chase the American dream and build this distillery from the ground up. If you have some time, the $15 tour and tasting is worth it. Lasting about an hour, George took us through the process of making different types of distilled alcohols including vodka, gin, rum, and of course whisky. You get a chance to taste every type of alcohol produced on-site. Everyone had a great time and George made this one of the most memorable stops for my buddy on his bachelor party weekend.\n",
      "Bourbon day was awesome!!! Thanks Sid and George.... Cheers to many many more years and lots and lots of more barrels !!\n",
      "If I could give 6 stars I would. What an absolutely WONDERFUL experience! My girlfriend and I have always agreed experiences are worth far more than possessions. For my birthday, she signed me up for a 3-hour session at the Whiskey School here put on by George, the owner and founder of Las Vegas Distillery and the man who made America's first Desert Whiskey. George taught us everything from the history of the drink, to how it's made, grain to bottle, to how to use his million dollar contraption pictured behind us - not to mention each intricacy of the science in between. We were involved the whole time and it was more-so a conversation, not a lecture, which makes for a strong learning experience. In the middle of the session, he even bought us lunch! Another one of the employees there (I think Sid? Missed his name) joined us as we sat down at the picnic tables inside. Two pizzas were ordered and we shared a six-pack as we took a break from the whiskey talk and got to know each other more personally. We finished the day with a blind tasting where my newly gained knowledge resulted in one of 20 or so perfect scores George has ever seen. My girlfriend and I left with smiles ear to ear, two new bottles from George's first barrels, a new best friend and one unforgettable memory. What an incredible man and day well spent. It's worth mentioning that we were the only people there that day for Whiskey School, so others may have different experiences based on class size, but we were utterly wowed by how great of a day we had. We cannot wait until the next time we are in Vegas so we can stop by the distillery and catch up with George. Did you know, the whiskey that naturally evaporates from the barrel during the aging process is called Angel's Share? In Scotland and Kentucky, 2% of the barrel is consumed by the angels each year. In Las Vegas' dry climate, George copes with upwards of 11% loss each year. In turn, no whiskey can be aged in Las Vegas 10 years or you'd simply have nothing left. That 50 year old whiskey your friend gave you from Scotland? Unless it's air, your friend was lying. These are some of the few facts you'll learn and retain throughout the day. Lastly, it stuck with us how George mentioned coming to America with his wife from Romania was life-changing and becoming an American citizen is the highest honor. Couldn't help but be happy hearing that! One of the other reviews on here mentioned when there are awesome people doing an awesome thing and you want them to be successful. That's exactly how I feel as well. Cheers, George!\n",
      "I came here for a Yelp event but I would like to review the alcohol I tried while I was here. I think it is so cool that this is the first legal distillery here. During my visit here I was able to taste the rum and vodka the distillery offers. It was delicious! I am generally stuck on flavored alcohol but the drinks I had today were more than enough to surpass any other drink I could make myself! The rum and vodka is more than worth the money.\n",
      "We've been going here since they opened and each time we leave we plan our next return. It's like home, in a sense... Just great people, good times, and everyone sharing their passion for the art of ethanol.\n",
      "This is a pretty AWESOME place where you get to learn about the brewing process of hard liquor and you can get Nevada-made vodka! I visited this place during the last Yelp event and the staff was super friendly.... they even gave me some free samples. If you are fan of rum, vodka, gin or moonshine (you read correctly- moonshine), you can visit the distillery and actually bottle the booze yourself and take it with you! There are different size bottles you can choose from so you can take as much or a little liquor as your heart desires. This is one of those cool places you never thought could exist in Vegas.\n",
      "Forget Mike! I wanna be like George. George is the man behind the Las Vegas Distillery, and his passion, kindness and enthusiasm are matched only by the deliciousness of his Rumskey, a one-of-a-kind blend of whiskey and rum that this mastermind has created. However, they make it all: vodka, whiskey, gin. It is all quality from the taste to the beautifully labelled bottles. Honestly, it is hard for me to capture my enthusiasm for this endeavor with mere words. The authenticity of it is somehow bigger than the delicious byproduct, and every aspect reflects Vegas at its best, but that's another essay. In addition to being able to purchase their spirits around town (at Whole Foods for example), you can smell and see the entire process firsthand at the Distillery, plus, you get to meet George. He will immediately bring a smile to your face. To arrange a tour, just be sure to contact the Distillery ahead of time. Unfortunately, you currently can't do a tasting at the Distillery, but it is still worth experiencing this angel of the valley. P.S. Legend has it that if you ring the angel bell, it will bring you good luck in the casinos.\n",
      "Was at the opening party the other week...what a great event. Had the Rumskey and Moonshine and... Even the extra staff for the event were knowledgeable. The band was great mixing up great tunes. The distillery will be a good asset to the local area.\n",
      "Loved the tour and George was a great guy and very helpful. This is definitely a hidden gem.\n",
      "Now this is a must see for any Vegas trip! An exciting young distillery, with several creative offerings. This is clearly a group who enjoy their craft. If you are looking for a same same beverage this is not the place for you, I recommend you stick to the larger brand names. However if you know the pleasure of experiencing a creatively produced drink by someone who truly has a passion for the craft then this is a great spot. Personally I am a fan of wheat heavy whiskey so I was a fan of the whiskey as well as their new bourbon and pleasantly surprised by the Nevada Vodka, as well as the Nevada Gin. Don't tell my whiskey but the Gin was good enough to enjoy a glass on the rocks with a shot of lime. And don't forget a slice of Grandma's Apple Pie for desert, well done guys!!! This was my most enjoyable day in Vegas, given how many new things they are trying I can't wait to check in on my next trip to Vegas, beats pulling handles any day!!!\n",
      "We recently held our team event of 40 people at Las Vegas Distillery. George, Sid and the whole Distillery team did a fantastic job of providing a unique environment to host our event. Everyone enjoyed themselves tremendously with the tour and tasting. We would absolutely recommend the Distillery to anyone who is interested.\n",
      "On a while my husband and I decided to drop by and do a tasting and look around. so glad we did! The owner is ne of the most friendly people you will ever meet and he had tons of information. I learned so much about whiskey, who knew there was so much to learn! This is one of our new spots that we will be bringing our out of town guests, and making sure all our local friends visit.\n",
      "I brought my boyfriend to the Distillery knowing what a whiskey guy he is. An Experience of a lifetime. What a wonderful gift George and Sid ( The owners) are giving to Las Vegas. The Distillery is something everyone should experience. Starts with a great story on how George and his wife came to America and started the distillery from nothing but memories of when George's grandfather use to distill. A heart touching story of hard work, passion and continued perseverance. As a small business owner myself, George's story helps me to understand that I am not alone and that with the same amount of hard work and passion that I can be successful like the Las Vegas Distillery. Learning about the process for making the gin, vodka, whiskey, bourbon and rum was amazing!! The tasting was amazing and being a whiskey drinker I truly was overwhelmed with the love and care they put into each batch. My boyfriend ( the whiskey guy) actually loved the gin more!! We brought home bottles and t-shirts and we have told several people who live here in Alaska that it is a must see and do when they visit. Thank you again George and Sid for an amazing time and adventure. Keep up the hard work!!\n",
      "Off the beaten path and worth every mile. You will have a tasting, but you can drive home... worries be assuaged! I learned so much about the process of distilling and loved the fact that the tour appeals to all your senses. Taste, touch, smell, sight and sound, the whole process is brought out in front of you to experience first hand. I feel like I learned so much about the process of distillation that I have a new appreciation for the art and craftsmanship of spirits making. I would highly recommend seeing the truly unique \"copper angels,\" I've never seen something so fascinating to watch and understand how gin, vodka, whiskey, moonshine, are organic arts directly from Nevada. Honestly, I felt like I may have a had a quiz at the end because I was learning so much, and hanging on every phase of the process. If you don't see it, you'll wish you did when you start seeing the bottles at Whole Foods and upscale \"speakeasy\" bars.\n",
      "I had several solar companies come by and give me a quote, Radiant gave me a great price but I was shocked after hearing some install horror stories how smooth everything went. Solar was definitely a great fit for my family and our electric bill. A+\n",
      "Radiant Solar absolutely BLEW ME AWAY. They started with an online consultation and explained literally EVERYTHING I needed to know about going solar. And not just that, they also asked me questions and got to know my situation very well. Then we had an in-home quote where they told me exactly what they recommend. Their price was extremely reasonable and the solar energy generated each month is exactly what they told me it would be! The panels look amazing and overall it is a GREAT ROI. Radiant Solar is the best in the business and I recommend them to ANYONE who wants to save the earth and save some money in the process. A+ rating\n",
      "Was blown away by the courtesy and level of service from Kevin, Jack and their team. They worked with me to find the best overall solution for my needs and I continue to tell everyone about them and Radiant Solar Solutions!\n",
      "Do you like receiving illegal robocalls on your cell phone that is registered on the Do-Not-Call registry? Me neither. But I was getting weekly robocalls about \"saving money on my electric bill\" and no matter how many times I tell them I'm not interested, take me off your list, I don't qualify, etc, I still keep getting the calls. So I decide to set up an appointment to see who the hell is bombarding me with these robocalls and who shows up? These guys do! If you are looking for solar, I would suggest going with a company that respects your not wanting to be bombarded with cold-calls and actually abides by the TCPA, not these guys.\n",
      "I have been studying German in different schools in the last years and IFA is definitely the best one I've found!! Pro's: + friendly, young, dynamic environment. + great learning methods: in the lesson there is a bit of grammar, a bit of conversation, a bit of listening... in other words a byte of stuff. + actually I like the games that Rennie25 hates: they are made to keep you awake and to practice your pronounce. + great book: clear, concise and with a lot of nice pictures :-) Con's: - sometimes the classes are too big, up to 20 persons - depending on the teacher that you get, the lessons could be awfully boring or quite interesting...but that's life!\n",
      "I am not so impressed with ifa as aygul. I have never been to another language school in Stuttgart, but ifa is not a particularly motivating place. Teachers are often grumpy. Technology is very low about 1980s..no language lab, not much in supporting audio material or that type of thing, i have never even seen a pc there. Teachers like to play childish games in class that kill time as well. The school seems proud of the historic location, but actually it is a construction pit of renovation. It is rather noisy and unpleasant, but it is a short walk from u bahn, so that is a good. I would give ifa a C grade. Nothing special. an intensive course is about 20 hours a week, any school should be able to teach something in that amount of time.\n",
      "It's really difficult to find in Stuttgart better place to learn German language than Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen (Institute of Foreign Cultural Relations): excellent teachers, flexible timetable, intensive, evening and weekend German courses from A1 (elementary level) to C1 (intermediate level)! Strongly recommended!\n",
      "I want to start by saying I am open to adjusting the review if IFA attempts to fix the situation. I would like to describe my experience here so anyone considering studying here can be aware. I signed up for a B2 Deutschkurs because my other school (AGI) was full. During the sign up process they told me that I would have to take a placement test. So I asked the secretary if I would get my money back if I didn't pass the test (or if I wasn't issued my visa), and she said yes of course. So I sent them the 730€ in good faith and got my visa extended. A few weeks later I took the test, and leaving I felt very confident that I had done well. We would see the results on that Friday. So my friend who had also taken the test with them goes before me on Friday. He texts me that he had not enough points and they told him that they WOULD NOT be able to give him his money back and he would have to retake B1 with them! They told him that if he wanted to take B2 he could maybe attend the first 3 or 4 days of class and if he was able to keep up they would allow him to continue. These were his only options! So I was very concerned that they would tell me something similar. I was preparing to demand my money back because I had just finished taking B1 and did very well in the class at AGI. So I rushed over there and asked for my scores. They told me that I also had not scored enough and that I had to retake B1 with them. I asked if I could do the same as my friend and try to attend the first few days and see from there. They told me no! I said they offered it to my friend and they told me his score was probably better than mine but for me it was not possible. Later I found out we had the SAME EXACT SCORE. I said there was no way I am going to retake B1 because I just spent two months doing B1 and how am I supposed to afford this?! These courses are not cheap! After a while of talking to the secretary they agreed to give me some of my money back, but they will charge a 50€ fee! Remember, earlier I had asked specifically if I would be able to get my money back and they said that would be no problem! No one mentioned I would have to argue with them for my money or anything about a fee! I told my friend that I got my money back and so he was very pissed that they didn't do the same for him. He went back and got his, but he was also charged this 50€. We both signed up for classes at AGI and there was no arbitrarily graded test and none of this drama! They also let us go to the course even though we couldn't pay until IFA finally sent the money back! Very nice of AGI! Long story short, they gave us each completely different information on two counts - firstly that I could get my money back and he couldn't, and secondly that he could try out the first few days and I couldn't, despite having the same scores. I don't know what this is about! If we hadn't been friends and been able to compare our experiences, we would both have been screwed! I don't know why they are telling people different info, deceiving me by saying there would be no problems getting the money back. All I can say is they want to force some to retake a lower level with them so you end up studying with them longer and they make more money! Not cool! If anyone is looking for a great language school without any of this drama, I can highly recommend AGI (Anglo German Institute). They are great, friendly, and flexible! They really saved me by making a place for me in B2 after I got screwed over.\n",
      "I don't make it to the whitby area much but this is a must stop. I had the penne con pollo this time and it was great. The service is second to none and I highly recommend Brothers. If it is more than one you will need a reservation. If it is just one they have always seated me even if there was a line. This is the best Italian food around.\n",
      "Another exceptional meal at Brother's. We shared a beet salad, and really it was enough for a meal for two. Dressed perfectly, it included sweet, red onion, slices of orange, tomatoes and plenty of goat cheese. I also had the special which was chicken piccata - moist and fragrant with capers. The highlight for me? Addictive fettuccine Alfredo on the side - honestly, I had to push the plate away because I just couldn't stop eating it. As others have suggested, reservations are strongly encouraged. So make them and get here! Date night, celebration, or just plain dinner - a very good choice when you're in Whitby.\n",
      "It's not bad for your standard Italian fare. The food is decent, priced reasonably well, service is ok but don't expect too much. It's an older restaurant in an old strip plaza. The place needs a bit of a makeover and IMO, so does the menu. But hey, chef Ramsay can't be at all places.\n",
      "Good food, friendly service in a quiet neighborhood. It looks unassuming, but don't let that put you off. Had a very enjoyable meal and experience.\n",
      "Good service! Pasta nothing special and chicken parm was a whole chicken breast instead of cutlets. Therefore taste was disappointing. Portion sizes are good.\n",
      "I just took my parents to Brothers Restaurant for their birthday, and we had an excellent meal. The seafood pasta was incredible as always with shrimp, bay scallops and salmon. My wife had an amazing shrimp fetticine in a marinara sauce that was quite delicious. I had a New York steak that was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Our server was Alicia who was absolutely fantastic. She was extremely friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. She even noticed that it was a special occasion and asked if we would like her to take some pictures ... without even asking her! Brothers js a great family restaurant!\n",
      "THE best Italian restaurant in Durham Region. I know the website says Mediterranean, but it's all Italian to me. I've never had a bad meal and the service is pretty good. Ironically, the longest wait is getting your bill. Making reservations is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It's only open for dinner, so call ahead! It's got a 'nice' restaurant feel, so I wouldn't wear track pants. Everyone else seems to be dressed up for an occasion of some sort in there every time I'm there! Their website looks pretty new and there's not much on it. I assure you the menu is fantastic and it has to compete with the weekly specials. Not an easy choice: pasta, meat or pizza; you won't be disappointed. The décor needs an update, but is well taken care of and comfortable. We're not here to talk about seats, are we? NO. My step-dad, the resident pizza connoisseur, has never ordered anything else there and he was not disappointeds I ordered Cheese Ravioli in a rose sauce. Mmmmmmm. The giant raviolis were full of goat cheese and there was more than enough sauce to coat each one. My mom went with the salmon special. The fish was flaky and flavourful. It was smothered in a cream sauce and served with seasonal veggies. The desserts are the same desserts you can get at most restaurants. They're not made in house. They're as good as you can get anywhere. Usually too full for dessert anyway! This is our go-to for family events and special occasions. Everyone likes it, even the pickiest eaters! Brothers is a great hidden gem.\n",
      "I was in town for work and tried this place out. It was so good that I came back two days later. I had a small Hot 'N' Spicy pizza and tried a few of the local micro brews. The pizza was cooked perfectly. The pizza crust was thin and crispy and there wasn't too much sauce. The yellow peppers definitely added some heat but it wasn't overpowering. For dessert I had one of the best pieces of carrot cake I have ever eaten and lucky for me it was the last piece so it was extra big. The waitresses were very friendly and the service was fast. This place will definitely be one of my go to spots when I am in town for work.\n",
      "This restaurant is just average and not really an authentic Italian eatery. My colleague and I went there for dinner, and were disappointed based upon our experiences vs. what I saw on yelp. The appetizer Bruschetta was not made right as Italian style, and the entree Veal Parmesan tasted awful. Overall I'd not recommend this restaurant to someone who is looking to get some real Italian food.\n",
      "Best pizza ever! We used to order it a lot but started to get hooked on other menu items. Daily specials are always great. In house baked bread is incredible! Quality of food and service overall is always superb. You only find that kind of thing in family owned places. So last night we were in the mood for quality pizza but wanted to stay home and watch a movie. So we ordered ahead and picked up. One bite into it and I remembered why we use to have it as our pizza of choice! Quality of toppings, sauce and the dough.... Perfect! Honestly had to be one of the best I've ever had in!\n",
      "We came here again last night for dinner and the food and service were excellent. True to my word, I ordering the Chicken Marsala once again, in fact, three of us at the table did. This time I selected the creamy risotto with sun dried tomato and artichoke. Fantastic! My husband ordered the 8oz Sirloin topped with a red wine peppercorn demi glaze, also accompanied by the risotto ($19.95). I have to say, this was one of the most flavourful steaks I've tried in a long time. It was cooked to perfection and the little piece he offered to share with me simply melted in my mouth. Delicious! As always, the wait staff are excellent here and believe me, they hustle! I honestly can't get over how busy this restaurant is (well, I can, considering how good the food it) but it's crazy! Make sure you book reservations well enough in advance if you're planning on going. Oh, and another thing I should mention which I didn't know before... you can order pizza for take-away. A little too far away from where I live to benefit me but for those in the area, I think this would be brilliant.\n",
      "The food was just ok the fettuccine had to much garlic, escargot was nice flavor but could off been warmer. The French onion soup was also the same tasty but void of been warmer. The price is reasonable for the quality\n",
      "Brothers Restaurant is located in Whitby and can be difficult to find if you don't know its there. While my boyfriend has pointed it out numerous times, I probably would have gone right by the tiny plaza its housed in without a second thought. My boyfriend decided to take me out for dinner here on Valentines Day. We had a reservation for 7:30 and I had no idea what to expect given that it was a holiday where people go out to eat all the time, meaning it would be VERY busy. We walked in and I was pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere. It's not a huge restaurant but its not crowded. The tables are far enough away from each other that you don't feel like you're sitting on top of someone and its got a very warm feeling to it. We arrived a bit early and had to wait for our table but were seated promptly at 7:30 as per our reservation. I ended up starting with the Caprese salad and had Scaloppine Piccata Al Limone (veal with capers, lemon, butter and white wine) with pasta on the side as my main. Our salads came out quickly and good lord... if you do anything when you come here, try the Caprese salad. Not only do I love caprese salad but I love GOOD caprese salad and this one was TO DIE FOR. I could have eaten three more and that would have been good for dinner! Wonderfully fresh bocconcini cheese with tomatoes and basil drizzled with balsamic and olive oil. The balsamic was incredible, probably some of the best I've ever had. Our meal was out fairly quickly as well, even though the restaurant was full, the kitchen staff really know what they're doing here. Everything was well timed and at the appropriate temperature when it arrived (warm bread, hot food, etc). My dinner wasn't exactly what I was expecting (who knows what I was expecting... not even me...) but it was superb. The veal was tender and the sauce was super flavorful. One bite with the capers and I was in heaven. The pasta served underneath it had almost a rose sauce on it and was a nice addition to the meal. The fresh veggies were nicely done and still a tad crispy, which is perfect. Nice portion size, not too much but not too little. Overall, everything was fantastic, couldn't ask for more for a special dinner out. Our server was excellent, stopping by just enough so that we felt taken care of but not so much that we felt smothered. I will absolutely come back to Brother's again in future and I look forward to trying something else of the menu!\n",
      "This a great little gem of a friendly neighbourhood restaurant. Great Italian food; for the most part I just have a salad and the hot and spicy pizza. The pizza is the best I've had in recent memory.\n",
      "Best Pizza in town! It is not a thin crust pizza but that's okay because their dough is made fresh in house and you want every last bite of it. Very cheesy and delicious pizza.\n",
      "Food isn't all that good. Way overpriced. Would not recommend. Terrible for kids, or elderly people. Not good if you dislike fancy Italian food. If you want some more normal, casual food, you're right out of luck. This would be a good place for a middle aged, decently wealthy (or at least not poor, if you're gonna waste your money somewhere, don't waste it here) couple going out for a fancy meal.\n",
      "We attended Brothers as a party of 6 for a small celebration. We made a reservation and our table was ready and waiting when we arrived. The corkage fee was quite reasonable, so we were happy about that, however the restaurant did not have a wine decanter. No big deal there, but a little odd. We ordered bruschetta and escargot for appetizers and both were very good. For the mains one person ordered pasta, 4 had steak and one the veal. The pasta was the most tasty dish out of the three (penne con pollo). Our own mistake for ordering steak at a pasta and pizza joint. One was severely undercooked. When we pointed it out to the server she transferred it to another plate and had it cooked some more. The steak also had a fair bit of grit to it. We poured our own wine and were not offered coffee or tea after our meal. Our server was friendly enough but we would likely not return.\n",
      "Take a break from the hum drum and/or get out of the hustle of life for an hour or so. Come in to Brothers and relax and dine on great food and enjoy awesome service, and I can't stress this enough: leave room for dessert!\n",
      "I would highly recommend this restaurant! I would also highly recommend making a reservation. We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 and the place was packed. Great atmosphere, great service. I had 3 options I couldn't decide on for dinner - the waiter, Jarrett made his recommendation and I was not disappointed. The Chicken Marsala with Mushroom Risotto was incredible - I kept eating long after I was full. The portions are very generous. My husband ordered the New York Striploin and was very happy with his choice! We will definitely be back - I need to try the other two options on the menu that I couldn't decide on :)\n",
      "I love Brother's restaurant, it's a popular spot for my family on special events like birthdays and anniversaries. The food, simply put, is amazing. I've only ever had a few of their pastas but the pizza is the best in Whitby bar none. Staff is friendly and accommodating and the owner frequently makes his rounds throughout the restaurant and speaks with everyone. Don't let the scuzzy parking lot throw you off, this is an awesome place to eat!\n",
      "Sat at our table for two in the middle of the restaurant for close to 20 minutes after being seated by the owner Chris. Watched waitresses pass by our table numerous times looking at us with our menus closed ready to order. After watching people seated after us with bread on the table and glasses of water poured, it was very clear that we were not going to rate in their eyes. My wife and I were hungry and tired of being ignored so we got up and left. Chris clearly couldn't give a damn because he was too busy chatting up his regulars. Some of the waitresses were to busy chatting with the other diners. I have no idea if the food is any good. We never got a chance to try. If it's anything like the service tonight, it's worth going somewhere else. I prefer going to a restaurant that recognizes that service is an equally important part of the dining experience. Almost as important as taking the dinner order to get things started. We ended up going down the street to Hot Rocks. Just as busy but they managed to seat us have drinks on the table and dinner served in and us out the door in one hour.\n",
      "I went in and the person who sprays wasn't in. So with persuasion from the lady at the front desk and very detailed directions as to how to use the stand up spray bed, I opted for it as my only choice. (I needed an instant tan) She swore if I followed her directions (which I did to a \"T\") that I'd have a beautiful bronze but natural looking tan. Unfortunately, that was not the case at all! The next day not only was my pale skin extremely orange (the worker said she was also extremely pale and used the setting she recommended) but my skin was also streaky and blotched with orange splatter. I was attending a wedding 3 days after this session and had to buy a sea salt scrub, a harsh scrubber, unlike a lufa, and make-up to look semi-normal. Last and most sadly, I had to avoid cameras on my friends' special day like a sniper. I have gone to many tanning salons but never have I, in my life, had to pay for the spray plus all the extra to cover and scrub the... \" tan\" off. On the plus side, the salon was clean and the employee was extremely nice but obviously not helpful or knowledgeable of spray tanning. So my advice to future customers: do your own homework, really look at their product and the out come. Possibly ask to do a test area before you become a large, walking multi colored orange carrot. Or probably best to wait for the person who sprays so they can really match the pigment. Otherwise, be prepared to pay and flush down the biffy 3x the amount of money you paid for the \"tan\" so you can turn around and do your damnedest to get rid of it!\n",
      "Great place for a tan, different beds to choose from and definitely a friendly environment. I had a spray tan done for a competition from Jess, the tan was amazing and she was a professional who truly cared about the quality of her work! I would absolutely recommend Planet bronze and Jess to everyone! Thanks again!\n",
      "I love this place! Everybody there is friendly and professional. I especially love their infrared light treatment for wrinkles. It works. I'll be going back often!!\n",
      "Great place to tan! Cute salon. Also very clean. Amazing staff. Go check it out! You guys have to try it. You'll love it!!!\n",
      "Friendly staff. Clean beds. Other options/services other than tanning beds. Try their hydration bed, really makes you feel great after using it! I tried other tanning places in the area, but this location is convenient and like I said, the owner and staff are all very friendly!\n",
      "Been waiting forever to get a drink through the drive thru. Only 5 cars in front of me and have been waiting over 15 mins. Probably going to be closer to 20 mins now....\n",
      "I can't believe I am giving a Starbucks a 1 star review. That being said, I stopped in at this Starbucks after a meeting with my photographer for my wedding and before I had to be at work. It was convenient for me and in the area. There's a drive-thru, but because I had plenty of time before I had to be at work I figured I would just go in. The place was full of people, but there were some free seats. I walked right up and put in my order. Mocha, iced, non fat, no whip. Doo doo doo.... So I figure I'll go sit down at a table and wait. Surely I will hear them call my drink. NOPE. Not once did I hear my drink called. NOPE. DIDN'T CALL MY DRINK. So I walk up to the bar (mind you, it's really only been about 4 minutes, but there was ONLY 2 people who ordered after me) and I see my drink, just effing sitting there. As I see it, the barista starts to take it away and gives me this \"WTF do you want?\" look. And then he snottily says, \"Are you waiting for a drink?\" And I said, \"YES\" and he says, \"Well we've been calling this one out for awhile.\" YEA. CUZ I TOTALLY DIDN'T HEAR YOU CALL MY DRINK IN THE QUIET, SMALL AREA WE'RE ALL IN RIGHT NOW. What a little bitch.\n",
      "This is the slowest service. After waiting 20mins or longer, the barristas still get orders wrong 90% of the time..We stopped going. We rather drive 3 more miles down rainbow to get a decent statrbucks coffee.\n",
      "I try not to review every single Starbucks and Coffee bean that I go to because probably it will be about 80% of my reviews, but I came to this one this morning for my regular coffee and this place is very nice. Nice location and parking. The place is large (or maybe because I am used to the ones in Los Angeles, which are very small) and has a lot of chairs and sofas, so even when they have a lot of customers , the place doesnt feel that crowded. The staff is very friendly (again, probably because I come from LA so I am not used to that). Free wifi (although you get that everywhere nowadays). So nothing else to add..just enjoying my Cinnamon dulce latte and writing reviews!! Enjoy.....\n",
      "Took literally almost 30 minutes to get my peppermint mocha using the drive thru... Longest one in my record!!!\n",
      "This has to be the busiest Starbuck's in the Southwest Valley. This cafe has been hyper-jumping both times I have been here. It feels more like being in a party than a cafe. It also looks like it was recently refurbished. There are.various seating arrangements. The neatest seating are the three stools at the counter. This Starbucks is the Southwest version of the Eastern at I-215 Starbuck's. It is hyper jumping. Open 24 hours, with thr exception that it closes 1-4 on Mondays. And adjacent to a Fitness center.\n",
      "Love that they are 24 hours! Had to get a prescription for my baby at 1:00 am and was nice to be able to grab a hot tea while I waited on the medicine. Super nice barista too.\n",
      "1 star by default for being a mostly reliable chain cafe 1 star for great wifi and chill atmosphere 1 star for being open 24 hrs Minus 2 stars for rude baristas who don't understand the first thing about customer service. Customer service tips for the baristas: Acknowledge your patrons, especially when there is a long line forming instead of having a prolonged conversation with your friend/coworker. Make eye contact with customers (etiquette 101). Don't act like customers are impinging on your time and everything they ask for is a nuisance. You are there to serve not be served on. We all understand that this is a busy location and that you have to deal with a lot of people. However, it's no excuse for dropping the level of customer service. If you want decent tips, then raise the bar of your service.\n",
      "Waited in the drive thru for about 15 minutes just to have them tell me they were all out of my drink when I got to the window. Poor, slow service and in a terrible neighborhood. Not going back to that one again!\n",
      "Regular meeting place when I'm in town. When my coworker and I meet up after visiting clients at Vegas, we meet up over here since it's next to the 24 Hour Fitness and Walgreens. Far from the strip, so you get the local hangout here, you don't get the rowdy Vegas party goers and you can have a quiet meeting.\n",
      "Order was wrong. Had someone pick me up an Evolution Fresh Sweet Green Smoothie and staff at Starbucks gave the Evolution Fresh Sweet Greens and Lemon Juice Bottle and said this is the one. I'm assuming the staff didn't know the difference between the two. Very upsetting.\n",
      "Needed to kill some time one Saturday afternoon. Found this on the map. Rather roomy with multiple spots for electronics, but it may be full. Oh, and if the bathroom is locked make sure someone didn't just lock it on the way out.\n",
      "Great service and very friendly. The gal from Yakima, WA was fun to talk to.\n",
      "Still slow service She handed me my venti today and says ooh its coming out the top So by the time i take it and get to the door its running down my arm and still coming out of the top. I walk to the napkin counter and its EMPTY Im wearing a WHITE long sleeve top after all its easter I head to the counter afraid to set it down that it will get worse and i ask for a napkin and she looks at the mess and says.... Ill get it in a minute Seriously????? Its now on my arm and has dropped on my white pants She brings a whole thing of napkins out and fills the dispenser and hands me some I swear they know theres no place else around here for coffee so they just DONT GIVE A SHIT Next week im getting coffee in summerlin at the coffee beanery and see if its any better. 7/25 Todays coffee wring again Two scoops java chips it looks like they put the whole container in extra caramel, not one bit of caramel in it As usual its 2pm so its not like its 7am Too bad its wrong again I may start a lig here of what i order and what i get...\n",
      "BIG plus for me is they're opened 24-hours 7-days a week! BIG minus is that on my first visit they refused to give me the code to open the bathroom door. I get the reasons why, but I'm not a street person. I've been a frequent customer of SBUX for many years. I go to a SBUX at least 2-3 times a week and usually order a Trenta Black Iced Tea using the mobile app. I was from out of town and had been there about an hour to get some last minute work over the Internet completed when nature called. I've never before been hassled to use the restroom at Starbucks. I ended up ordering (even though I didn't want it) my usual to get the code. Just seemed a bit tacky to me. I downgraded this store to a three star rating for their lack of customer service.\n",
      "Open 24 hrs except Sundays closes at 4 am for cleaning. Helpful happy employees , clean , ethnically diverse patrons and plenty parking unless you are one of those people who must park right in front. They don't seem to mind when tons of people ask for free ice water. Indoor seating gets filled during peak hours. NOTE : late at night the outside area can attract pan handlers and people who will approach you with \"emergency situations\" that need your financial help.\n",
      "If I could give less Stars I would. This has got to be the slowest Starbucks I have ever been too, and I have been to a lot all over the country. Of course I am from the Seattle area so my expectations are high. But when there are only one or two cars ahead of you in the Drive-Thru line and it takes 10 minutes that's crazy and this is the 4th time I've been here and going inside is even worse. My order was correct but the wait times are crazy. Very disappointing\n",
      "Starbucks may be a corporate store but the employees at this location make you feel like you are in a family owned cafe by how attentive they are. I've been going to this location for over 7 years now and have received great service almost every time. My drink is always made perfect. If it isn't, they gladly remake it with a sincere apology & smile. When you can drive up and just say Hi to the intercom and they know who you are & what your order is... That's great customer service. Shout out to MiKayla & Robyn for being those amazing baristas that keeps me coming back.\n",
      "this is probably the worst Starbucks drive thru I've been to, waited about 20 min. idk if it's me but isn't that kind of long for a drive thru? the most I've waited was like 10 min or so, maybe because it's the only 24 hour location off the strip? but they are completely slow, if you'd come to this location in the morning id suggest leaving 30 min. early lol pretty ridiculous\n",
      "I've never been crazy about Starbucks when compared to a mom and pop shop but this is one of the few Starbucks that is done correctly the baristas quick and efficient and when you ask for light ice it gives you light ice\n",
      "Great crew at grave yard shift! The rest are ok they get a 4 star.\n",
      "ugh!!!! The only good thing about this Starbucks is, it's open 24 hour hours, and closer to home for me. Especially working grave and going to school in the evenings, it's a life saver for the needed caffeine. Especially when I go to the drive through, it seems like I get the same idiot who always get my orders wrong. I asked for a venti, he tries to gives me a grande. I asked for a cup of water in the same order, he charges me for a bottle water! He even tried to charge me for the wrong order, which is almost double!!! It's been like this since around September, and I don't know how he keeps his job, with him constantly making a mistake!!! IF I have to, I'll go inside. I will ask for someone else if he takes my order, because knowing him, he will screw up my order and over charge me. It's a good thing I pay attention with this idiot!\n",
      "Stopped by for a frappucino and latte with a lollipop for granddaughter. All was good great service and drinks were quick.\n",
      "One of the few Starbucks that are open 24hrs. No matter what time you come here, it's always filled with people. This is not a place where you can study unless you're one that can study in an active and noisy setting. I came here at 3am and there were still a good amount people. Free WiFi but more of the concern is finding a seat where you can use your laptop. Would have given this a 2 star but I kinda have a crush on one of the barista in this joint. She's cute, cool funny personality...oh i better shut up, i'm going off the subject. So yea, this place is very active and crowded so I recommend another place if you go during the early hours because this place gets crowded.\n",
      "They have an okay service need more than one people working there . They take too long , but they are nice employees\n",
      "This place is probably one of the busier Starbucks in town wing open 24/7. Although I love the fun personality of the baristas at Starbucks.. Asking me if I wanted a hot or cold frapp and proceeding to get annoyed with my response is definitely not funny. \"I'd like a grande pumpkin spice frappucino.\" \"do you want that hot or cold?\" \"I'd like the pumpkin spice frappucino please?\" \"I heard you the first time do you want it hot or cold?\" \"... Cold?\" \"ugh next window please, you have no sense of humor\" And no I don't have a bad sense of humor, you have a bad way of earning tips. Insulting your customers, not apologizing, and having an attitude= bad for business.\n",
      "Great place to chill..one of the few Starbucks in town open 24 hours. It is always crowded especially at night but the people working there are nice and quick at delivering orders.\n",
      "I am a regular at about 3 Starbucks' locations here in town and this is by far the worst one. Yes, they are very busy, but this does not excuse the mediocre service and dirty tables on a regular basis. This location seems to be the preferred spot for local cabbies and you can almost always count on a 8-10 person line, which is fine and does not factor into my 2 star rating for this Starbucks. What DOES affect my rating are at the following 1) Consistently dirty tables, floors, and restroom. You can almost always count on having empty cups, spilled milk/half and half, sugar, etc both on the tables and on the straw/napkin area. Seems like perhaps a lack of proper staffing and/or lack of awareness. 2) Compared to other Starbucks, staff seems extremely smug and unhappy except for 2 or 3 employees. Yes, we know it's busy and this location is probably more difficult than other locations, but you have a great job and are consistently busy. 3) Regardless of how complicated your drink is, you are PAYING good money for it. My drink is almost $7 and I have at least 5 per week. No other location has ever had an issue making it, yet here, \"Ben\" the barista, seemed to have a problem with how the drink was ordered and when he called it out at the bar, he used a very smug and sarcastic tone which is NOT appreciated. If you don't like your service job, don't be in service buddy.\n",
      "Five stars for being around 24/7 when I need the restroom so bad everywhere was closed or not allow @ grave yard I went to 50 Place try to use the restroom they all said rest close at midnight in Las Vegas? only sweet Starbucks here is my lifesaver love love love.\n",
      "I used to go to this location as my usual hangout spot with my usual hangout group seeing the usual regulars and the usual employees... but that's all changed. I don't knew what or when they decided to stop giving a hoot here. They renovated the place and now it looks cheap. There is always something wrong with the bathrooms... ALWAYS. Half of the staff is unhappy now and the outside sitting area is seriously gross. I don't know what's going on but I bet it has to do with the new Charles Frias park they built across the street. If there's a park nearby, it's a living area for many homeless people and I've seen a increasing number of them in that area, even saw a few \"bum fights\" happen while I was there. They need to clean up the outside of their establishment, maintain the inside, and (actually this one is for the business that manages the building complex area) better patrol their customers. I have much more to include but I think I've made my point clear.\n",
      "I'm sitting here in front of the drive thru and it's horrible experience! As we approached the window the starbucks attendant just closed the window without saying anything and let us wait for 10mins! And never apologize for the wait!!!!!\n",
      "A-OK Starbucks located on Tropicana. The location is open 24 hours which is great. Staff is neutral (not rude but not overwhelmingly friendly). I did notice some peddlers outside the shop though, which is not great.\n",
      "The longest I've waited in a drive thru for just ONE drink... Come on it's only coffee! Y'all gotta learn how to communicate we ordered twice one on the machine and the other at the window boohoo\n",
      "This is the worse Starbucks ever!! Drinks taste like crap and you wait in line for 20min every time. Customer service, you can forget about it.\n",
      "Writing this review as I'm leaving, after spending 15 mins waiting for a drink. First - they're doing construction on their drive thru and when we ask if it's closed off completely the girl simply says \"yes and no.\" Okay? The line wasn't stupidly long the way you'd think a Starbucks with no drive-thru would be but they were training people so we ended up waiting forever on one drink. A hot drink, and not to mention that three people after us got their drinks before us; two people ordered multiple drinks. I, like a lot of people, have been to multiple Starbucks locations and this is the only one where I constantly see the same people either chatting it up with customers in the drive-thru and holding up the line (one time I witnessed a conversation that lasted about 10 minutes) and inside the store I constantly see a long line and baristas just standing there, letting one person do everything.\n",
      "This place used to have the speediest service. Now, I've been late for work twice because of the long wait at the drive-thru. Short line, long wait. Get your act together, please!!\n",
      "I've been in the line up so long I thought I would write a review!!!! Smell is very odd and even though there aren't a lot of people we have been here forever, just waiting.....\n",
      "Worst Starbucks in Las Vegas. If you go in prepare to wait an eternity as the feckless crew forgets to put your cup in like with the endless others from the drive thru which they prioritize over the walk-ins. After 15-20 minutes of wAiting we finally asked for refunds (including dollar tip I had given). The \"supervisor\" didn't offer to comp our drinks or anything and tried to play it off as drive thru back orders caused our delay but it was really the cashier girl who dropped the ball. They are slow and they don't care about customer satisfaction. The Starbucks nearby on Flamingo is much better and that's where we went and had our drink in less than five minutes.\n",
      "Fast drive through.....awesome customer service.....great pumpkin spice frapp.....this Starbucks is on a very busy corner was very impressed with there quick service....will def. stop by again\n",
      "All you need to Stay woke, with different snacks,sandwiches,some are 24 hours check before you go all the way over to one that is Not open.\n",
      "ugggggh im so disappointed i usually go to this location whenever i want a large frappucinno ... i waited in the drive thru for 20 min all so i can get to the window and them look at me like a criminal because i had my hubbys card (although they coulda asked for an id) the \"manager\" denied my payment so i left ....my husband was stiLl in his craving so he goes back with his card and we deff have enough funds but his card was denied but wen i go to check my account the charge from them is there so i call... i shouldnt of done thatthe girl says theres no manager available and says shes checking all charges and i dont have a reciept she cant help me ... but the charge is still there am i crazy???? im just mad cus they charged for something i never got and the \"manager \" talks to me like im cray cray im not the type to put in complients but heres a big one i will deff NEVER Go back to this location\n",
      "This is based upon my recent drive thru experience; I've been inside before. Not impressed with either. Upon rolling up to the ordering board, whoever was working the drive thru was clearly not interested in taking orders let alone taking them correctly. I was invited to spend a few minutes looking at the board as she would be back in a few minutes. Upon hee return, I repeated my order 3 times. \"Hot grande toffee nut latte with soy, whip & no foam.\" The first time she just wasn't paying attention; it took 2 other tries to get it right. When I arrived at the window, she repeated my order and AGAIN it was wrong. I told her not to give me a drink unless it was made with soy; i will know after the first drink if it's wrong & I will get seriously sick if they try to pass it off as right. She looked at me like I was from another planet, then questioned me about the whip. My dietary issues aren't her concern...just make my drink the way I ordered it. They got it right the 3rd time. My office frequents this location multiple times a week for TO GO coffee runs. My order is always the same. They NEVER get it right. I am always sick after the first drink of my latte. Really tired of wasting my money here...$5 for a sip of latte that gets binned & I'm sick all day because they make drinks how they want to instead of how the customer orders them. The service isn't great either.\n",
      "One of the only Starbucks I actually LIKE to drink at. They're very consistent, most likely due to the huge number of customers they get on a daily basis. This place is always packed. Aside from the consistent drinks, the abundance of outlets, its close proximity to my house, and 24 hour opening hours make it a great place to study. However, it's often TOO packed. The outside seating is always full of taxi drivers and Asian international students. It's impossible to walk into this Starbucks without wading through a thick cloud of cigarette smoke. The seating indoors is pretty abundant, but the number of single patrons taking up tables that fit 2-4 people are equally abundant. I try to come here after midnight for late night studying if I really can't concentrate at home.\n",
      "I have been a very loyal Starbucks fan and gold card holder for many years now, so when it comes to drinks, my palate can definitely tell the good from the bad. This location is definitely a miss--both in service and the quality of their drinks. There is something always wrong at this Starbucks. I come here often because it is only a couple blocks from my house and in the beginning, I thought okay maybe it was just a coincidence, but time after time, there is always something wrong. After todays \"oppsies\", I had to write this review. Here are a list of the mishaps that I remember off the top of my head: 1. Asking for less ice and getting more ice than normal. 2. Their mobile site offered Chestnut Praline Latte only for them to say that they no longer offered it. Other stores had no longer offered it and made the change on their mobile site. This location did not make the change until a month later. (Yes, I kept a keen eye on them). 3. Always out of strawberries for their strawberry acai refresher. Excuse: \"We are never sent strawberries.\" Put in an order for goodness sake! 4. Drizzles of caramel always on the outside of the caramel macchiato cup :O 5. Electricity shortages. 6. Drinks seem very diluted compared to other Starbucks locations. Skimping out on the espresso and filling cold drinks up with too much ice or milk! My pink drink always tasted like diluted strawberry flavored water and when I was finished with my drink, my cup was still 50% full of ice :( 7. Baristas are always chit chatting and messing with on another while the customers patiently await their drinks. I have always given this Starbucks location a chance time after time, but after todays oppsies, I will not be returning and I hope you do not either. Drive yourself down a couple blocks and there will surely be another Starbucks ready to make your drink tastier and with a smile :)\n",
      "Worst Starbucks experience ever.. And I'm not one to write bad reviews unless it really deserves it. Spinach wrap was tossed on a wet counter and was still rock hard frozen inside... Originally asked for it to be extra toasted. Floors were disgusting. Counters were out of certain sugars, spilled coffee all over and the one container the had didn't say what it was, and was empty. Junkies in the bathrooms shooting up. Some of the people working there were just not competent... When we asked to get a refund on the order, she asks, what part? \"All of it, thanks.\" There was more but this review would be really long.\n",
      "excellent barristers, great clientelle, all Asian and Ethiopean customers, a few Arab nation people, at midnight all the young Japanese and Chinese girls with beach blonde hair come in wearing spike heels and the latest fashions, many of my fellow students from UNLV also. Homeless people and meth-addicts have a bad habit of using and holding up the rest-rooms., coffee could be better (stronger) some of the barristers have a habit of brewing it rather weak to their liking. All the employees are the best instead of the short fat guy that is rude with no personality on the later shift. dont go for the free wi-Fi..its the slowest in the world, One big problem they have is homeless people sleeping in the recliners and snoring loud. The employees never wake them up or are too busy to go over and shake them. Lots of free sleepers. so you wont be able to get a chair.\n",
      "Terrible drive through experience. Terrible service. We were prepared for a long wait the line at the drive-in was crazy but we weren't prepared for every food item we ordered to be out, after specifically asking if it was available. To top that off the substitutions we were offered were also out. Insult to injury this is the second Las Vegas Starbucks I have been to that refused to make items off the secret menu. Really?? Every other city I have been to will serve a grasshopper frapachino... I will not be back to this store and I am filling a complaint with corporate.\n",
      "Ok I know thinking what is there really too add too another Starbucks review. It not as though its major chain and seen one seen them all. It not often that you find ones that stay open 24 hours. I did notice that they do close from one hour in day 3:30-4:30. I still remember the first time heard them staying open 24/7 like YES Frappuccino urge good too go! Naturally I had too order one. I went with one of the newer (on my menu brought it back) ones Mocha Cookie Crumble. Good. Honestly think next time would stick with the safe or my favorite just straight up Mocha or Caramel. I never got much of hint of Cookie in it, Mocha definitely had nice flavor, and Crumble no idea where that was in it. Still any Frappuccino on hot Vegas day is a beautiful thing. The interior design talk about completely updated or really has been years since the last time stopped by this location. It felt like night and day for me. Now you have whole deli section with sandwiches, other drinks besides coffee (bottle water, fruit juices, and lot of different selection can choose) can purchase, and like the fact its separate rather then in front of the register area. Still have nice display of baked goodies like normal. Instead of all stand up tables or tables. They still do but have one long rectangle table more like family table can sit down with lap top get stuff done and have your coffee. The artwork hanging all around the walls really modern too the lighting fixtures. All creating great ambience too kick back with coffee chill do some reading, talking stories with friends, or going on lap top do whatever. The only negative is this location is pretty busy all the time.. I go too the gym all the time in the same shopping plaza and always people going in and out or hanging outside little patio area. The service was great! I did find it odd that she never mention about HH price on Frappuccino from 3-5. I was wondering why my grande was so cheap. Unfortunately only promotion till next week. If looking for a laid back Starbucks one that nice size, great place too people watch too since so busy, great ambience, and relax with friends. I would recommend coming too this location. Hopefully able too find spot too sit down can be a drawback.\n",
      "All i have to say is......... DRIVE THRU!!!! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas. Ok bye.\n",
      "Love my Starbucks, but it sucks sitting outside, to many pan handlers.\n",
      "On Saturday morning, at 10:00, there was only one person in line in front of me. The building was packed, however. I ordered my usual Vanilla Latte, but it tasted slightly burnt and under flavored. I was in a hurry, so I didn't ask them to fix it.\n",
      "Drive thru is slooooooow, inside is slooooooow. I could roast my own beans by the the time it takes to get a drink here. There can be 4 cars in the drive thru and its 10-15 min some days!\n",
      "I believe that it is time to update my review on this particular Starbucks! I am here now if not everyday every other day! I've been able to really learn the dynamics of this store and when the \"peak\" times and \"non-peak\" times are. I remember only giving them one star on my original review due to some of the extremely busy times that I have encountered. Guess what I have learned though? MOBILE ORDER in the morning so that you are not sitting in that drive-thru for 20 minutes or more. It's no secret that this location can get extremely busy! They also can't help the fact that they do sometimes get people in that drive-thru who order $50 worth of stuff that they should've went inside for. Please don't be that person who is ordering a million and one things through the Drive-Thru! You are hindering the ones who actually would like to DRIVE THRU damn it! The workers here are amazing and I really have gotten to know majority of them by name as they know me. Throughout all of the madness that goes on here they never once stop smiling and continue to do their jobs. Yes I've still had a few hiccups since then however how they handle and own the problem is what actually matters the most. They went from being my LEAST favorite Starbucks to now my FAVORITE! One star all the way to FIVE! Now that my friends is amazing accomplishment as I do NOT hand out Five stars that easy!\n",
      "Okay Starbucks. I like the huge table they have. Sometimes they get the occasional homeless person but it's not too bad. Staff is always chill. Internet is great, cause it's Google.\n",
      "They made me one heck of a drink but it shouldn't take 30 minutes for that. I got in like at 2:10 in the drive thru. Ordered my drink at 2:29 l. Got to the window at 2:35. Left at 2:40. Quite ridiculous\n",
      "This is quite possibly the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. If you actually get the drink you order, in a reasonable amount of time, at the temperature you requested (hot vs. iced), and not too sweet or burned, it is an abnormal day. The place is typically packed with taxi drivers and other locals sitting around at the tables playing on their phones for hours. The staff is new or unprofessional. I once watched one employee dump ice into the bin, spilling it onto the counter and walk away coyly from (who I assumed) her manager. This is not a place you would want to come for a chat, to work or relax. Overall, unless you are going through drive thru and you don't care how your coffee tastes, go somewhere else....like the one in Boca Park.\n",
      "I'm from Seattle. I love coffee, and I'm a huge Starbucks fan..gold card, daily customer, etc... But what's happening at THIS location makes for a miserable experience. The drive-thru is terribly, terribly slow. More often than not, it's a 20 min wait in the morning. I've witnessed one drive-thru employee talking, laughing, after handing out the customers drink, with the line still piled up behind me. No apology. You need to leave home an extra 30 mins for your visit to Starbucks in the morning.. Going inside isn't much better or faster, dirty floors, tables, not to mention trying to navigate past the pan-handlers that are stationed at/near the doors. I gave up on this location. If you value your sanity, drive to another Starbucks. I hate to be harsh, but whoever is managing this store should be fired.\n",
      "They always make a mistakes im still waiting for my mobile order, i ordered 25minutes ago...they never said \"sorry\" f*** and her name is MONICA, always very rude and stupid attitude to customer\n",
      "I like the interior and location of this Starbucks. I used to work at the Home Depot across the street -- so I got used to this place before work. Anyway, besides applying here and not even getting called for an interview, lol, I liked this place...pretty large and comfortable seating inside. Fast and friendly service...and with a drive-thru. Parking is horrible though...as it shares it with like 4 other businesses...and there is also a Dennys right there. Oh well...nice Starbucks never-the-less.\n",
      "Staffing issues, management? Haven't seen only 3 workers at the counters at Starbucks in ages. Can't keep up with the volume.\n",
      "How does any female feel safe at this location with all the African migrant men hanging around?\n",
      "Always full and crowded but the EMPLOYEES are AWESOME! Always full of energy and friendliness no matter what time of the day it is. I've been here as early as 5am and as late as 1am and YES they are just AWESOME!\n",
      "Worst Starbucks ever! Seriously, worst service and takes a minimum of 20 minutes for your drink...and not because it's crowded, because there that slow... tried it several times and always at least 15 minutes for 1 order...\n",
      "I am extremely happy with the results, love my eyebrows. They are natural and beautiful. The staff is very nice and absolutely professional. Ambers hands are magic and trustworthy. I recommend it to anyone any day!\n",
      "Love waking up to my perfect brows! Thanks to the team at The Good Geisha for cutting the time it takes for me to get ready in the morning in half! Best decision ever.\n",
      "This was definitely a huge splurge for me, but I think it's worth it! It's so amazing waking up with brows; it cuts down on time I spend getting ready in the morning. I basically have no brows, and eyebrow tints don't work on me, so I was desperate for a solution and this was perfect. The only concern I have right now is that they're a bit dark for my liking, but I've heard that they do lighten up as time passes! This was my first time getting my brows done by a professional (I always did my own brows), so I was pretty clueless, but Anna was super nice and helped me figure out a good brow shape! The place was super clean and so were the washrooms!\n",
      "Markham station of 2017 is not the markham station of the past. Now only have they revamped their interior they have done wonders to the menu. Much cleaner and tidied interior with brand new fresh booths and a menu that's much more updated . We went Saturday evening for the breakfast and it was delicious. Everything was fresh and made to order and the service was awesome. Highly suggest for a quick bite to eat or if your craving breakfast foods!\n",
      "Pros: - huge portion sizes - relatively cheap food - 24 hour service - the wait staff are all very personable and friendly - relaxed atmosphere cons: - dirty place in general - greasy (though some people may find that a pro) Overall, I've gone here a few times and it's great for a late night binge with friends. I've never visited during their busy hours, and I've typically gotten their breakfast or fish and chips. The coffee is hit and miss, but if you can get a fresh pot it's quite good. I'll definitely go back when I've got a late night craving for greasy food!\n",
      "Okay, this is not some fine, dinning establishment. This is a diner. Not only that, but apparently it's a 24 hour diner, so that's pretty frigging awesome. Good to know. Those come in handy. As a diner, it's food was perfectly acceptable and actually very good. The service was excellent! Prices were decent. I don't know what else you need! I came for lunch with a ground of friends. We wanted drinks, we wanted food, some wanted breakfast food (they have all day breakfast...also awesome) and this fit the bill perfectly. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating and fast with the food and drinks. She split up all our bills for us, with no problem (so many places it's like the biggest deal ever). Everyone enjoyed their food and we certainly got a variety of it. All large portions. Drinks were good, so no complaints there! The atmosphere is...well let's call it quaint. It has some dated decor and paintings on the wall of a sort of olden-days train station. It's a diner, so it is what it is! Only criticism of this place is that it only takes cash. They have an ATM in the front, but be prepared. Otherwise, I would totally come back to this place! They made one mean grilled cheese!\n",
      "Markham Station is a throwback to the good old days when you could get a plate of artery clogging goodness for less than $10. Surprisingly, not much has changed here. If you get in early enough, you get their $5.99 deal which includes 3 eggs, bacon, and potato's, along with anything else they have in their kitchen thrown in for good measure. Apart from the usual breakfast foods of eggs, pancakes, french toast and omelettes, there's also a good number of more 'lunch driven' options like burgers and sandwiches. The club sandwich is particularly good. It's big, well put together and even comes with a pickle (yay). If you're in the mood for a traditional breakfast and looking for a Cora's alternative, then I would give this place a try. Just get ready to waddle home with a belly full of satisfaction.\n",
      "Came here for a very late dinner in the early mornings around 1am. The food quality is average but for the price you pay, it's quite a good deal. What is great about this restaurant is the service of the waitresses. Everyone is very friendly and makes the meal that much better.\n",
      "Been to Markham station multiple times before and after the renovation. Always end up going at the most oddest hours. The recent renovations are pretty nice, good face lit for the restaurant overall. For a place that operates 24/7, you gotta give them some slack. You cant be expecting top notch food. Been going for years, the foods been good and for the most part consistent. Home style taste but is a bit bland. Personally I try to gear towards the non breakfast stuff, like Greek diners, sandwiches, chicken mains, etc. Recently went with some friends, forgot the menu item name but got some sunny side eggs, chicken breast, and fries. They got the regular breakfast items. everything was cooked well. The food tasted as you would expect. Grilled chicken breast tasted like it was seasoned with just salt and pepper. But doesn't bother me cause its 6am, been awake for almost 20hrs, everything's closed, there's dew on parked cars, McDonalds is switching their menu so they wont serve, the city's waking up and I am eating something that's fresh and doesn't taste entirely like cardboard. For me that good enough. Good food that's always available. Overall 4/5. Only negative would be the inconsistent service.\n",
      "Horrible food but they are open 24hours. I'd love to say nicer things about this place because it's just down the street from my house, but they really have gotten lazy over the years. Used to be good fresh made food, but now everything is premade and not worth eating. I suppose it is nice to put in your order and have it in 5 minutes, but the trade off is it was likely made the day before and just tossed on the grill to warm. Because it is open all night they are busy when the bars close, but drunk people are not very picky. Anyways, about all I would recommend here is a coffee if you are up late, good luck getting a refill though, the staff don't pay much attention.\n",
      "Worst rude service ....Disgusting foods....salty left over heated burned creamy chicken soup .... Nasty undercook sausages....gross!!!\n",
      "This is a well known restaurant because it's one of the few places that is open 24hrs in scarborough. This place is only good for hangovers or an after club destination!\n",
      "One of the only true \"diners\" left in the east end. Great food, good family pricing and the staff is always friendly. Hard to find that combination nowadays. Prices are very reasonable, and the size and quality of the food is great . Very family friendly and you can't beat the early bird breakfast special.\n",
      "Food was amazing and the service was friendly and quick! The new renovations are beautiful, we had a very good experience here and will be back again soon!\n",
      "Worst place for breakfest nothing special and really really expensive. Everything is generic and the own is this greek or italian guy with a pony tail whos really really rude and doesnt care about his customers. I had the burger once, it was one of those frozen burgers u can find at any store for 25cents a peice. It had a dry bun and old veggies that have been sitting around for a while. This place is loaded with gangster wanna bees and thugs STAY AWAY!!!!!!!\n",
      "This was my first time at Markham Station and I don't think it'll be my last. My group of 8 and I came here at around 2am and seating was no problem at all. There are lots of large areas where all 8 of us could sit comfortably and on the same table. Being 24h definitely makes this spot a great option for late night owl and sometimes just because there's nothing else open. We had a very friendly waitress that was fairly attentive, no complaints on the service. The location was apparently renovated and it seemed like they did a good job. Decor was very nice and modern. We made the mistake of grabbing McDonalds before hand because we weren't sure if we were coming here or not, and boy was that a mistake. Almost all of us ordered \"The Super\" which is available all day and comes with 3 pancakes, 3 sausages, 3 strips of bacon and 3 eggs along with home fries. The bacon was extremely crispy, sausages were nice and juicy, pancakes and eggs were not bad, and the home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Really no complaints about this meal and none of us were able to finish. The best part is that the entire meal is only 12.99! As this being my first time here, I'm going to make sure I come on an empty stomach the next time! 4/5\n",
      "Been going for years and their breakfast is so good and great price. Love their dinners as well try their souvlaki dinner had that many times. JUST A GREAT RESTURANT REASONBILE PRICES AND GOOD HOME COOKING.\n",
      "Went here for a midnight fix of all-day-breakfast. The food was just alright, but nothing great. My girlfriend had found not only one strand of hair on her plate while munching, but two! As anyone would expect, she lost her appetite right after.\n",
      "wow this place is a dump, I was dragged here twice... once for breakfast only. We came after 11pm, so it was the all-day breakfast price, which was pretty high for a couple of eggs, sausage and fries. It was blah, it was plain old breakfast, what did I expect? the waitress kept forgetting my drink order... Just a cup of OJ please? didn't come till I almost finished my breakfast. nothing special to note, but it wasn't horrible. So I came back again for dinner (let's just say I will never EVER come back here again) I don't understand why there is so many elderly people dining here when the food is so HARD, GREASY and UNHEALTHY. My friend said he saw a $16.99 T-bone steak special and wanted to come and try... OK, except we came on a Saturday and it's not on special, so he ordered it anyways for $22.99 ($6 more) I order a half rack of ribs (I have no idea why, since it's NOT a smoke house or anything?) the meals came with salad or soup and a couple of garlic toast. The Caesar salad was overly dressed, and the house salad was plain to the max (with your choice of dressing) The ribs came and it was HARD as a rock! I ate one rib, and my friend tried one and that was it. The home style potatoes was I guess? I've had better ribs from swiss chalet (and I'm not a fan of this place either) The T-Bone steak was such bad quality I'm not sure if it is SAFE to eat medium-rare? My friend finished it anyways since he was hungry. Let's just say he had bad news when he talked to me the next day (something like going to the washroom in the middle of the night) and he is usually able to take anything. This place is dirty and food is gross.\n",
      "The worst place I've ever been to. To start, a busser splashed dirty water at my friend and I. They apologized so we let it go. But they didn't even give us napkins after we got wet. When they sat us at the table, there were crumbles all over the seats and oil stains everywhere. I had to go to the washroom and get toilet paper and soap to clean it myself. Our server was nothing special. She did not smile. She got us refills but she has not really present. We tried to ask other servers for service to order or napkins only to get yelled at. One server said in an angry tone that they are very busy and to go ask someone else because there are different sections. This restaurant has below average food. The servers are terrible and don't smile. There is no sense of teamwork what so ever. Every server is for themselves here. They do not prioritize the guest's needs. Rather they put themselves first. I have worked in a restaurant for 5 years. I noticed that the servers had a 5-6 table section on labour day. They do not walk that fast. They do not have full hands in and out of the kitchen. I will not be coming back here. This server even yelled at my friend and said she does not understand how the restaurant works. A tip: bring a raincoat because they will splash dirty water at you.\n",
      "This is my go to place from 3-5am if i don't want fast food or chinese. usually i'll order the pork souvlaki dinner. its a pretty big serving so i know im not leaving hungry. omelettes are great too. servers are very kind and friendly. it's usually not busy when i go, so service is pretty prompt. this place has been around for years and years and years, and it shows. a renovation may do wonders for them.\n",
      "Terrible service! I would give this place a negative if Yelp would let me! We waited more than 30 mins for our food and they serves us with the wrong order. We asked about our order since it was wrong and the waiter said \"it's okay, the chef does what he wants.\" In addition, we were in the middle of eating our food and our waiter rushed to clean up our table. He was extremely rude and didn't even let us enjoy the wrong order of food. Never coming to this place ever again!\n",
      "If only there was a way to rate this restaurant as zero stars. My friend and I were ignored at the door by a server writing 'no separate bills, no debit' on a blackboard. We were seated only to be ignored by our server who was rude. We went in there hungry and ready to eat and after seeing that I couldn't order what I wanted (a grilled chicken salad) we finally called it quits and walked out. This was the third strike Markham Station. I won't be going back.\n",
      "Food here is always a hit or miss. The food is never good, but could be really satisfying. Very family style cooking, like mama's cooking. They offer a very warm, friendly atmosphere, like how it would be like to go home to a small town. They make you feel right at home. Prices are fair.\n",
      "A real 24 hours restaurant and bar in Scarborough. Large very spacious, all day breakfast and a large menu with varieties. Been there many times (those late bites). A+ Great staff, very friendly and quick service. Food it's not the greatest but can't complain it's cheap and portions are huge.\n",
      "What can I say.. It's Markham Station. I don't come here for a fancy meal or attentive service, I come here for a cheap breakfast once in a while. It is typically as expected; alright, nothing fancy. Bang for your buck.\n",
      "Love coming here for fulfill my breakfast craving! Came here on Family day and there was seating room. Our server was friendly and pleasant. So with it to come here for lunch. The pork souvlaki was filling and delicious. Breakfast is always good good for parents with children. The booths can fit the car seat!! Always come here whenever we are in this side of town.\n",
      "I am a bit disappointed in my most recent trip to Markham Station. It was around 7:30pm on a weekend night, lots of empty seats. We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks which were really good and I would get those again. However, I ordered the Steak Sandwich which was just a strip of \"steak\" stuck in-between 2 slices of italian bread with lettuce and tomato on the side. HP sauce couldn't fix the bland taste of that steak. My friend ordered the Pork Souvlaki, although they give you a lot of food for the $15, it was not worth it. We didn't finish some of our food because of the quantity and the (lack of) taste and the waitress asked us why. Really? I would still come back here because it's convenient and just for breakfast, but I will still ignore the staffs' nosey comments.\n",
      "I thought about giving this place 1 star but because their breakfast is pretty good I gave it 2. A lot of people are complaining about the food and I'm surprised more ppl are not complaining about the service. There's one server there who sits and chats with customers and she doesn't come around to see how anything is, you literally have to go up to her and ask for whatever you need. And when you want your receipt none of them are anywhere in sight. If you have a lot of time to wait for refills your bill etc then this is a good place to go, if you wanna be in and out this is not a good place.\n",
      "Sometimes you just crave greasy diner food, coupled with rude service in the dead of the night, surrounded by questionable clientele. Markham Station has it all. Too expensive for what it is though. PS - they charge $1.50 for hot water. Sketchy move\n",
      "If you like to get heart attack from eating breakfast. This is the place to go. It use to be good like 15 years ago. Now this is just a hole. Even they say breakfast special $3.99 you bill will usually come up to 10 bucks per person. The whole place smell like you are in the kitchen. After you finish your meal you will want to go home and change. Unless you like walk around smelling like breakfast. :-)\n",
      "Great fish and chips. The servers are nice except for the one guy. Very greasy food so don't expect to leave feeling healthy, but you will feel full!\n",
      "This is one of two 24 hour restaurants that I know in the area are open. Such a convent place to go if you get hungry during the night. Accessible by ttc or car. Food is good , they have two sides to this restaurant. One side is the bar and the second side is the sit in restaurant. The bar side has tvs. This location has just recently been updated it looks really nice. Service is usually good. And food is usually quick. Their menu has a wide variety of foods to choose from for decent prices.\n",
      "Terrible service overall need to train there staff in customer service the food is not that great\n",
      "Extremely bad food. The black lady waitress gave us an attitude when I pointed out her bad service this very early morning. I talked to her why we were not happy with her service politely and calmly, but she talked me back without apology. She also raised her voice toward us. As an excuse, she said to us her shift was over long time ago, but she had to be there for her co-worker. So what? I did not give her tips after all this conversation. She behaved worse after.\n",
      "This place has seriously gone downhill. I used to come here often, seeing as how it was 24 hours and a good price for all day breakfast. The food has gone south. Had the steak and eggs for $13.99 and it was disgusting. I could go to T-Bonez and get an 8oz steak dinner for $13.99. The eggs were really dry. The steak was really dry. Everything was really dry. Our meals came with toast, and no jam! We were told we had to pay 20 cents per pod of jam. Hello? I think that if you're going to serve toast, the least you can do it provide you one pod of jam. Then charge extra for additional. The service was bleh too, I mean I guess you sort of expect it from a place like this. But our server asked only one person if they wanted white or brown toast. And then asked another person if they wanted home fries or something else. Aren't you supposed to ask everyone? Bad experience. Won't come back.\n",
      "Atmosphere: Big restaurant, lacks warmth, needs a major facelift Food: 1. breakfast speciall. 1/5 , 4.99 special, makes me wish i spent it on Tim Hortons instead. Bread was so buttery that it was no longer toasted, sausages were dry. Display of the food was so unappealing. Overal: we found food still stuck on the utensils, will most definitely not be back\n",
      "Came here for an early breakfast. This was by far the fastest breakfast i ever ordered, no exaggeration it was ready 4 minutes after I ordered. The eggs were poached perfectly. The hash browns were a bit bland, they could use some seasoning. Overall great experience and fast service\n",
      "Okay, let's be clear here. We're talking about a 24 hour breakfast restaurant that happens to sell other items cleverly disguised to be viable options at lunch and dinner. If you're on your cell phone and you're looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you've found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you're in the mood for. Servers are pretty quick here and when it's busy there's a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible. The decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side. This piece of wood that is elbow height can be removed to make the booths feel more like one unit. Someone put time and effort into this but it really doesn't improve any scenario when removed. TO SUM IT UP: Come here and get breakfast any time of the day but don't be dissuaded of the book by its cover.\n",
      "This is a great place for breakfast and late night eats. I always enjoy the super breakfast..enough food to last me till dinner! Granted it isn't the fanciest of places, it still gets the job done. Wouldn't recommend non-breakfast options however. Price is also very reasonable and staff are generally quite friendly. Weekends are absolutely jam packed so be read to wait.\n",
      "Horrible service. Arrived as a group - called days ahead - and they would not accommodate individual billing and were not staffed for a large group. For a place that advertises fast service it took nearly 90 minutes for our group to get served. Too 45min for drinks alone. Multiple people cancelled orders and left because we had younger children in our group who after 90 minutes of waiting the time of day had become too late for them. I had ordered the western sandwich and a milkshake. The food was sub par, bland, and mostly uninteresting. One of my fellow diners had a fly in their salad and another took 2 hours to get a glass of coke. Service was rude and indignant from the one server who handled a group of 40. She consistently complained about too many people and not having her coffee yet. I'm not sure how this is the diner's problem. Even after getting our food it took 30 or more minutes to get bills. Even after all this she automatically added 10% tip to the bills. TL;DR = Don't go here. Bad food, bad service. Legitimately the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.\n",
      "I think my reaction to this place is \"Meh\", but I come back whenever I'm in the area because I like breakfast food. Staff: It was easy to get a seat, and they took our order quickly but then for the most of the time we did not see our waitress, so getting the bill took some time. But they were not busy at all, in fact the wait staff was chatting with each other most of the time. Ambience: It felt dirty. The spoon I had was unclean, as if it was licked clean, rather than washed clean. The seats were sticky, and the place definitely looked like it could use some sprucing up. It doesn't have that nostalgic or home-like feel, so it just felt drabby. Food: It was alright. I had ordered their lunch special where you get toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and home fries. I wanted over-medium eggs but they came as over-well. I opted for sausage which were nice. They only had strawberry jam to go with your toast, which was disappointing. Overall it was nothing too memorable but I was full by the end of the meal. Also, apparently hot water is like $1+, which I didn't see in the menu so it was my fault. I do think that it could've been free though. It's alright, but I wouldn't seek it out.\n",
      "After a long night of partying, our group was tired and famished. Desperate for food, we luckily spotted Markham Station. All we wanted was something cheap and filling; this establishment filled that void in our stomachs. Markham Station had a very expansive menu including an all day breakfast menu. The food was plentiful but cheap, in which was reflected in quality. I ordered the well-done steak which was great, the eggs okay, but the fries were horrible. The interior likewise reflected the pricing of the menu; bland, few colours, but lots of windows. Service was slow and not very friendly. The crowd too seemed a bit sketchy but that maybe because we went at 2am. All and all, this place is like a downgraded Golden Grill. Open 24 hours, cheap but expansive menu with deplorable service and atmosphere. Dine here only if you are desperate for a filling meal at 2am!\n",
      "The super breakfast is always good. But last time I wanted something different and tried the quiche. Big mistake. Small portion and overcooked to the point that the crust was rock hard. Would go back but only for the breakfast specials.\n",
      "About the only thing it has going for it is that it's open 24-hours which is a rarity in that part of the city. The menu is extensive, but I get the impression that the reason they're able to do this is that a lot of things are frozen. The breakfast food is better than the rest of the menu I find. If you're hungry, it's late, you don't feel like asian food or driving to a better option downtown (like 7 West or Fran's) then it'll do.\n",
      "Came here on a Sunday morning - wasn't that busy. Was a little skeptical about the place when I first approached it and saw the exterior - but it was evident that they did upgrades on the interior. Fiance and I ordered the Super Breakfast (3 eggs, 3 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausages, home fries) and the Breakfast Special (3 eggs, 3 sausages, home fries and toast). We usually go to Sunset Grill for breakfast on weekends - but we changed it up and came here. It wasn't that bad.. food came out really fast, the eggs were cooked perfectly. However, the pancakes were a little too dense, I like my pancakes fluffy. As for the sausages, it was a little too salty and too overcooked. Bacon was cooked well - not too crispy. Would most likely come back again in the future.\n",
      "I went to this restaurant for brunch for the first time. From the outside, it seems a good choice However, when I got the order, it tuns out a wrong wrong wrong choice! The food tasted terrible! Eggs tasted like plastic, no mention about the fronze bacon and werid home made potota. I stop eating and left 99% of the food on my plate. What wrose was the bad customer service, or no customer service. I end up left the restaurant and no tip. Yes, the terrible food + bad customer service, do not worth a penny of any tip. Never never go there.\n",
      "Someone recommended this all day breakfast restaurant so I've decided to go and check it out. The service was awful. The waitress treated me as if I wasn't there. I've ordered a soup and breakfast but my soup never showed up and they served with wrong food. At the end, one of the complementary candies was missing. I will not go back.\n",
      "The quality of this place has been going down hill over the years. Its just a cheap place to get a 4.99 breakfast from 6am-11am. Nothing more nothing less. They do not have debit machines.\n",
      "This place is cheap and dirty. My work comes here for breakfast 3 times a year and the place always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I don't think it's food poisoning but a normal person cannot handle that much grease. After learning my lesson a couple times with their traditional breakfast or omlette, I have switched my order to a bagel and fruit bowl which is only mildly better. I usually find a few pieces of over ripe fruit in the mix. This place is somewhere I'd never choose to go on my own, but if all you're looking for is the absolute cheapest option, you may have found your place because the portions in the breakfasts are a decent size. Anyway, my recommendation would be to skip this place unless you love your grease served with a little egg and bacon. YUCK!\n",
      "Key Features: Banquet Burger, and the Paintings on the wall. I've been coming back to Markham Station for the better part of a decade. Why? Originally, it was because - when I needed a full belly at three o'clock in the morning, this was the only game in town. Well, there was Golden Griddle - but Markham Station was a cut above. 24 hour dining has never looked so good. To this day, I've only been in about 3 or 4 times before 11pm. My normal Markham Station experience takes place between 2 - 4am. The staff are great, and seem happy to be there. Which I've never understood, as they're working at 3 in the morning. But this is a big plus that not all 24 hour diners will offer. Next up is the banquet burger. Throw down some bacon, a moist, juicy, patty, and all the veggies you could want - and you're set. But then you end up with more fries than you'd see as a separate order in any number of other establishments. And then they give you a vat of mayonnaise. If, for some reason, there's not enough mayo, they'll keep hooking you up - free of charge. Now, the food - and the timing - that's just one small reason to show up to Markham Station. The other is the large painting on the far wall. The first time you see it, you'll just assume it's a train, pulling into the station. Then you start to notice details. First, little ones (like the giant goose standing on the horizon) then another - some of the people don't have shadows. The only explanation? Ghosts. In the house on the far right - often unseen due to it being blocked by the barricade to the washroom - there is a ghostly black face in the darkened window. Little by little the horror in this serene scene beings to grow. And then you notice there are other paintings on other walls. The more you notice, the more bizarre it all seems. But then you forget. And you're back to the burger. Ohh yeah - and if you get garlic bread with your meal? Eat it first. Otherwise it will cut apart the inside of your mouth, once it has hardened, at the end of your meal.\n",
      "I love breakfast and I do value good breakfast for a reasonable price. I like how big this place is and lots of room to sit down. But I didn't like the long wait time and also how late the staff were to serve me. The food quality was better than average but I have still had better ones. Overall an ok place to eat. Worth trying it\n",
      "Basic place. Good food. Good service. They charge for a cup of hot water here because people ask for hot water and bring their own tea bags. What do you expect in Scarborough anyways? Ghetto Disgusting washroom on a late Monday morning....and that was the womens washroom. Looks like it wasnt cleaned in 2 days. Had to tell the staff to go give it some attention.\n",
      "Not sure what's happened to this spot but the quality of the food has gone way down. Just left with my meal half eaten bc it was pretty much inedible. After ordering out meals, my gf and I were shocked at how fast our meals arrived, but were disgusted when everything we bit into was cold.. After getting the servers attention, she was kind enough to take them back and and again she was out quickly with our \"new orders\". These new meals were definitely hot, but the problem was there were the exact same meals we had sent back. The salt and pepper we had added were still there and nothing had moved... What kind of restaurant serves their customers cold eggs and then just reheats the dishes.. It's bad enough the food had been obviously sitting for a while, but then to just try to pass it off as new meals is ridiculous. Needless to say that was my last visit to Markham Station\n",
      "They are open 24 hours in Scarborough. What more do you want? lol You can't come here with super high expectations. Their all day breakfast is great however it is pretty greasy compared to other breakfast joints. They also serve different foods like souvlaki dinners, salads, sandwiches, ribs, roasted chicken and etc. I've only ever had their breakfast foods and chicken souvlaki dinner. Their portions are pretty big, you will not leave feeling hungry if you actually eat your food. Service here is pretty quick and they always have CP24 on. So catch up on your daily news and weather while munching away at some food that quick!\n",
      "When you have a table next to the bussing station, please be considerate and do not slam the dishes when you're putting them away. All the clanging made it hard for me to hear and eventually gave me a headache. In addition, there was a questionable spill on the floor of my booth as well as my seat. The food was alright. Typical breakfast for a decent price.\n",
      "I normally like these kinds of places, but this place disappointed me. Had the station fries cheese (fries with monterey jack cheese, plus a small container of gravy). The melted cheese was already cold by the time we got it. The gravy they gave us was far too small. There was nothing special about the fries. I don't think this dish was worth the money. Reviewing the menu now, I didn't even know it was supposed to have bacon! My main was a light caesar burger. The burger patty was slightly burnt. The caesar dressing was watery and had little taste. The burger came with lots of toppings including lettuce, pickle and tomatoes. The burger bun was cold. Overall, also a disappointment. The food also took a while to come out. At least service was friendly. I'd only come back again if I was hungry and it was the middle of the night and everything else was closed. Actually, maybe not - I'd just go to McDonald's.\n",
      "If you get here before 11am, breakfast here is super cheap and delicious (you really cannot go wrong with breakfast food anyway). Generally, I drop by here when Cora's is too crowded, because there's so much more seating here. However, the reason I only gave this restaurant a 3 out of 5 is because, in my experience, service here is really hit or miss. One day I'll get an amazing server that's kind and friendly, and the next day I'll be waiting for 10 minutes to be seated (when the restaurant is practically empty). Otherwise, they have a solid all day breakfast menu and after renovations, a nice and bright interior. Will probably come again for an early breakfast.\n",
      "Markham station is a classic breakfast place. It's kid friendly with activities and crayons. The breakfast is good, however my complaint is that they need more variety with their pancakes - for example, chocolate chip pancakes, or blueberry pancakes. Friendly service staff.\n",
      "My family and I shared a breakfast wrap with home fries ($8.99) and a Greek salad which came with garlic bread ($10?). The wrap was pretty good but basic, it had eggs, bacon, shredded cheese. There were plenty of Homefries which were good as well, not too oily, I believe they were baked not fried. The Greek salad was a large portion and the dressing was very fresh tasting. The coffee was better than I thought it would be, $2.50 I think with free refills. The service was quick and friendly (came at around 3pm weekday though), decor was modern, tables and washrooms were clean.\n",
      "The food is great and affordable but the servers are so rude. I would enjoy eating at this place more If i got better service.\n",
      "This place is horrible the little Indian man at the cashier has no type of customer service skills he ignores you and gives you attitude once you've paid lol they show a regular size McDonald's cup drink in the picture and give you a small Dixie cup once you've cashed out we didn't even want the combo!! talk about bamboozled . My man liked the burger but I think it all looked shit every time I ate a French frie I got sadder sadder . The gravey was disgusting as well and was like salty sorta tasted like curry yuck ....this place should be scheduled for demolition cause I give it a -0\n",
      "The only good thing about this place is the music and memories I've had here. This used to be the only breakfast restaurant I knew of that was open 24 hours until I came along a more affordable, better-tasting one called Honey B Hive. Only come to Markham Station if you have a lot of time to waste. The food takes forever and the staff are not attentive at all. Even getting a table takes long when it is not busy. The food is a bit overpriced but it is not bad. The only thing that ticked me off the last time I came here was this one waitress who had no adequate manners whatsoever and just reached for my baby, touching her face and who knows where else before we could even say anything. Mind you, she has quite intense allergies that the waitress could have easily had contact to. When we said something the second time she did it, she didn't apologize and just stomped off. By the way, we asked to switch waiters but they told us it's by section so we just let it go and ate quickly so we could leave. It is extremely rude to touch someone without their permission especially if that person doesn't have a voice of their own yet and obviously would not like strangers touching them in any way just as we would not enjoy strangers touching us. Markham Station is unprofessional in general (their other waiters aren't much better - they are usually talking loudly amongst themselves instead of noticing customers calling for their attention), but after this experience, I don't think I will ever come back.\n",
      "Actually isn't that bad, you can get a very decent breakfast even when you are a criminal on the run as the place looks to be full the then after hours. Thats just a joke but the whole plaza if full of Scarborough stereotypes which in small doses can be kind of fun. Check this place out if you have never been.\n",
      "Expensive ! Just don't buy any overly priced drinks. Below average service. Unless they change, no second time.\n",
      "Always good food. Standard fare. Quick service. Ask for Natasha, she's the sweetest lady to serve you. They have brekky specials so take advantage! 24h service!\n",
      "I truly believe that Markham Station is a Scarborough gem. Most of the people I've met who are from Scarborough has heard of Markham Station. Food truly brings people together I went by again not too long ago and was really surprised at the change of decor! They have renovated their interior to a more classy modern feel compared to their previous decor which gave the impression of an old-school diner. But I really really like the new decor and am happy this place is upgrading because I would be sad if Markham Station ever closes down. Before 10 or 11AM, they have a $6 breakfast special that always fills me up and leaves me satisfied. It comes with the same ol' breakfast deal anywhere - 3 eggs, choice of sausage, ham or bacon, with home fries (you can switch this I believe) and choice of toast. Service was good, she was attentive to our water and asked us if the food and everything was alright. I do really like the homefries here, probably 2nd to Panagio's. The booths were really comfy and I like how everything seems sparkly and new. At Markham Station, there is also a take-out area which you can go in, order and there are a few seats available for you to eat your takeout in there as well. The take-out area has a seperate entrance from the dining area. They also have a bar area which closes around 1-2AM, I believe. Markham Station is also 24 hours, so sometimes I'll come by for a late night snack... heehee. For those who haven't been to Markham Station, I really recommend that you do!\n",
      "So, if you're from Scarborough, you know about Markham Station. The location has done a number of upgrades with their decor and their food. The decor makes the place look much more modern. It was apparently done in August 2016 (this year) so it looks all clean and nice. The staff is usually as friendly unless you get them during the club rush at 3am. The food looks like it was upgraded in certain areas as well. My friend got the Steak and Eggs, and it looked good. The Fish and Chips I had looked like a step up as well. HOWEVER, it tasted similar to how it has been for years. Its decent, and can hit the spot when you're hungry (its 24 hours). But not a place to go out of your way for. I give it an A-OK since I have been going here for many many years. It is infamous in Scarboruogh for the years of fights that used to occur there. We can all tell stories about this place. Cops would always be there eating/coffee as a deterrent. Upgrades may be good, but it is to soon to determine it it should rank higher. But it is a staple of the east end, especially if you grew up on these streets.\n",
      "OK not fine dining, on my first visit ...food was tasty & service was quick. The waitress on in the afternoon was very considerate & helped us to pick from the huge menu and in accommodating food allergies.\n",
      "Horrible food. Horrible service. Two thumbs down. Will never go here again. The food was greasy, bland, and disgusting. How do they screw up eggs and toast? The waitress was extremely rude. She told us to hurry up and leave because her shift was ending. When I brought my complaint to the manager, he didn't care and was outright rude. If that's how they think they'll keep customers then keep it up. I will never go to this place again and I tell everyone I know to stay away. I hope they go out of business so that others won't have to be subjected to their garbage food and garbage attitude. They don't even deserve one star but there's no option for zero.\n",
      "This place is amazing after its renovations! Service is nice and friendly and the food seemed to have improved a lot after it being renovated it's no more greasy but they have options between roasted potatoes, rice, and regular fries with every breakfast special. I've been coming here regularly after it's renovations! Keep up the good work!\n",
      "Sitting down with food in front of me in under 10 mins!!! And that's where it ends...I needed a quick breakfast and was in the area so I stopped in. It's nothing special; I can make this at home. It was quick & cheap & not McDonalds.\n",
      "Me and my bf came here on a Sunday evening. Ordered souvlaki and baby back ribs. My souvlaki was tasty with a lot of rice and salad on the side. However bf said his ribs were kinda dry. Service was good. Our server was friendly. I did notice it took a long time for her to take the order for the couple sitting next to us. She was apologetic though. Decent diner food. I may come back when I am around but probably won't go out of my way to eat here.\n",
      "Came here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast... 2nd time around and i have to say i should have paid the extra money and went to coras. I got the western omelette and it was dry, their hash brown was dry. Its a sad meal when ketchup cant even save the meal. 20cents for jam... I couldn't even enjoy jam on my white toast that i didn't get asked whether i wanted white or brown. Oh yes and i felt bad for my friend as i started to realize that the server instead of asking for help stacked my plate on top of hers. So i got some steak sauce on the side of my plate. Not a place ill be coming back again.\n",
      "I really like this place! I have been going to Markham Station for years, I love the breakfast especially because they serve it all day! The service is fast and by now I know most of the staff by name. I recommend this please highly.\n",
      "One of my fav's, this place is open 24hrs w/ breakfast! Service is awesome and quick! Food rocks! It's really cool!\n",
      "Use to be good, used to be my favourite. Now...forget it. The servers are rude and the food is disgusting.\n",
      "I haven't been here for years, but it's nice to see this place is still opened For business....only because it's opened 24hrs. The place is spacious, always opened, serves all day breakfast and comfort diner foods. From fish n chips, burgers n fries to souvlaki, soups and sandwiches. Their prices are very reasonable and the portions are always satisfying....... However....yes however, their credibility for freshness was uncertain. My bro and I came here Saturday afternoon for lunch, while he had the pork souvlaki dinner, I ordered their one of their favorites, quiche Lorraine and Cesar salad. At $12.99 the price was reasonable, however when my dish arrived parts of the outer crusts of my quiche had fallen off. At that point my first thought was damn! It must be frozen, and at first bite I was correct, though warm, it was spongy and soggy inside. The salad was great, and when I questioned my waitress about the quiche she advised it they make their quiche ahead of time and store them in the freezer........ yup...I think next time I'll have to opt for a less fancier and more diner - diner dive type of meal lol. Service was friendly and efficient. ...but still a disappointment.\n",
      "Went here after a night out on the town with a group of friends. Having been to similar breakfast / diner type places, I can't say that I was overly impressed with the food here. I ordered the cajun burger, which game with fries, and was ok -- it satisfied my hunger pangs without stuffing me, but really wasn't anything to rave about. I may end up back here to meet up with friends after hours, but it wouldn't be my choice of venue.\n",
      "The Markham Station is the best place to go for breakfast or pretty much anything. The people who work there are so amazingly friendly and kind\n",
      "I went there multiple times. Every time its a disappointment and i can say this is the least disappointing visit so far . Food is outdated and tastes weird. Their fries, bread, and eggs always taste old,dry,and bland. Not the best service too.\n",
      "Went on a Monday morning, and again on Thursday morning. Both times, decent food, especially the breakfast special. However both times also horrid waiters--different waiters, but learned from the same school of rudeness--let us stand at the front about 5 minutes while chatting with other employees, then grunted and pointed to a table for us to go to. Both times the forks were dirty (spoons and knives OK) and we had to ask the waiter to sweep the crumbs off the seats. We noticed the waitresses were friendly and efficient, but the waiters were the opposite. We had to go get the waiter to get coffee refills. Washrooms were tiny and filthy; no TP in the men's. The first time we tipped as usual, assuming the waiter just had a bad day. The second time we gave our tip to one of the waitresses who noticed we needed more coffee even though it wasn't her table. The roasted potatoes were really good, but the home fries were very dry and tasted like they were over baked frozen potatoes.\n",
      "This place is much nicer after the upgrades. The staff have always been friendly and the food is pretty decent. It's open 24 hours which is great when you get the late night menchies. Oh yeah their fries tastes like McDonald's but no complaints here.\n",
      "I came here to appease my family when they suggested this place a day for breakfast. After my last experiences i was determined to avoid this place. Edible enough food with spotty service on weekends. Basically Your staple breakfast foods (eggs, homefries, sausage, toast and coffee). My one major peeve is the lack of quicker service on my past 2 visits this year. Moreover the quality of service. The coffee comes with free refills, when I was a kid I recall the servers coming by frequently. I had to flag the servers down multiple times for this. The servers are polite, but I guess it's difficult to manage on busier days? I come here, think of my childhood, come With my parents. I guess it's tradition, but I remember it being way way better. But I think it's time I convince my brother to love Eggsmart more than this place.\n",
      "Food is okay but man it felt like I took off 5 years off my life after eating the onion rings. The batter was thick and soaked in oil. I rather they have less batter and be sliced then so they are more crispy. These were like super huge onion rings. The burger is on par with Harvey's but I think Harvey's burgers are a bit more juicy and thick. I got the banquet burger and it came with cheese and bacon. For about $5 its not bad but found the bacon to be a bit tough and hard like its been sitting for a while. The decor is really old school. It looks like the original signs for the menu were the original ones used from when they first opened and it looks like something from the 80's. Will I be back? Probably not since Harvey's is right across the street but may consider to try their breakfast if I'm really desperate.\n",
      "Man if you come for their breakfast specials from 6am to 11am for 5.99 this place is definitely a 5*. Their food is good and where else can you get so much breakfast food for only 5.99??? I believe it comes with 3 eggs 3 sausages 3 bacon, home fries and toast. I've never made it up for that but I have come here for brunch a bunch of times and the food is really great normally as well. I'm surprised at the low rating since this place is huge and seems to always have a very decent amount of people dining in it at any time in the day. Actually maybe it's because most of it is old people and they don't use Yelp.. Only thing is sometimes I crave peanut butter and they don't carry it. But whatever. Also, the servers are generally quite nice too.\n",
      "What can I say. Markham station is alright. They seem to be more charming/the food tastes better during those twilight hours, and I've heard service doesn't suck as bad as it does during the daylight. Yes, it IS because your ham showed... I usually go for their souvlaki - which is overpriced, 14.99 for pork and a whopping 17.99 for chicken. Yikes. But, you do get a fair amount of food, and the skewers of meat are quite nicely broiled and charred. I got the pork just yesterday and was quite satisfied - it comes with generously dressed Greek salad, a serving of rice, a really good amount of tzatziki and their fabulous marinated potatoes, the pork was also flavorful and a delight to eat. Their menu says \"30 minute seating limit\" in fine print (lulz WHAT?) For $2.39 you only get one free refill with your coffee (Really?) Their orange juice is basically puddle water. And their service is shitty, slow and sub-par. Figures because Scarborough is wasteland.\n",
      "Lovely server, awful food. Came Thursday afternoon, so place wasn't busy. Ordered eggs with home fries, toast, and sausage. Came out incredibly quickly but the food was cold. Got the server to take it back but again it came out quickly and clearly the food had just been reheated - I could see where I had eaten from and the pepper I had added. Maybe we needed to specify we wanted fresh food?? Lost my appetite. Never returning.\n",
      "It's been a few years since I've eaten here, but first time since they've renovated. There's lots of choice here so there shouldn't be any problem finding something to eat. Came here at 12:30pm on a Saturday and was able to get a seat right away. Ordered the eggs (sunny side up) with sausages and home fries. Toast is deliciously buttered, but today the home fries weren't as crispy as I'd like them to be. If you want all day breakfast, you can't go wrong with this place. To get the best value, make sure you get there before 11am. The service is lacking though as we had empty glasses for quite a while. When I asked for more water, they only gave us one glass. And left the other glasses empty. 4/5 for food and value 2/5 for service\n",
      "Susan helped us sell our home. She is a very good communicator and stays on top of all the tasks that are required. We never worried about any part of the process because she had everything under control. She is very pro-active and worked the listing and did not just sit on it. She and her husband are a very good team. He held several open houses for us. Susan is very hard working and does a great job of making sure the house is priced right which is the key to actually selling the home.\n",
      "We met the Miller team through a family member who knew we were selling our house. From the beginning Susan was fantastic. She listened to what we were wanting to sell our house for. She examined what it would take to get the best offer. Susan has a great team with her and she uses them all. Within a few days we had another person come out and go through every room, closet, pantry, and bathroom and gave us a list of things that we could do to make the house more appealing to buyers. We were given the freedom to pick and choose which items we wanted to do as well as given an order of importance so we knew where to focus. We took the list and after accomplishing what we needed to we were on the market. After having some interest and getting feedback we decided to do a couple of more upgrades and then the house was perfect. In the end we got a full asking price offer and we couldn't have been happier!! Throughout the process Susan never made us feel like we wouldn't sell the house even when we would get discouraged. We would contact her often and never felt like we were bugging her. She is a fantastic realtor and we would definitely use her again and recommend her and her team to anyone who is buying or selling their home.\n",
      "Susan and her team did a wonderful job selling my mother-in-laws home. My mother-in-law is 87 years old and had lived her home for 27 years. She was very sensitive to her making this big decision in her life. In my opinion she went above and beyond her duties assisting us with refreshing her home and getting it ready to sell. Once we put in on the market it sold within two weeks and at a higher sale price than we anticipated. We appreciate her professional and personal approach to what can be a challenging process. My wife and I whole heartily recommend her services. Thank you.\n",
      "This is my fifth home purchase, and I must add my most memorable. I met Susan Keller a few years ago at a function at the Islands, the development I was living at for the past 10 years. My wife and I wanted to eliminate the endless stair climbing in our current home; so we decided on calling on Susan and the Miller team. Being a Native New Yorker I was a cynic and my past dealings with realty companies were not always pleasant. Susan listened to our ideas and came up with a plan of action to sell my current home. Susan is not pushy, she suggested a professional decorator to show our home in its best light, at her expense. The other half of the Miller Team is Grant, Susan's husband. We told him we wanted to live closer to our daughter and our grandchildren. We told him the price range we could afford and the specifics that we wanted. Damn, he did such a great job that we BOUGHT the house before we sold ours. I believed this was going to be a challenge, Susan saw it a different way. We went over budgets, expectations, things to do to make our home more desirable than those around us. Most of all she was confident our home would sell in a reasonable period. The price was set, and listed on MLS on Monday and we were in contract by Friday of the same week. During this period my wife and I were preparing for the closing on the home we bought in San Tan Valley, Grant covered all the details, inspection, appraisal, things that I dreaded doing back in New York.Grant went the extra yards to reassure us all will go well. I am thrilled to report the MILLER TEAM are the the team with integrity, caring, and most of all compassion. We closed on both home within one month of each other. Thanks to Susan and Grant, a very nerve racking event turned out to be the most memorable home I ever purchased.\n",
      "Love, love, LOVE Jenn and Red Balloon. I even created some Red Balloon cards after taking her social media kick-start class to jump-start my handprinted, eco-friendly line of goods at www.bestinshore.com. I specialize in gifts that give back to animal rescue, and I met a LOT of people who were doing things in nonprofits + art through her network. She's always available after her classes for questions, and is patient and up to date on marketing trends. Definitely worth the money!\n",
      "I love working with Jenn! Red Balloon's newsletter is one of the few of my subscriptions that I immediately scan for relevant, heart-centered, useful tips and information. Having been a past client of Jennifer's, I can say she helped me understand marketing methods to get my business launched in a way that reached the right clients and with the right message. Jennifer - inside and out - is a legitimate force and with Red Balloon services, has tremendous to offer entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n",
      "Working with Jenn Maggiore and her team to re-brand my business was an absolute delight. From the first time we met at her offices to my most recent email pleading for help with a web issue, Jenn has always been quick to reply, diligent and thorough. The presentation of support materials was excellent. She is personally charming and energetic and very enthusiastic about helping others succeed. This was money well spent and I highly recommend Red Balloon to others looking to grow their business.\n",
      "If you really hate Thanksgiving, you could just go to Sheetz for your food and not have to talk to anyone all day long. I wish more places had touch-screen order things.\n",
      "I asked for a croissant and they gave me a pretzel bun. They have knock off sweetners for Equal and Sweet N Low that just say sweetener the don't' say that they are no calorie sweetners so I didn't know if they were sugar or what. The electronic order system is confusing unless you want one of the few things on the main screen. I just wanted an espresso, I looked through all the menus for a few minutes to try and find it, after that I just asked the lady for help.\n",
      "I live about 5 minutes from here and I love everything about Sheetz, 24 hour food, a wide selection of made to order food. I advise pick something after a fun night of drinking, the pizza tastes great then :)\n",
      "I'm from Minnesota so we don't have a Sheetz but my boyfriend is from Ohio so we always drive by this on our way back home to MN. I was amazed that you can order your (specifically designed) burger from a screen and it's made exactly how you ordered it. I loved it!!!\n",
      "This is Gold's!!! Everyone has the same focus...To workout not gossip or bother someone during thier workout!!!\n",
      "Love the staff and instructors! People are nice and don't laugh @ you if you are a first timer in a class!\n",
      "Was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. I have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! I think im gonna save the money and work out for free at Nellis AFB and just make the drive over there instead.\n",
      "Worst personal training ever. Trainers are very unprofessional! I went through 3 trainers in 2 months because they kept leaving and never told me. The one in charge did not seem concerned or even tried to help me get a new a trainer. The Gym is gross; machines don't looked like they are washed, floor is covered in dirt and hair, and bathrooms are nasty. Machines are always broken or in repair. Don't go to the losse gym it isn't worth your money. Military it's worth it to go to the base gym and spend the money on gas.\n",
      "OOOOHHHHH man.... only getting worse. The staff are circling the drain while the new gym members are getting younger and younger. Yea, cool, have kids understand fitness instead of sitting on the couch, but most of the equipment these kids don't need to be around.... so if you want to teach kids fitness, why not have a class or designated area for them instead of random kids everywhere. If I had to go and find a decent human being working at this location to talk to about every single thing that was wrong in this gym, I'd be $hit outta luck, not to mention I'm not doing the job of 25+ people, if no one can handle working at the gym, I'm sure there is some other 15 year old that can stand at the front desk and play on their cell phones all night.\n",
      "I absolutely love this gym. The staff is always friendly! It's always really clean in here! The trainers are very knowledgable and have a genuine concern for all of their clients. I am a fan of the \"No towel, no workout\". I wish there was a full basketball gym but still very accommodating. I love the cardio theater is amazing! Very great experience for those who need a little distraction while their running. Check this place out!\n",
      "THEY CHARGED ME OVER $150 FOR 3 MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP, APPLICATION FEES, AND CENCELLATION FEES WHEN i NEVER RECIVED A FRICKEN MEMBERSHIP CARD. So basically i was never a member and NEVER used the gym! This review is also going to the BBB, Facebook, twitter, instagram, Gold's Gym corporate CEO and referencing the Fair Credit Billing Act per the Federal Trade Commision for undelived service or goods. If you want to be cheated and scammed out of your money for trying to be a member, apply for membership.\n",
      "Love it! the classes are so much fun and you dont even feel like you are workig out!! great atmosphere! REALLY busy from 4 to 8... that's why I go at 530 am! lol\n",
      "Love it way more than 24! Personally, I have never had a rude experience with any staff in the 2 mths. I've Been there, but I go to workout not make bff's!\n",
      "Clean, fresh gym. I will drive the extra two miles to this gym versus the one I signed up at because it's just so refreshing. It has a great variety of classes to choose from, wow so many that sometimes I debate which I want to take. The staff is very friendly and the weight and cable machines are well taken care of, they seem new. When it comes to yoga Kieta is my favorite instructor, she just flows.\n",
      "I should have headed the warnings about Golds billing practices. Golds policy is to charge a \"rate lock fee\" after you have been a member for 120 days. I canceled my membership per their 31 day notice policy, at less than 120 of total membership. They still billed my account the $39 rate lock fee. I disputed the charge and they told me I have to cancel within 60 days in order for my membership to expire before 120 days. That is not what the contract that I signed states. It clearly states must provide 31 day notice within 120 days to avoid rate lock fee. This is why Golds is losing business and has gone from \"the\" gym to empty parking lots. I highly recommend NOT JOINING.\n",
      "Great gym. Has everything you need plus more. Staff is super friendly. Plus they got a cardio theater, that shit is baller. If you complain about how packed the gym is at certain times, hand stamps, and an occasional faulty machine then go do crossfit.\n",
      "This isn't going to be a long review...just wanted to say the service at this golds gym is awesome! I went with a friend as a guest and signed up on my next visit! Also, the pool is open 24/7, so I can get my cardio in without running :)\n",
      "I really like the equipment and facility but it is very expensive. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really wish it was more affordable.\n",
      "If I could give them 0 stars I would! Screw this gym, they only want your money. No wonder they have over 584 complaints on Consumer Affairs! Extremely upset and appalled at their unprofessional customer service. They don't send out notices or let their clients know when their contract/year mark is coming up. I wasn't even aware until I checked my bank statement and received a charge for $59.95. I called the gym to find out what was going on. They said my year contract was up and I was being charged $39 for the annual fee. Since when was my contract up? I then asked why no notice was sent notifying me that my contract was coming to an end. The girl on the phone paused for a moment, then said \"in the contract you signed, I'm sure you read the part about the annual fee\". .... How does that answer my question? Why don't you send out notices to your clients keeping them informed of this?! I asked to get the charge reversed and my membership canceled. They said they couldn't do that and gave me the Member Services phone number. I called them, and they gave me the same BS scripted response. \"The contract you signed stated an annual fee\". Sigh. I'm so irritated at the lack of comprehension these employees have. No one seems to comprehend that I am asking why no letter or notice was sent to the client. I understand the annual fee. Had I known it was coming up, I would've canceled once my contract was up. Needless to say, I'm out, just canceled! Packed gym, not enough equipment, plus this experience makes being a member here not worth it. Once the new LVAC opens, I'm headed back there. Gold's Gym is a joke. They may have the $59.95, but they've lost a client and I'll make sure to direct anyone who asks to any gym but this one. TIP: Write the date of your annual fee on a calendar, or put it into your phone so YOU are aware of the renewal date since they don't notify you.\n",
      "Ahhhh finally the answer to the age old question: Where are all the hot guys in Las Vegas?! The Answer: Gold's Gym And ladies they are quiet, & lifting heavy things. The way God intended it. Whoever created Gold's gym is a genius!! It is two stories, cardio machines upstairs, and weights downstairs. Ladies do you know what this means?!!! It means you get beautiful balcony seats to the gun show!! Picture this: you get on the treadmill, you look down and find a beautiful man coming out of the locker room. He is tall, he is fine, he has his own theme music, he is porn in slow motion. You're staring at him, he's staring at his guns, he has no idea you're being a creeper, and by the time you have mentally planned out your wedding you've already done 4 miles! I won't even tell you how much weight I've lost since I became a member!! Staff & Atmosphere: Have you ever opened the door to a gym and been slapped in the face by funk? Completely NOT the case at Gold's!!! It is soo clean! I love it! Everyone keeps to themselves (seriously, you can leave your pepper spray in the car), staff is helpful and friendly, they have an amazing cardio theater, pool, sauna, jacuzzi, tanning booths, blah blah blah go see the hot guys!!\n",
      "Never been to a golds gym before, always been 24 hour fitness. But since this one is right around the corner and there are no 24 hours in my area, I decided to check it out. Once I walked in I realized there was no difference from what I'm used too. Really big gym, has basketball courts, pool, the works! I sat down with a manager to discuss rates and for $10 down I'm in for $20 a month! And I can bring a friend every single day for free. This is huge for me and my girlfriend. Looking forward to coming to this gym a lot! -Joe\n",
      "Just moved from Chicago Suburbs, I was looking for a complete fitness center which offers a variety of classes and personal training. Living in N. Vegas, it was hard to find something close enough, much less with those requirements, plus reasonable monthly rates. Well, believe it or not, a different brand club manager referred me to check out Gold's on Losee. Immediately upon meeting membership staff, Blake S. and provided with the most pumped up tour I have ever had in my 40-something years in clubs, I was sold this would be my new home! Not only does Gold's work with your total fitness regime, however, they provide nutrition guidance. Blake's through tour and patience in answering all my questions, were the highlight of my day! (My last membership was with LA Fitness, so I know the questions to ask). Anyway, I can't wait to take my first class tomorrow, so I just may have to go tonite!\n",
      "I used to be a 24 Hour Fitness girl until this location opened. It's newer and super close to home. I can seriously run from home to here and back as my cardio but there's that thought that what if I drop weights on my foot, then how will I get home? It's clean and pretty well-maintained. Their check-in process is efficient since they have your picture on file and they'll ask you simple questions if you forgot to bring your membership card. There's a basketball court, cardio cinema and weights area on the first floor; exercise class rooms and more cardio equipments on the second floor. What's funny to me is that there are rules against poor hygiene and loud/obnoxious noises written on their contract. I'm a germaphobe + dudes grunting while lifting 20lbs or those who leave machines/mats warm and sweaty bother me. I can say there are still some members that are like that but not as bad as the other gyms I've been to. They will check if you're carrying a towel when you come in, yay! It's open 24 hours/day and they have classes as early as 5:30am up to 7:30pm so I can join classes before and after work. I've attended Body Pump, Body Combat and Spin - fun stuff! Excellent instructors. I had the coolest trainer that helped me reach my goal but he left so no more training sesh for me. The only gripe I can think of would be the one front desk girl on a Sunday morning who looks like she needs vitamins and some sleep or coffee. But other than that, I think everyone that works here are lively and helpful.\n",
      "This gym is terrible. I have a membership here and at LVAC and I am just waiting until the new LVAC opens on Decatur and the 2-15 to cancel my membership at Gold's because this place is a joke. There are only 5 Stair Master machines and at least one is always broken. The others are hardly functional and can't seem to keep a steady pace. Honestly, I think that might be a safety hazard in itself. I've mentioned it to the desk and they're still not working properly. On top of that, it seems like a new machine is out of commission downstairs every day as well. I can never seem to get in a complete workout because something I want to use ALWAYS happens to be broken. Also, the selection of machines as well as the quality of the machines here is deplorable. This membership costs me more monthly than LVAC ever has and I am 100% unsatisfied. Counting the minutes until the new LVAC opens.\n",
      "well my wife and i have definitely been to way better gyms but....this is where we live now very close to here and its convenient and its got a pool for me too swim......but the staff are always preoccupied and seem so upset when you ask them for something like you just asked a stranger for 10000000 dollars.....its pretty annoying...as far as the facility its very nice pretty clean and impressive with how much equipment they have available.....but its still not enough for how many people show up there from about 4pm -8pm....its just a serious pain to get a machine at that time....\n",
      "The child care area appears clean and spacious. Verda is great with our kids. Great gym overall. Having a safe and clean child care is a big plus and why we wil continue to work out at Gold's.\n",
      "Ok, so I may have jinxed myself when I said I had no customer service issues in my previous review. When I first started going to this gym I was told I could use the same locker and keep my stuff it just make sure I had a lock on it and it would be fine. I was not able to go to the gym for a couple of weeks and when I returned to the gym I noticed my lock was gone. I went to the front desk and the clerk tells me that the manager had them go in and clear out all of the lockers and he could not find my stuff and they threw a lot of stuff out, which I was a little irritated about but it was just a pair of shoes I needed to replace anyways and a few other things. However the guy at the front desk just didnt seem to care that my stuff was thrown out. About a month has passed and I then get a call from a rude collections lady saying I owe all this money for not paying for my personal trainer (I had inquired about personal training previously) I attempted to tell the lady from collections that the lady I spoke with about personal training told me that to hold the price I just needed to sign the paperwork so she could get me in the system but me paying the amount due is what locks me into the contract but I had to pay within the next couple of days, I decided not to do the personal training and even told the lady I did the paperwork with I was not going to do it. The lady from collections told me that I had to talk to the manager about it. I called and spoke with the manager of this location and he told me he would look into it and contact me back. This was about a month and a half ago, I have called him and left several messages and he is always\"in a meeting\" How are you supposed to manage your store if you are in meetings all day every day. I even purposely called every hour one day and of course he was busy each time I called. I like the gym and the staff for the most part if you have an issue you better hope you do not have to speak with the manager because apparently he is not there for the customers he is there for the meetings and his lunch breaks.\n",
      "I have to admit I didn't want to sign up with Golds Gym. It was a preconceived notion that I would be surrounded by guys on roids and women dressed up like they are going to the club afterwards. I've always been a 24 hour fitness gal and never wanted to look else where. This place has a low monthly rate and no contract plus it's a quick jaunt from my place in Aliante. I actually live really close to the other location on Centennial but that one is way too small for my liking. This gym is clean, pretty well ventilated and I never had a issue not being able to use the equipment I wanted. I only been to the yoga classes but the others look pretty popular since most times I take a peek inside it's pretty packed. My little one goes to the Child Care Center here and even though I love the one at 24 Fitness way better this one isn't bad. There are more people on staff here to watch over the little ones and they do require you to make a appointment to bring in your little nugget so it's not over crowded. My little girl had taken a position that she no longer likes going to the child care area and the workers there are very kind and helpful to coax her to stay. Overall I would and have recommended this gym :-)\n",
      "I must say I was impressed with this location. Not only was the gym really nice, the customer service given was very welcoming. I signed up with Korbin and he presented everything very professionally. I work in the medical field and I really take pride in the way I provide customer service to my patients. I feel today people lack knowledge in the meaning of customer service and how important it is because that is really what brings people back. I signed up for a personal trainer as well so I will have to say that Caesar was great in helping me with that. I was also able to meet my trainer Josh, which I must say I am looking forward to training with him. He seemed very energetic and he had a great aura about him. Crossing my fingers that the first impression the staff provided me, is one that will continue on. :)\n",
      "I enjoy this gym allot. Everyone is very nice. The daycare staff is also very wonderful. I really enjoy the instructors for the classes as well. It's also very clean.\n",
      "I like Gold's Gym because it's affordable, many locations, and has the most newest equipment. Should I mention they also have a movie theater? Well they do...a cardio theater is not bad because time flies while your getting your cardio on while watching a movie. They also offer many different classes which I love since I do get bored doing the same routines, so why not sweat while busting a move in Zumba class. However, the gym can get packed within 5 pm to 8 pm on week days. I don't know if people just go there to hang out or if they are actually working out since I've seen some people just talk in front of the machines. Overall, I like this gym and recommend it. The staff is friendly and the gym seems to be always cleaned. The child care is a great size, but can get full so make sure you reserve a spot for your little one.\n",
      "The Losee location of Golds Gym is amazing. Everything from swimming pool to a basketball court. Fitness classes such as Zumba and MMA are available to your disposal. The staff is very friendly and energetic and the personal trainers are fun to work with to help you reach your ideal body state. If you call Shannon Harris at the Aliante & Centennial location (10 minutes from Centennial and Losee) at 702-396-0800, he'll hook you up with a Golds Gym membership for $0 down, 1st month free, $20 per/mo. after. Call now to make your appointment\n",
      "I've been working out here since the summer and I must say I'm a HUGE fan of the cardio cinema! No matter what time of day I go, I can find a machine, watch a movie, and get my cardio on. This place is so clean, too. The locker room is always being mopped and wiped and I've also seen the cleaning gal dusting the workout areas and machines. The child care workers really seem to enjoy what they're doing, and greet my child by name. I've never taken any classes because I'm too embarrassed to trip over my own feet, but I might give Zumba a try. I've even thought of just sitting in the hot tub with a book!\n",
      "Victor the manager at the Gold's Gym in Las Vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. Victor the manager at the Gold's Gym in Las Vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. When Victor spoke to me he had a mouthful of food. I waited nearly 10 minutes to speak to someone. Victor told me that I needed to pay an extra $10.00 a month to use the tanning beds. I've been going to Gold's Gym for months, yet no one told me about this. In fact, when I signed up, the salesperson told me I wouldn't have to pay an additional money to use the facilities other than the day care and spin classes. That was a lie to get my membership.\n",
      "I toured the gym 9/2013, the facility and the equipment were everything you could want in a gym... I wanted to sign up for a year and pay in advance.... the salesman Fernando told me they can't take cash in advance?? it was like trying to by a car ... he went to his manager 3 times, in the end I walked out and went to Express fitness paid for a year in advance.... they let me walk because I wouldn't give them access to my credit card\n",
      "I would give 5 stars to this gym for the quality of their equipment and the facility but 2 stars to the service and staff. We have been to this gym almost 6 times to get rates and every time we are given a different rate, always way too high to be even close to affordable and higher than what most our friends are paying for this gym. Today we went again to get rates and as I told the guy that we have been given different rates he said that this is not true and their rates have not changed for months, but then as we said we would like more time to think about it, he said, as you know our rates change weekly.... WHAT? so he was very contradictory in his words, and still could not work something out for us... :((\n",
      "Okay...I have to admit. I wasn't a fan of this gym when I first stepped foot in here a couple of years ago. I had a quick workout back then and a lot of the machines, including cardio, were down. That was then, this is now. Either management changed or this Gold's stepped it up. I recently became a member just to change things up. Plus, this location is a hop, skip, and a jump away from my house. When it comes to me reviewing a gym, I look at cleanliness, equipment, and ambiance. Here are my thoughts so far; Cardio: Located upstairs and plenty of it. You have multiple flat screens to past the time. Even better, this gym has a cardio theater, which can be perfect for Low Intensity Steady State Cardio. Located upstairs is also their classes, TRX area, and spin classes. Machines: A mix of Life Fitness Machines and Hammer Strength. I'm not the biggest fan of Life Fitness Equipment. The only exceptions are their leg machines. But I am a fan of Hammer Strength and there's a ton of it. Free-Weights: Enough benches, power racks, and weights. A great addition to their free-weights is their squat bar, corner rows, and even a deadlift/shrug contraption. My only issue with their free weights is their lack of dumbbells between 10 lbs and 35 lbs. Either these lbs are nonexistent or they're lying around somewhere in the gym. There's still a ton of the monster DB's though Rest Rooms: Only reviewing the men's, lol. Huge locker room with a lounge to decompress, maybe watch some TV. Tanning Rooms: For additional charge, you can tan here. Not for me, but just throwing it out there. The staff here is excellent. Cesar knows his stuff and gave me advice on my membership without trying to push for commission. The gym is also clean and this time around, their equipment is all in great working order. PS: Like all other gyms, this one gets busy. I drive by here often and notice the parking lot during the peak times is crazy. My suggestion, get in early or really late. Yeah Buddy!!!\n",
      "This gym is amazing I've been coming here for almost 2 years love it staff here is very friendly and very helpful as well .\n",
      "A well balanced gym. Not leaning towards lifters or cardio. The clientele is cool. Most everyone is serious about their workouts. Not a lot of talking. The machines are always broken (cardio and weight training) however some seem to be getting replaced. There is a nasty water spill in the men's bathroom that has been there for a while. It's starting to smell really bad. Over all, setup is nice. I frequent a 24 hr fitness on Craig that I like a lot more. I use this golds for a change of scenery from time to time. Why only 2stars?.... well... nothing pisses me off more than their shitty \"no Towel, no entry\" policy. Golds gym west Covina has free towel service for all its members and charges the same membership fees. I've never heard of this kind of policy. There are broken machines, water fountains that smell like mold, missing clips on benches, and a water spill that I need to hop over in order to get to the sauna every day... but you're more concerned with posting large agressive signs and turning your customers away because they didn't bring a towel. Yeah yeah... people should bring a towel to the gym, I get it. But sheesh.... turning people away? I've been to a lot of Golds Gyms. I respect the brand. I love the atmosphere and I know how awesome they can be. This one has fallen a little further from the tree.\n",
      "Very disappointed in this place. Has gotten ghetto and dirty. There was an altercation with 2 guys where it broke out into a big agreement And THE STAFF DID NOTHING. I talked to one of the guys and he said They didnt do anything because it wasn't their problem IT'S YOUR GYM! AVOID coming here. Too many little kids \"working out.\" Weights left all over. Ghetto ppl But it's now only 10 bucks to sign up So I shouldn't be surprised.\n",
      "I'm not sure why people are saying this gym has bad customer service, but I've been a member for over 2 years now and the staff have been nothing but kind and courteous. The manager is a good guy who my husband and I personally speak with when it comes to renewing our contracts, etc. The ladies in the child care center are great, and our 1 year old son doesn't mind playing while we are working out. The cardio cinema is great, and there's only been 3 times in the past 2+ years where a machine hasn't worked. It's a busy gym, so people do leave their weights out, but never in the middle of the floor. I have no complaints about the gym itself, but a con would be that it gets a little crazy from about 430-7pm.\n",
      "I originally transferred from 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann Rd, because I moved to the north side. I actually wish I never did. My top 3 complainants about this gym: 1. Teenagers are EVERYWHERE!!! Don't plan to get a good workout during the summer time when they are out of school. All they do is work out in groups of like 5 and sit on the equipment all day. 2. Equipment is terrible and old. Most of the Free Motion Machine equipment is either missing the proper attachment handles or rigged together in an unsafe manner. This is actually embarrassing, especially when the gym charges you a yearly monthly maintenance fee...what a joke. 3. The dirtiest locker room I've every experienced. If you like to change in a dirt locker room with trash all over the place, then this is the spot for you. Bottom line, if you can treat yourself, spend the extra money and go to 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann. Military, I would just go the Warrior Fitness Center on base...for real!\n",
      "Typical fitness facility. Missing some stuff, but has a lot of repeats of the main equipment. Decent Customer service. For the most part, everyone behind the counter is pretty inviting. I took off one star because it just isn't \"perfect\". It's still missing some types of equipment it could easily have. The second star I took off because this is such a busy gym. It is insane. From probably 4 pm all the way to 11 pm sometimes it can be packed in here. I've come in real late sometimes and still have to wait around to get to equipment. Plus during the busiest hours you have some groups of people doing circuit training taking up 4 or 5 pieces of equipment. To each their own on training, I'm not putting down circuit training, but doing it at the busiest time of day is .... not nice... I'll just say it's not nice so my review doesn't get taken down. It's just a very frustrating experience. There's nothing the gym can do about the people. Maybe ask the groups not to circuit train when the parking lot is so full you can hardly find a parking space, but aside from that... There isn't a whole lot the gym can do about the people there. The good customer service shows they are trying. This just isn't a good gym to go to if you are serious about training because you NEVER know when you are gonna walk in and have to change up your whole plan because every piece of equipment you need is gone. That said. The golds off of Lake Mead and the one in Henderson are great locations. Never seem to have any real trouble getting around in those.\n",
      "CAUTION!!! Do not sign a contract with Golds Gym!!! After my contract was over they still continued to charged my credit card. A month after my contract ended I got a new credit card because mine was stolen, I did not alert golds gym because my contract had already ended. Little did I know that they were still charging me every month after the contract ended. I got a call from a collection agency, when I called the manager at the gym to get some answers it took 3 days just to get a call back. Once I got a call back I was told that there was nothing they could do for me and I needed to just take it up with the collections person. I was told from the agency that I owed $229.00, I asked the gym manager what I was being charged for and she said 3 months of missed payments which would of only been $65.00. So how they came up with $229.00 I don't know. But I will never deal with Golds gym again and I send a caution to anyone thinking about it.\n",
      "They reinstated my membership after several discussions with different managers and \"higher-ups\"\n",
      "I have always been afraid to join a major chain gym. I have felt uncomfortable with all the \"hard bodies\" walking around at other gyms. I have never felt uncomfortable here. It's a huge gym with many machines to choose from. You never have to wait and the staff is very welcoming.\n",
      "The gym itself is nice but trying to cancel the membership is a NIGHTMARE. Read the fine print about cancelling before you sign up or you will continue to be billed, even after you TRY to cancel. They use a 3rd party for billing. If you call the # it says to email them. It took 2 weeks of constant emails to finally get someone to respond. My 1st email was within the 31 day required cancellation but they went off of the last email received and said I would still be charged an additional months fee.\n",
      "I love coming to this gym! They take care of my baby really well, he cries when I pick him up after my workouts. Lol\n",
      "The monthly price is wonderful, that being said they spend the rest of your membership trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. I tried to change my payment date and was told that the only way to do so was to cancel my membership, pay the cancellation fee and come back on the day of the month that I want my payment to be, re sign up and pay another \"annual fee\" of $39 even though I just paid that when I signed up three months before. Oh, and don't forget your towel. If you don't have one you have to buy one of theirs for a dollar, just another way that they grab at our wallets. I'm not even going to get into the pain that cancelling the membership is and the extra costs that they tack on. The cheap monthly cost isn't even worth it because the gym is always packed, even at 5am. I'm so happy that I'm finished with Gold's.\n",
      "I joined this gym in January with my fiancé. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie!! Sad to see this awesome gym go down hill so quickly.\n",
      "This place is kinda dirty, to be honest. The machines/equipment aren't well kept. Everything is coated with dust that settles on to the sweat/bodily fluids that get on the machines. The gym that I used to go to in the Bay Area (California), was probably older than this gym, but so much cleaner. Besides that, you pretty much have everything you need here to get where you want to be here to get the job done. There's also a swimming pool... But I wouldn't want to swim in there.\n",
      "Even in late night the place is full. There is too many people endless place to work out. they have To make this place bigger.\n",
      "I really like this gym. It's super clean and the staff is friendly. They have everything you'd need.. great locker room, pool, kid's care, a CINEMA and tons of classes. I do agree with someone who mentioned rates fluctuating. I spoke to three different people and got three different quotes. Try talking to DC.. he's pretty helpful and will work with you. Highly recommend this place. Probably the best gym I've ever been to.\n",
      "I walked in with a goal and Golds gym is going to help me every step of the way. The whole facility was clean and organize. The staff was very friendly and nice. A special thanks to Stephon for helping me with the gym tour and answering all my questions. The kids area was clean and very neat. I'm ready for this big journey with Gold's Gym. Thank you!!!\n",
      "Horrible misrepresentation of fees. I asked on the phone what ALL the fees would be and was only told $10 to join and $25 for the month. I would NEVER pay more than $25 a month. I go down to the gym and then get told there is an ANNUAL fee of $40. They are hiding the enrollment fee as an annual fee.\n",
      "Their location is kind of dirty, and there's never any room to do anything because they're overpopulated all the time. The girls at the front desk are usually pretty rude, and if they're not rude they're standing around not doing anything. The staff members over badger you to sign up for different promotions. I get texts almost weekly from them even when I've told them I wasn't interested. They lied to me about my payment plan, and now I'm under fees that I didn't originally agree to. When I confronted the guy I signed up with about it of course he had no clue what I was talking about. The member services people can't do anything to fix it. I am almost hesitant to even try to fix the issue because I know for a fact that they're going to lie their way out of it. I'm not the only person who's had problems with them about hidden fees or false information. I probably came into the gym twice and I'm turned off about how it's not ever kept up, and the customer service sucks. When I texted the kid I signed up with to get the cancelation number he said it was on the back of my membership card, which I never received. So then he tried to talk me out of canceling then almost seemed judgmental about me canceling in the first place. It took forever to get to the point and for him to hand over the phone number. I am not impressed what so ever with this gym. I would not come back to this gym again nor would I suggest them to any of my family or friends. Honestly if you want to be tricked into high rates I would suggest going to Golds Gym on Losee. They're good for it.\n",
      "I have been a member of this gym since it opened. I used to really like this gym, but am seriously considering switching to the new LVAC opening on Decatur and the 215. Every summer the A/C breaks down. Lately, the Cardio Theatre treadmills have been out of commission and the gym itself has been way too hot. I'm surprised they actually have the stair masters fixed correctly. They are often also out of paper towels and disinfectant spray. The ladies' restroom stalls can be very messy on Sunday's too. While before I would recommend this gym to anyone in the North Las Vegas area, I cannot say the same now.\n",
      "Gold's Gym is garbage now. They lowered their prices to $10 a month and now they are always packed. The equipment is never clean and the staff are tools. Now they are trying to nickel and dime people by making towels mandatory and charging for their towels. How about you clean your own machines?! I didn't sign up to be your janitor. At the very least, keep your bleach bottles full! LVAC is a way better gym. I can't wait for the new one to open on 215 and N. Decatur.\n",
      "So I just recently signed up to this gym about a week ago. The staff was very helpful. I'm not very good when it comes to working out because half of the time I have no clue what I was doing. Gus informed me about the offers they have with gym trainers and they take care of you! Stefon hooked me up with an awesome deal and now I'm excited as ever. If you guys are looking for a sincere staff that cares about fitness and your well being, awesome gym atmosphere, great classes and great equipments this place is it. They have tons of stuff, 2 stories and I only pay 20 bucks. I totally recommend this place!\n",
      "I'll always be a LVAC girl but this gym isn't too shabby. It's much better than the Golds on Centennial that's for sure. My friend has a membership here and he likes me to keep him company so I happily oblige. What stood out most to me was the Cardio Cinema. It actually feels like a movie theater. Ginormous screen and a pretty decent sound system. It's easy to lose a few hours in here if a good movie is showing. Twilight was on once and I'm pretty sure I ran six miles that night! Whoever thought of cardio cinema is a genius. There's two floors. Second floor is mainly treadmills, ellipticals, stair masters, bikes, and rooms for fitness classes. First floor is mainly what I like to call \"the dude section\". Weights galore, basketball court and the pool which always looks like it isn't getting much use. And is it just me or does anyone else think the front entrance area is a huge waste of square footage? Seems like they could've dialed back on the open concept and used that wide open space for more machines or something more useful. Similar to most gyms, it's pretty busy during the evenings and sadly that's usually the only time I can go. Personally, I've never had the problem of waiting for a machine so I can't complain but from what my boyfriend says the weight area can be a pain when it gets too crowded. More notable mentions, most gym goers seem to follow the rules as far as towels and wiping off equipment. There's a rest area in the locker room, equipped with lounge chairs and a tv which is a nice option to have after a long & hard work out session. Overall this gym could use some updating but there's no doubt it gets the job done. Every time I leave this gym I'm dripping sweat & in desperate need of a shower. Mission accomplished. 4 solid stars.\n",
      "We love this Golds gym it has always been really clean. I love how friendly and enthusiastic the instructors are. My husband just signed up because now you can sign up without signing a contract. The only problem I ever had was a girl at the front desk was really rude to my friend when I brought her with me to try it out, but other than that everyone else has been super friendly. If you are looking for a gym with a pool and great classes this is the gym for you :)\n",
      "This is the third Gold's that I've visited in the valley and the only one with a swimming pool, apparently. This location in BFE, aka, North Las Vegas, is the one closest to the b/f and I wanted to check it out at least once to see why it's so fancy. Fancy because it's not on the list of Gold's gyms that my $15.95 monthly membership allows me to attend; this location is more expensive. Why? Well, upon entering, it is obviously bigger than the locations at Buffalo and Eastern. It's two stories and looks more like the 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport gyms (Summerlin and Rainbow/Alta)-brighter and spacious. Plus, it has the pool, which is the only thing I did here when I worked out. The locker room is nicer than the other locales, also. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but I've heard it does get crazy on the weekdays and more traditional workout times. Too bad it's so far from me, but I'm sure I'll be back from time to time.\n",
      "Place deserves no stars! It's dirty! No one wipes down there machines the lack of care for place shows on worn beat up equipment! I joined for the theater sole reason! They never change the movies! Start them when it ends! Follow the schedule of movie that should be now playing! They are e treacly rude the just walk in and turn on lights for whatever reason! They shut it down at 945 not 10pm! They charge the SAME price as LVAC with zero services!\n",
      "My 12 oz sirloin was at least 4oz of fat. Gross. Pathetic, really. Also pathetic, someone from the kitchen delivered food to another patron. The patron asked a question, and the kitchen attendant answered the question while walking away, making zero eye contact. Poor product. Poor service.\n",
      "WOW. Walked in and waited for fifteen minutes and never got seated! ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Can't comprehend how that happens.\n",
      "I recently returned to have a lite dinner with my friend after a year plus hiatus, well let me say I should have returned sooner! The new menu is well worth any amount of waiting time. I've since returned (apx 4 days later) for lunch, and was also pleasantly surprised. The new menu provides diverse options from grilled salmon, shrimp Thai salad, to lamb and and more. All plated wonderfully to please the eye, and the flavors didn't disappoint.\n",
      "A consistent chain with a menu that leaves me with many options that takes me a moment or two to decide. There are so many that are colorful with veggies and so many that seem healthy. This pleases me very much. It was lunchtime and they have specials in which you can choose 2 from different categories for prices by category. My husband chose that option and had 1/2 a grilled club sandwich and a chicken Caesar salad and I had the crispy chicken salad. We were both satisfied with our choices and finished every bite. Service was good, quality of food was great, prices were fair.\n",
      "Not a big fan of big chains. But sometimes you gotta go with the flow. This Applebee's, in Penn Center, is crazy wicked busy for lunch during the week. And they are great at moving people through to get as much of our lunch money as possible. So that means service is great. I've only ever gotten salads here and they have always been flavorful and as presented in their commercials and menu. The fact that they openly support the men and women in the military is a plus for me and makes me want to support this chain a little more. Oh yes, and they also support the America's 911 MC ride. Thanks for that, too, Applebee's - I'll try and return the favor more often!\n",
      "Pretty typical Applebees. I would normally give three stars, but there was no wait and service was quick, so I'll round it up to four.\n",
      "How hard is it to get an order right? Is it possible to get a food order served on a plate commensurate in size to the food being plated? If you are notified that the food delivered is wrong, is it too much to expect an apology, and not hear \"I've never actually looked at the menu\" (sly look, wink, wink, nod nod...like it's some funny inside joke). There's a reason I've not been to an Applebee's for years...nice to see that some things just never change. The food was passable, my rack of ribs jammed onto a too small rectangular plate with broccoli and the wrong kind of fries (ordered the garlic fries, not plain), the waitress displayed not a care that the fries were wrong, and quite frankly I don't do lemme fix it - get it right the first time...that is your job. Corporate culture, staff training...fail.\n",
      "I've never been to a restaurant quite disorganized than this one. From the moment I arrived the wait staff seemed to be very flustered. A lot of complaining from the servers about how many people were in their placed in their sections and bickering. It's very distracting and obnoxious when customers are trying to eat. The service was very slow considering my drink order wasn't even taken for 10 minutes after I was seated. Food was average for this type of restaurant.The most distributing behavior was when the manager corrected a server on the floor. People were walking past and I even noticed it since I was sitting near the kitchen and heard every word. Very unprofessional. One would think you'd pull that person into a room but apparently that's not how this Applebee's works. Won't be returning.\n",
      "We had dinner at this location tonight. I was having a terrible time with anxiety when I came in for dinner this evening. Our server, Erica, made me feel instantly at ease. She offered happy hour drinks and appetizers while we waited for the rest of our group. My watermelon margarita was perfect. When our family arrived, we quickly got appetizers and drinks. Erica was great with our picky eating requests and with our seven year old boy. All of our food was great. We had a rare steak and and a well done steak on our order and both were perfect. That is impressive. Erica checked in a bunch of times to make sure we were ok. It was a great experience all around. We chose Applebees because we had gift cards, but now I certainly would chose it again.\n",
      "We have gone here often in the past , today's visit will be our last visit. The prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller and it seems the quality of the food is not as good. Four of us dined this evening, 3 ordering steaks that had no flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were bland as well. On top of all of that, we went early to beat the dinner rush and the service was HORRIBLE. We had to ask for silverware after the food came, our drinks were never refilled and the waitress never asked how anything was. Time to find a new go to place, because this one is DONE.\n",
      "Our first visit to this new Applebee's restaurant. First was disappointed that they do not use any apps for reservations. However in hindsight I don't think that they'll need it... Based on my first visit I doubt that they will be very busy. As always my first litmus test in my ordering a nice Guinness draft... Nope ... Not only no Guinness, but no dark beers on draft. Strike 1 Found a nice looking shrimp Thai salad... And asked about soup... None that I cared for, so I asked for chilli... Nope ... No chilli... Strike 2 Wife ordered a meal and a side salad... A lengthily discussion ensued due to the fact that they do not have any common dressings ... Finally got the honey balsamic... Little did we know that it really didn't matter... We never got the salad! ... Strike 3 When our meals arrived I would have loved my wife to have taken a picture of my face... In the large shallow dish was the smallest $11 salad I've ever seen... It was about 5 inches in diameter... And an inch deep... With 6 shrimp. About 8 forks and I was done. Wow... Strike 4 The waiter didn't ask if we would like dessert, and its just as well as we couldn't wait to get out of the place. Have to add the fact that of the 4 flat screens that I could see... 2 displayed nothing... Broken? ... Don't know... The one that I had the best view of had kdka news on ... How entertaining... Another funny thing that I'll remember... While waiting for our food... And that salad that never arrived... We had been sitting for 10 minutes with 2 glasses of water... The waiter stopped by and asked \"how is everything?\" ... I replied that the ice water was great. My wife said that my reply was mean... I told her that I disagreed... If I wanted to be mean I would have told the waiter that I ordered ice water with lemon and didn't get the lemon. Another disappointing restaurant in Murrysville... Too bad.\n",
      "More like 2.5 stars. Not the best Applebees I've been to but not the worst either. They seem to have some strange policies in place. If you order car side to go after 8:00 they make you go into the restaurant. They also won't seat until your entire party is there even if your entire party is two people and the restaurant is fairly empty. The servers were fairly unprofessional. At one point our server shouted over our table to the bar tender about something. I suppose that sort of thing happens when the oldest employee that evening appered to be under 30 years old. Not that people who are young can't be professional, but this crew certainly was not. Service was also fairly slow. Often I had to ask more then once for either more water or a side of sauce. Food is typical of any Applebees. As long as you go expecting chain restaurant food, you won't be disappointed. The best deals are to go after 9 and get half off of a nice selection of appetizers.\n",
      "Was never a fan, except for the amazing blondie brownie dessert. My visit yesterday was pretty good. The server was friendly, and very accommodating to questions, requests etc., I have multiple food in tolerances. In the end I had a plain cheeseburger without bun and plain sweet potato fries. Both were very good. Burger was a bit small but cooked right and clearly very fresh.\n",
      "I stopped by here just to get a Caesar salad and meet my sister for some drinks. It wasn't busy tonight so I was happy that I wouldn't have to wait or squeeze through the large crowds. By the time I got to the restaurant my sister had already ordered her meal. She got the shrimp and rice dish which I thought was very bland. The rice was cooked pretty well and the shrimp too but it just tasted like tomatoes nothing special. I ordered a Cesar side salad and my hubby got the Blondie dessert dish. Both were pretty good I finished all my salad and I had a small bite of his Blondie which taste like a vanilla brownie. It wasn't 9 o'clock yet so I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the discount appetizers and drinks specials but I still managed to order me a long island. It wasn't that strong which is what I prefer but it tasted a lot like lemonade as opposed to ice tea. I do like how they updated the place and I don't really have any bad things to say about it but it is just a typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. most of the food sometimes does taste like it came from a microwave package. I guess it's what you can expect from a chain place although there are some better Applebee's but this one just happened to be the closest to my house.\n",
      "Food was awfulllllllllllll!! Beer was good. Cold and fast. Food was worse than TV dinners. Absolutely nothing at all like the TV commercial that brought me into the restaurant for dinner. Sloppy presentation. No taste. What could be worse? I ordered a salad with chicken to go for my lunch at work the following day. Sooo, at work I remove my salad from the refrigerator and consider eating it. Two other employees asked me about the wilted brown-tipped broccoli in the container. I threw the entire container away without taking a bite. That was about $10-11 including tip tossed in the trash. Next day after extensive searching for a contact for the Monroeville, PA location, I sent an e-mail describing my excellent beer, pretty good service, mediocre meal not finished and the terrible salad packaged to-go. There was no sarcasm at that time, just an honest description of the food and service. The manager's response was that I should ask for him or another manager when I returned. No refund offered. No \" come in for a free meal to offset two awful meals previously paid for.\" I would not return for a $100.00 gift card. The experience and response fits Applebee's. Neither are worth consideration. Maybe that is why the restaurant was nearly empty when I visited. Save your money. Get \"fast food\" instead. That would be better!\n",
      "It's Applebee's. Let's get that out of the way right now- it's a chain, the food isn't gourmet, and if you are expecting to be blown away, you will be disappointed. That said, the food is good and the server I had on Monday was awesome. It's a shame I didn't catch his name, because I'd request him. He was attentive, friendly and personable, and patient with my party's disorganized ordering process. I was there around lunch time, and it was busy but not packed. Everything was clean (including the bathrooms), and everyone I encountered was friendly.\n",
      "6th time. 1st time horrible meal. Brought wrong order to guest, my pork chop was cooked 2 death. Not edible . Did not comp my dish. I just wanted the cook to use an instant-read thermometer so hopefully the next guest would not get screwed.\n",
      "Slow service and mediocre food. Typical chain.\n",
      "Don't bother, awful service with no compensation. Food tasted like it was microwaved. Will not go back to that applebees, I'll like West Mifflen applebees though.\n",
      "I'm into OMB. I went to their brewery on Southside Dr last weekend and was able to go on one of their brewery tours. Free tours happen on Sat at 2p, 3p, and 4p. They started about 30 min late for our 2p tour - but I think that was to encourage product tasting beforehand in their \"tap room.\" The tap room is a great space. It has nice vaulted ceilings, beer hall chandeliers, and wood paneling. It is a very clean and comfortable space. I wish it was in a more urban location versus a warehouse district - but it is still nice for a daytime adventure. The tour itself lasted about 30 min and was interesting - mostly covering their history, production process, ingredients in their beers, and german purity laws that they adhere to. Beer is reasonably priced there - though there are only 3 OM options served - Copper, Mecklenburger, and a seasonal pick. There is also food, but it is more of an accompaniment to the beer and consists of things like brats and giant pretzels.\n",
      "Joined The Olde Mecklenburg Brewery for their 4th Anniversary party and to try out their brews and enjoyed it thoroughly, mostly because my husband got their bourbon brew and underestimated the alcohol content. Hilarious. Enjoyed a nice soft pretzel and their potato salad and grilled cheese. The food wasn't amazing, but wasn't bad and went great with their cold beers. I went for their amber ale, and for someone like me who isn't a beer expert by any means, it was good. Nice big open space, live music, good affordable food and a nice young crowd makes for a good night and good times. Hopefully, they'll do some more marketing and have more live music and I can definitely see myself coming back again.\n",
      "This review is for the tour only, not the beer (which is quite good) or food (which we didn't have). While waiting for the tour, a waitress came over to take our food order. We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product.\n",
      "First night living in Charlotte, and we hit up a pizza joint that was serving the seasonal Mecktoberfest. I wanted to try something local, and this was it! By far the best beer since the good Lord blessed us with fermentation! Smooth and crisp with an aroma that hits you as soon as you bring the glass up to your pie hole. It doesn't leave you thirsty either, like some other micro's I've had. The amber lager is...redonkulous. I'm dying to try the others, yet haven't been able to find the allusive OMB Copper...it's like Bigfoot; it's only been spotted a little while ago... Noosh!\n",
      "OMB has done a wonderful job with the new location. You can tell that a lot of careful thought was put into every detail and it leads to a beautiful space that you want to spend time in. I can see this being a wonderful event space, weddings in that beirgarten would be amazing! My only complaint about the decor is that there is very little lighting outside. Servers came around and lit candles inside of cute lanterns that sit on the tables but they didn't provide much light. I think that space would look AMAZING if they had old fashioned christmas lights strung throughout the umbrellas, this would really add some charm and much needed light. I only tried the pretzel with beer cheese, but they have some work to do. The beer cheese had very little cheese flavor and was grainy. Maybe my standards are too high because I will compare every beer cheese to VBGB, but I think they can do better. Since they are still getting their footing the food took awhile to be served. I would say it was almost 30-40 mins before burgers and bratwursts arrived after we ordered them. I am sure that will improve as they get into the swing of things. It goes without saying that the beer still tastes great, I have no complaints here! I look forward to spending lots of time here, it is a beautiful location.\n",
      "This is such a great hidden gem. A brewery hidden away in the warehouse district off South Blvd makes you feel like your in an old world beer garden. The bratwurst is awesome and the beer is even better.\n",
      "The only way to get fresher beer than this in Charlotte is to brew it yourself. From the Copper, to the Mecklenburger to their always changing seasonals, you can't go wrong with any of their beer selections. The ambiance is also great. While you drink your traditionally German brewed beer, you're transported to an old-world-style German pub. The tables are clean, the servers are friendly, and you're never left sitting there with an empty glass.\n",
      "Olde Mecklenburg beer in the Dortmund-style takes some effort to warm up to. Sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a VERY harsh initial taste. German beer by it's nature typically mellows the Hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff. Rolled on a second Copper and it finally started to get a tad better. Their winter brew is simply awful. This is really not what a German beer is supposed to be doing to you. Ordered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun. Very sad to experience. Guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks. Brewery itself is off in an industrial area very close to I-77. The tap room is done up nicely. Lots of wood and warmth but that only means you'll have to stay there and drink the product. Lastly make sure you MapQuest this place out for your visit because it'll take at least three employees to direct you there. Hopefully they'll replace the current brewmaster with someone that's had German beer before. May be just OK to pop in and check out quickly.\n",
      "Really dug this place. I liked the feel of it -just a huge hall with tables in it -and the tour was very informative. It was nice to see where all they distribute their beer and have it on tap---seeing local businesses succeed always makes me happy. This would be a great place to take an out of towner who appreciates beer or to catch a game. I tried the Mecklenberger and Cooper and both were tasty with full flavor. They had a cart dude outside selling brats and dogs but think they could really capitalize on a menu inside (at least apps instead of just pretzels). Last time I checked drinking copious amounts of beer leads to food consumption. And who doesn't love bar food?\n",
      "I love good beer, and OMB is the best place to drink high quality beer in Charlotte. OMB has a great vibe, it has a lot of space and attentive employees. They have multiple beers, Copper, Mecklenburger, Captain Jack, and Mecktoberfest..are a few...some are light, some are darker. All the beers are smooth and have great flavor, just depends on what youre into that day. OMB even gives you free pretzels...A awesome place!\n",
      "My wife and I ate here on May 6th and had some of the worst service we've had in a long time. It took 20 minutes just for the server to bring us our drinks, just 2 beers. Nothing fancy. Then we waited over an hour for our food and all we ordered was a bratwurst and a chorizo sausage. We finally left because waiting that long for that small amount of food is absurd. When we told the server we just wanted to pay for the drinks and leave, she gave us attitude like we were inconveniencing her and pissing her off. The place was busy but if you can't keep your composure while being a server, you should probably find something else to do. I will stick to buying this beer in the store and cooking brats at home. I think I will have a much better time.\n",
      "OMB is a great place to have some tasty beers and hang out with some friends. The atmosphere is cool. It's a wide open modern building with hardwood floors. I tried their Mecktoberfest brew yesterday and it was delicious! And I'm always a fan of the Copper as well. The only downfall to this place for me is they don't serve any kind of snacks. The hubby and I met with our university alumni group early in the evening but we didn't have a chance to eat beforehand. I was starving by time we were finishing up our drinks and ready to leave, not to mention having beers on an empty stomach did a number on me. We will definitely be back for more, but I'll make sure to eat first.\n",
      "My husband is into craft beer so we went there with some friends while we were in town. They tried 8 beers, a friend said they didn't vary too much in taste in her opinion, but they were good. They had a small German-themed snack menu and some Wurst meal options. The waitress... working in a brewery bringing people flights of beer... didn't know what a taster glass was :-/\n",
      "I too enjoyed a great night at OMB for the Brewer's Ball. What a fantastic venue (I look forward to touring soon). The place is well suited for medium to large crowds and had a nice porch area if you needed to get a bit more breathing room. Love the Mecktoberfest - it's very drinkable which is nice for a fall beer, because some can be a bit spice-heavy.\n",
      "Consistently excellent beer. They stick to the German purity law which means its nothing too crazy, but its all really good, fresh and flavorful beer. My favorites are the Captain Jack Pilsner and the Copper. I think they routinely have something like four different beers, which in my opinion is the way to do it, just really perfect a handful of brews. They also have good seasonal releases too. The location is sort of out in the cut in a warehouse area off South Blvd but the place itself is really cool, very spacious, lots of wood, kind of that \"pub\" feel. Lots of outside seating as well... and cornhole boards. Great place to spend an afternoon with friends.\n",
      "The Copper is my new lover. No really, there's proof in an incriminating photo of me kissing a bottle of the stuff. It's delicious, so much so that the boy got a bottle to take back home with us. I also tried another \"very hoppy\" version, which wasn't quite to my tastes so I forget the name. If you like a lot of hops, though, you'd love that beer! I love that it's more traditional right down to the beer hall you sit in, and the staff is well-trained in German brew methods. I didn't get to go on a tour as there was a race in the morning followed by World Cup viewing in the afternoon, but I'd love to go behind the scenes and watch the beer brewing in action. Fantastic and wish it was as far south as Atlanta, though four hours away isn't too bad I suppose!\n",
      "Found this place near my hotel. Thank god. It looked a bit simple from the outside, but very nice on the inside. I was lucky to tag along on a free tour of the brewery. Dennis? (Sorry if I forgot your name) gave a great enthusiastic tour. The beer was great. I've had many bourbon barrel aged beers and theirs was good. Fresh beer. Hope to visit again soon. Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I didn't try the food.\n",
      "I was very disappointed. A group of us went on a Friday night for live music. They are in dire need of an interior decorator. We felt awkward as soon as we walked in the door. There were basically picnic benches for tables and nothing on the walls. The beer was good but the atmosphere is lacking.\n",
      "Small Microbrew but Big on heart... I had the wonderful opportunity to be exposed to this brewery at the First Charlotte Elite Launch Event @ Customshop. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the lineup of beers from OMB. The quality, taste and finish of these beers makes me wish I was born in Bavaria! This location is what heaven must be like. There is a brewery in the back and a nice beer garden in the front with massive ceiling but most importantly FREE BEER! DISCLAIMER: Free beer is tomorrow and only found in heaven not at OMB. I would recommend going with the Old Meck. It is a full body lager with a clean finish and robust taste. The staff here was busy but the service was impeccable. The owner was making the rounds checking on the customers. How many places have you gone in Charlotte and meet the dude who crafted your beer? I think that two great Americans sum up my thoughts on beer... \"Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.\" - Ben Franklin \"Alright Brain, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But lets just do this, and I can get back to killing you with beer.\" - Homer Simpson\n",
      "We decided to do a tour of the breweries in Charlotte and OMB was our first stop. First off, let me say that the atmosphere is absolutely incredible! I For those that have expressed a distaste for it, they need to recognize that OMB modeled their tasting room after a German beer hall. I love the large spacious inside and the picnic tables outside are a real treat for the beautiful North Carolina days. It's also great that they have a food selection, as opposed to many other breweries. However, I imagine that this might make them less likely to have food trucks as I've seen so often at other breweries. My major complaint with OMB was their beer selection and quality. I admire breweries with the balls to brew under the Reinheitsgebot, which is the German purity law allowing only water, barley, and hops. Provisional laws later allowed added yeast (at the time its role wasn't recognized in the brewing process despite its presence), wheat malt, and cane sugar. However, I truly feel that brewing under these requirements can stifle creativity and the flavor creations that can come from the use of other adjuncts. Despite trying their flight and sipping on a few, I was disappointed in their beer selection.\n",
      "I know this place and it's beers are pretty popular in the charlotte area but I just can't get into them. I've tried several of their beers and even went by their tasting room for the BBQ/Cornhole deal they put on this last weekend but I still don't like them. The beers themselves taste a little skunky to me and I get it that it's supposed to be \"german beer\" but they just seem to be missing something in the brewing process or adding another step or whatever it is, just makes them taste off to me. I would still much rather have beers from Noda brewery or even Birdsong before OMB. The one thing I can say is that their tasting room/brewery is done up very nicely. There is plenty of seating for everyone and the interior is all new and very clean. They could probably use a couple more TV's as they only have one above the bar and it's at a angle where only a small part of the room can see it.\n",
      "Best beer in Charlotte - if not in the US! Being originally form Germany I can attest that this beer tastes just like it does in Germany. They're brewing the beer based on the German Beer Purity law from 1516 and their brewmaster is actually from a German brewery in Duesseldorf. If you like beer - you'll love this place!\n",
      "I like the beer. I was at a bar drinking the OMB beer and read the reviews of the Brewery and thought I'd try it out. MISTAKE. Only a dozen people there, 5 of which were 5yo and under running around making it their personal play pen. The oblivious parents did nothing. The kids were running between my legs and behind the bar. I hinted to the one bimbos working there that it was very annoying and she just giggled. Screw that!!! I left with half of a pint of good beer going to waste. A place that lets this go on deserves no business. Oh...2 choices of beer. Whooo hoo... back to the bar but never back here\n",
      "YUM! My sister is in town and wanted to do something different while visiting the Queen City. My husband brews his own beer and thought it might be neat to take a tour of a brewery to show my sis what he does on a much larger scale. Our 'tour guide' was really dynamic and informative. They let you drink the beer when you're on the tour, which was a bonus! We sampled all of the beers they had to offer and all of them were really yummy! They have house made pretzels and spicy musturd to order, which I would definitely reocmmend. Love that they are local and just serve the charlotte metro area. We will be back!\n",
      "Chances are, you've never experienced a place like this. The atmosphere is laid back with either rock music casually playing or live music. You can stand by the bar, get a growler to go (Growlers, esp. refills are crazy cheap) or just pick a spot inside or out. The servers are very calm and relaxed and just float between tables to help when needed. They're now open for lunch during the week too so it's kind of nice to go relax in there. The tours, which are on the weekend are completely free and really enlightening. I'd suggest checking it out!\n",
      "Some would say that cutting hair is a work of art and if that's the case there's a reason why this place is called Shaving Grace cause it's the Sistine Chapel when it comes to getting haircuts. The Michael Angelo of this establishment would be no other than the owner Boris who shows nothing but love and respect to all that come through. Leonardo da Vinci aka Ruben has been cutting my hair over the last 3 years and I guarantee you'll come out of his chair with a cut that looks better than the Mona Lisa. Plain and simple though I've seen hundreds of haircuts from all the barbers there - Stanley, Sulik, Shlomo, Gina, & Mike and they all do incredible work. If you're looking for a great cut, great price, and that feel good barbershop experience cruise into Shaving Grace and they'll take care the rest.\n",
      "This barber shop, managed by Boris, is a top-notch place to get a professional haircut. The barbers are highly experienced and they genuinely care for their customers. I live in North Scottsdale, but I gladly make the drive to Shaving Grace Barber Shop because I can count on getting a great haircut every time.\n",
      "I was happy when I found out Boris went on his own and opened his own barber shop. I had been going to his Dad Eddie at his father's formenr shop for over 7 years. Eddie came on board with his son and I was reunited with my great father and son barbers. Now I see Boris more than I see his dad. He has stayed late for me on more than one occasion and when you find guys like these it's worth the extra drive. The reading material is always top notch. The hot towels, warm shaving cream, and shoulder massage make me feel like I'm back in Brooklyn. I will be seeing them for sure for the next 7 years\n",
      "I went in and got a haircut from Rueben this morning, phenomenal haircut! He is always on his game.\n",
      "Great place to get yourself fresh. Three weeks latter and I'm still on Low Maint! (Top and Front). Ask for the first chair who is Borris. Cash only folks..\n",
      "Hands down best haircut in Scottsdale. I have been to many other barbershops in Scottsdale and been disappointed by the haircut I received, but Shaving Grace is a cut above the rest. I have had my haircut by several of the barbers who work here and have never left disappointed. Bottom line if you wanna look sharp head over to Shaving Grace.\n",
      "I was in desperate need of a haircut while visiting the area. Looked online and saw how many wonderful reviews this place had so I decided to give them a shot. So glad I did!!! From the moment I entered Boris treated me like he has been cutting my hair for years! There was a little bit of a wait but as a walk in customer that was expected. I was just glad he was able to fit me into his busy schedule. I never had someone spend more time on my hair, but it was a perfectionist at work. Boris was very professional, very funny at times and my business felt appreciated. Boris your words were very true. There are a few good barbers, and many lousy ones. Your defintely one of the good ones. Will defintely come back when my flight attendant career takes me through Phoenix!\n"

      "Almost a year since Shaving Grace became my go to shop in Scottsdale. Added a shave to my monthly visit - fantastic! Boris and the guys at Shaving Grace get it. Best haircut and shave experience, far exceeds anything I found while living downtown Chicago.\n",
      "Great barbershop. I generally roll in about every 2 weeks to get my beard trimmed and I have had nothing but great experiences and results. I trust everyone in there for the trim, not just one person in particular. Good atmosphere, good pricing and always quick. I would recommend highly.\n",
      "I love this place! Boris is amazing, he's very attention to detail. Boris also employed great barbers too. Every time I come in I get a great haircut and the price is reasonable. I highly recommend this place if you want a quality cut.\n",
      "This was my second time at Shaving Grace and I am thoroughly satisfied with my haircut, beard trim, and shave. Boris is easily the best barber I have ever used.\n",
      "I greatly appreciate you trying to cover up your lack of customer service. Again, when I called your shop asking general information so I could find my new barber. Unfortunately, I was greeted with a person on the receiving end of an attitude \"I'm having a bad day, why are you asking so many questions\". When ever you are having a bad day... Please do not take it on the caller. Especially a prospect client. Then a solidified my review by being argumentative to not judge a book by its cover. I was not judging it's book by its cover. I was simply stating facts. Again when I contacted Scottsdale Barber Shop. I was greeted as I should have been greeted by your shop \"with thanks for considering and appreciation of me giving your shop my business. Please do not make your shop look any worse with another negative comment. But consider apologizing and offer gratitude with going above and beyond... Have a blessed day... Response from the owner in private message... Enjoy future clients... What is wrong with you? Appologygse, for what? Thank you, for what? You came across one of my guys having a bad day, and instead of telling me in a privet message, you post it for public viewing? Why? To damage my reputation? Or so I can offer something to you for free? I ve been around my friend and \"no thank you\" to customers/clients/friends... like you. Don't you worry too much about how we look, long before you and long after you gone, we will still be here. We appreciate the blessings!) And another private message from yours truly \"Shaving Grace Barber owner\"... \"Thanks for writing, but next time, no need for passive/aggressive & entitled comments. Since you were so kind, I would like to state a few \"facts\" of my own- A- any questions you may have had are answered on this very website you are \"reviewing\" us on. B- We are a super busy shop, so brief and to the point on the phone that way our attention is the customer in the chair getting the service they pay for. C- You must be a phone sex operator or something, being so critical of phone etiquette. D- no apology here, rather a \"thank you\" for going elsware. Your the type of guy we would ask to leave, if you showed up anyway. E- In the end, your a troll. Your only review is a negative one for us, not even a positive one for the \"other shop\". Even though they treated you so well. I also see no pic on profile, I don't blame you. If you face is half as ugly as your personality, you're saving us again, so thanks- I can say a lot more, but I think we all get the drift, good luck Nick & go you know where ;-)\"\n",
      "Cool looking place. Great ambience. Gives the feeling of a real barber... However I had a girl at the last chair cut my hair and it was prob worse than someone still in school. I could have done a better job by myself and a mirror. I tried to guide her at the end on how I want. Simple fade and she couldn't figure it out... The best is she asked if she should fix it? I couldn't have left any faster, how can you fix a fade that you couldn't do riggt the first time? Maybe the guys there are better but I will never return to this place. Biggest waste of $25 and more importantly my time!!\n",
      "I have rotated through all the barbers at this place and they have all given me a more than exceptional cut every time. I do and would recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Simply put, these guys have hooked me up every time. I've had 3 different people cut my hair and all of them have taken good care of me. I just moved here from out of town a d was dreading having to find a new barber. Luckily I struck gold with the first place I tried.\n",
      "As a guy who typically visits high priced salons for a haircut I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the cut I received from Simon. An East coast guy who knows how to use a razor. He was always checking to see how I liked what he was doing, ensuring I was happy when I left. Ask for Simon leave happy.\n",
      "I'm reviewing for my boyfriend because he doesn't review things - there's a reason this shop has the most, best reviews in Scottsdale. He always comes home raving about the great atmosphere. Yeah, a great barber shop needs to give a good cut, but men look for a good experience while they're there as well, and Boris and his guys give it. My boyfriend won't go anywhere else now. They always do a great job (I love the straight razor shave) and you can't beat the price. Great location as well.\n",
      "Boris and his team are top notch! I've gotten my hair cut here at least 6 times, from four different barbers, and each experience has been great. One time, Boris even came in early, before the shop officially opened, so I could get a cut before catching a flight. There's a reason this barbershop is one of the busiest in the Valley (yet I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a walk-in).\n",
      "My son is picky with his hair cut but they did an awesome job! This will be our to go place when getting cuts.\n",
      "These guys know how to cut hair. I was on my way out of San Diego for business and decided to stop at this shop instead of my usual before I left. Thank you guys for doing a great job! I will most defiantly return as he could even get my son to sit still long enough for a good hit cut.\n",
      "This is HANDS DOWN the place to go if your looking a superior barber shop in Scottsdale. Boris and crew have a natural talent when it comes to cutting hair and give nothing but exceptional service to all who enter. They know all their customers by name when they walk in the door making it a warming experience. The cuts are quick, with precision and exactly as ordered as all of the barbers know just what each person is looking for. Its only an added bonus that being in their is pure entertainment. The banter between all the barbers is hilarious and like sitting front row at a comedy show. I would definitely call ahead though and book a spot in the books as they are always busy due to high demand. Without a doubt I strongly recommend Shaving Grace Barber Shop to anyone I know personally, for I know they will not be disappointed. Thank you Shaving Grace!!\n",
      "Recently moved to Scottsdale and found this great Barber Shop. Everyone was very friendly and the Gal that Cut my hair (Gena) was just great. She was attentive to my needs and took the time to give me the perfect haircut. The place takes me back to the upscale Barber shops in New York, with its black & white floors and wood paneling's, and they offer services such as straight razor shaves and the hot towels, of days gone by. Just a great place , I will be back.\n",
      "Love this joynt - just moved into the neighborhood from Arcadia and decided my old barber just wasn't worth the extra drive, so Shaving Grace gets my business now. Stanley cut my hair and we entertained each other with stories - he is an Uzbek, and I have actually been to Uzbekistan, so I told him that story, He gave me one of the best cuts ever, including hot towel and vibro-massage of my neck and shoulders. Service with a smile? More like service with a story. My new barbers now.\n",
      "My boyfriend went in for a haircut, and decided instantly that this will be the only place he'll go to get his hair cut while he's in town.\n",
      "Great place to get a quality haircut. Service is top notch....hot towel, shoulder massage and attention to detail make this a classic barbershop. Boris and the crew are pros and take pride in making you look sharp.\n",
      "This is an awesome barbershop! Boris got me all nice and cleaned up perfectly for my wedding plus the guys are funny as hell with the conversations and jokes going around. Definitely a recommended place!\n",
      "Overall outstanding experience. Made a call, in the chair less than 30 minutes later. Quality fixtures, talented barbers. Will definitely return for my monthly cut.\n",
      "Best haircut I've gotten in a long ass time and they're New Yorkers. Feels like a hang out with the boys more than getting a haircut. If highly recommend this place. Oh on the plus side, free hot towel and back massage!\n",
      "Best barbershop in town. Eddie and Boris do great customer service, they make you feel like family. On top of that, they've given me some of the best haircuts I've ever had. No one pays more attention to detail than these guys, they do perfect fades. This is a legit barber shop where they cut your edges with a straight razor, hot towel treatment on your face, and a shoulder massage at the end. Don't come here for a quick 10 minute haircut, these guys do masterpieces with your hair.\n",
      "Nothing but good things to say about this place. I went in with my boyfriend so he could get his haircut, and being that they dont cut girls hair I was planning to sit and watch. Boris kept me company with some great conversation after he finished up with a customer, which was awesome. Super laid back atmosphere, definitely a man cave feel. And to top it off the haircut was great! 5 stars, no question.\n",
      "Hands down the best haircut I've ever had! I was working in Arizona for the week and was looking for a spot I could get a good haircut. I came across Shaving Grace and got exactly that. The guys are easy-going. You basically get a haircut/ shave and a show.\n",
      "Alex was my guy and he took care of business. No nonsense and attention to detail was off the hook. I had to get my dome completely shaved bald and my beard cleaned up. I have a full beard and haven't shaved my head in a while. Needless to say I was due for some grooming and clean up. Alex was COMPLETELY thorough and meticulous. He knew what had to be done and did it. He didn't cut any corners and made sure not only to get the job done at a high level but to make sure the experience was top notch. Hands down this was my best barber shop experience quality of work wise ever. If you go here make sure to ask for Alex. This is a barber shop so if your looking for a hair salon atmosphere or experience this ain't it. Thanks for a job well done and a great experience.\n",
      "Shaving Grace- Borus and the whole squad are probably the best in the valley at what they do. I'm leaving AZ for good, and i'll miss this place very much. The cuts are always clean.. consistent over about a year and a half of going here. The setup in the shop is pretty sweet. Overall the place is awesome and i'll be back any time i'm in town.\n",
      "This review is long overdue. I'll keep it short and simple, If you're a guy that cares about his hair then come here. They only have the best of the best cutting your hair and Borris will make sure you're leaving happy. It has a laid back vibe that you can come and hangout in the rare occasion that you have to wait. No matter who cuts me up, I'm always leaving happy\n",
      "Hands down the best cut in town. Skilled with the clippers & scissors so the fade is always clean. This it's an authentic barber shop complete with hot towel service & a quick shoulder rub after your cut. If you want to pay $8 for an amateur cut or can't handle barber shop talk, you should probably sick to Supercuts.\n",
      "Boris, Eddie & the crew at Shaving Grace are my \"barbers for life.\" I cannot speak volumes enough about how fantastic the quality of their haircuts for me and my 2 sons. Also pretty entertaining & likable guys. Besides, where can you go in Metro Phoenix / Scottsdale and get your haircut in a chair right next to a Phoenix Sun player?\n",
      "Exactly what you want out of a barbershop. Great conversations, cuts, and prices. Not to mention the no-fee atm in the back. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I have been loyal to Shaving Grace for almost 3 years now and have no plans of leaving, so long as I'm anywhere near Arizona. After visiting dozens of barber shops- half of which are in the Tempe/Scottsdale area- I have definitely found the best one. Seriously though, these guys (and girls) are awesome. I came here as a recommendation from a friend and was not disappointed. I am loyal to Ruben but have also had my hair cut from the infamous Boris himself. They are both very talented barbers and among the best I have ever been to. I have seen the work of all the other barbers as well and have been very impressed- you really can't get a bad cut here. I could write and boast about their talent all day but it's really something you have to see for yourself. However, what really separates them is their great service and atmosphere. Even on their busiest days with little heads up, they always manage to work me in. (That being said, you should always give them as much notice as possible- don't be that guy) There have been times I've had to wait but its never been longer than 25 mins- and they were upfront about the wait. Everyone there is friendly, outgoing and personable. All the barbers are very close with each other and the countless regular customers. Almost every customer is greeted by name when they walk in and thanked on their way out. After each cut you receive a quick back massage and a hot towel to the head which feels amazing. I've had my fair share of crazy experience in the past years including the power for the whole block going out mid hair cut (Someone outside ran into a pole knocking out the power-not a regular thing). Ruben barely hesitated as he switched from clippers to scissors- still managing to give me a perfect cut. Boris also finished working on his customer seamlessly with no power and only using the light coming in from the front door! There was also a time I blamed Ruben for giving me a bald spot only to find out I had alopecia. I had no idea what it was and not only did the guys explain it to me, but gave me advice on how to get my hair back. I listened to their advice and had my hair back in less then a year without buying any outside products. tl:dr This barber shop surpasses all others with incredible talent, service, and a great atmosphere. You have to give them a try, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "I travel all over the US for work, I've gotten haircuts in NY and in LA but hands down this place is the one to beat!!! The customer service in outstanding and the haircut was on point! It felt like how a real barbershop should feel!\n",
      "Great traditional barber. Had a great haircut, and nice detailed shave, old school! This is the kind of men's grooming service you just don't get very often these days. Knew my military style cut without me having to explain it like I do at strip mall bargain cutters. You feel confident they know what they're doing.\n",
      "Anything goes when it comes to the conversations between the barbers here. It's hilarious, but might offend some people...not me! This is the 4th time that I have been there, and they never disappoint. They give fabulous man haircuts, sharp edge razor trim around the ear and neckline, and an upper back massage. All for $20! If you are a man, you need to check this place out!\n",
      "Took my 10 year son here, for his first \"real\" haircut. They were extremely nice and it was only $1 different in price from sports clip for youth. Highly recommend. They did a very good job. My son felt like a big kid too.\n",
      "Traveled here for work from DC and needed a great \"old school style\" Barber... came here based on YELP reviews... best decision I made all week. The guys had me laughing and Ruben - Brooklyn, NY- gave me the best cut and shave I've had in a long time.\n",
      "This is the best Barber Shop I've been to in decades. Eddie is a damn maestro, I'm tellin' ya. Just finished my first visit and I'm sold for life. It's the real deal. I'm not a 5 Star poster, usually, but this place is worthy.\n",
      "Boris is the man. Good price, great atmosphere, and I haven't had a cut I wasn't happy with.\n",
      "This place sets the standard in every way! Getting a cut is a blast...Boris is one of a kind. Talented, sharp, supreme barber, saavy and knows his stuff! Bring a pic, they'll make you look even better! Give yourself a little time, they are always busy, and well worth the wait for the best cut, shave and experience around! RUN, don't walk!\n",
      "Fantastic place, as close to an old fashioned men's barbershop as you are going to get these days. Good atmosphere and price is reasonable\n",
      "Great shop! Had Boris give me several cuts and he has always been on point. Gives all the little extra touches with the haircut. Not to mention this CAT is a character and always get a laugh!\n",
      "5 stars for the hair cut. The guys that have cut my hair have always done a nice job. 0 stars for the inappropriate conversation and lack of hygiene. The counters don't look like they are cleaned and sneezing into your hands and not washing before continuing isn't cool. Not a place for children as the conversations are x-rated and loud.\n",
      "Let me tell you something. This is a great place to get your hair cut. I have a very awkwardly shaped, over-sized head. I could have easily been cast as an extra for a movie like The Hills Have Eyes, but somehow Alex manages to earn me some compliments. My girlfriend loves how he cuts it. Very methodical and particular, every single time. Besides getting an awesome haircut, Shaving Grace is one of my favorite places to visit. It's more than just getting a haircut; it's an experience. I look forward to going because it is a way to unwind. The guys that work here are polite and hilarious. Do not be mistaken by their crude humor or bossy ways. They want you to be completely satisfied, and it's probably your fault if you aren't.\n",
      "I'd gone to at least 4 other highly rated salons/barbers looking for a decent haircut and somehow every one of them managed to mess it up. I decided to try this place out and was pleasantly surprised. This place is the real deal. Has a very authentic old-timely barber shop feel to it that I really appreciated with the added bonus of a tv in every station for each customer to watch. The guy who did my hair was young, early 20's so I was a bit skeptical, but he did a terrific job and he was quick. Probably the best cut I've had in at least 2 years. I also got a shave. The price of $30 kind of threw me off a bit, but the precision and detail that he put into it made it all worth it. My face hasn't been so smooth since I was 12 years old. I have a thick beard and very sensitive skin, which he picked up on almost immediately and did what he could to soothe my skin and eliminate razor burn. Friendly atmosphere, but probably best suited for men (obviously it's a barber shop, not a salon). Would highly recommend giving this place a shot as I have no doubt you'll end up going back, I know I will.\n",
      "Great service. Rueben is the dude. It was my first cut in Arizona and I won't be going anywhere else. Nothing but praise for this place.\n",
      "This is the first review I've written on yelp for a very good reason. I was waiting for something special and Shaving Grace is it! After a whole lot of research I decided that this was the place. All of the guys are so friendly and welcoming and I left with the best haircut I've ever had. If you have decided to get serious about your hair, give Shaving Grace a shot.\n",
      "AWESOME. I could stop there but that might not paint the full picture or give proper credit to Stanley for the next customer. Read almost all 5 Star reviews on Yelp and thought, \"Yeah, right. NO place is THAT good.\". Well it really was a 5 Star experience. (I was really entertained by Boris' reply to some of the lower ratings. Didn't meet Boris on this trip but I get the feeling THIS is the guy you want on your side in a discussion.) I had no appointment and knew no one working there. Walked in and Stanley was at one of the waiting chairs and I just thought he was a friendly customer making conversation. Once I wised up enough to realize he was one of the barbers, let him know what I wanted (haircut, goatee trim and full shave) and he sat me in his chair and went to work. He offered just the right amount of conversation and levity without being a \"Chatty Cathy\". I've never been one to talk much at the barber so I don't end up with a mouth full of hair. It is obvious that Stanley takes his craft seriously and is really good at his job. He went back and forth between different clippers, brushes, etc., until he was satisfied with the results. Once done with the haircut, he went to work shaving with different towels, face potions, etc. Not one nick or bump at all. Because this is the first time I've ever had anyone shave me, I appreciate that he kept checking with me to insure I was comfortable. This guy has the hands of a surgeon. No shake at all and really smooth. I noticed he felt as much as looked to know where he needed to keep shaving. He didn't stop until HE was satisfied my face was 100% smooth. I guess it goes without saying that I'll be back the next time I pass through. It was worth the $50 for a fun experience with a great outcome.\n",
      "The owner Boris, responded to my wife's bad review. He offered a refund and promptly did so with grace. Thank you for being good people even with our bad experience.\n",
      "All the negative reviews sound like whiny girls. It's a barber shop with men so expect appropriate conversation, the salon with ladies is always an alternative. If you don't like your cut say something they will fix it. If you can't wait 20 min make appointment If you don't like Jews or Russians don't go. Stop whining Legit spot\n",
      "Best barber shop. Boris the owner is the man. Ask for Rubin and give him good tips. Just don't get offended by their banter. I've been to several barber shops in the valley. Let these guys take care of you.\n",
      "Best place to get your haircut in town. I recently moved here from North Carolina and was looking for a good barber shop and this spot definitely exceeded my expectations. Just 100% good guys who know how to cut hair. This will be the only spot I go to get my haircut for as long as I live in Scottsdale. You guys are the best, thanks\n",
      "First time Review here. Visited this place on Monday. Pretty busy but was in a chair in 5 minutes. Alek took care of me. Great haircut, easy to talk to and he went above and beyond. I didn't have to ask him to do a single thing. I tend to be critical in Shops but I was impressed. Business gets handled in here but it's still enjoyable. Well done.\n",
      "Awesome barber! Ruben is the one to cut my hair whenever I need to get faded up! I know my hair isn't the easiest to cut but he makes magic happen! I'd recommend this place to anyone whos looking for a laugh and a great cut!\n",
      "I live 2200 miles away but make it a point to get a haircut here at least once a year because Boris is one of the best barbers in the country. Great vibe, great banter, 5 chairs!\n",
      "Great experience here yesterday on my first visit. Entertaining banter and conversation in a clean barbershop with a perfect hair cut.\n",
      "These guys do a phenomenal job. Boris runs a clean and efficient shop, and they take pride in their work which I appreciate and respect. I've been going to Shaving Grace for about 6 months now and every barber I've had has done a great job. Come here if you want the best men's hair cut in Arizona. But bring your sense of humor and be ready to laugh at a dirty joke (or three).\n",
      "These guys rock! I was in town on business and needed a haircut in the worst way. A quick Yelp search showed me these guys were right around the corner from my hotel, so I headed over. What a great group of guys and an awesome experience! They offer a hot shave around the neck and sideburns. Love this. If you haven't had this before, you're missing out. Warning: not for the Politically Correct or faint of heart. This was right up my alley. Dude central. If you are a hippster, I'd look elsewhere. For \"guys guys\" though, this is just what the doctor ordered! I may setup more business trips to Scottsdale just to come back! Highly recommended. Stanley rocks.\n",
      "Great haircut and prices can't be beat. Great shop and personalities! Awesome place.\n",
      "Stanley gave me the best hair cut I have ever gotten. He gave me exactly what I asked for. I have tried a few barbers and I have never been this satisfied. Great service. I will return. Aside from the great service I received personally there is a couple of other cool things about Shaving Grace. First, they have a flat screen next to the mirror at every chair.. which is awesome. Second, they seem like they're pretty busy but their wait times are really reasonable if you don't have an appointment. Third, they are cash only but they compensate buy having a free ATM in the back of the shop.\n",
      "Boris always cuts my hair. Great cut every time. Feel great afterwards. I do think the other barbers are great, I have seen their work and its on point. The shop only take cash but there is an ATM inside and its free of charge. The crew is funny, its a good atmosphere, opinions are shared often and a haircut never takes more then 30minutes. Its $20 for the cut and well worth your hard earned money. Its best to call and make an appointment. I have been to other barbershops, salon's and yes the walk-in special's. Non of them compare to the experience and fresh cut I get at Shaving Grace.\n",
      "Great haircut BUT.... Every time I leave this place I'm offended by something one of the barbers said. They give great haircuts but the sexual reference, religious/rascal stereotyping and drug humor is way over the top. I would not take my children there. Scottsdale Barber Shop down the street is much more family friendly. Also the Shaving Grace barbers don't clean up very well. The attired of the barbers and the cleanliness of the shop needs to be improved. It's a good place to go if you are in a hurry and have no other options.\n",
      "I've been getting my hair cut by Boris for almost 2 years now seeing him once a week. I really can't say enough good things about his work, it really does speak for itself. While it's true that there are other good barbers in Scottsdale there's really no one else I would go to as I am very happy with the service I get at Shaving Grace. If you're looking for a solid cut, great value and some interesting conversation this is the place!\n",
      "My husband received the best haircut ( detailed & clean) from here. The staff seem to all have skills & they are all very easy going. Anytime we are out that way we will definitely make the trip to the shop!\n",
      "Just happened upon this establishment. I live in another state and have planned my work trips so I can get my hair cut. True professional barbers and honest to the bone. If you want a great cut and a great experience try this place!!! Thanks to Boris and his employees!\n",
      "Best Haircut in the Valley hands down! I've been going here for 6 months. My wife is a travel nurse so we're always moving which makes it hard to find a good barber. We have lived in the west valley, Tempe, and now Scottsdale. These guys were recommended to me by a friend and they did not disappoint. I've gotten my hair cut by multiple barbers here and every one did a great job. I went in during spring training while it was busy and I thought I was gonna be waiting for awhile. I was out in under an hour. They take care of their regulars because they know they're the ones paying the bills year round. They take walk-ins but always try to give them a heads up with a call. They always find a way to work everyone in.\n",
      "Boris is hilarious in general these guys are pretty cool here I can usually call ahead to make sure my guy is in and if he is I'm in and out in a breeze plus what's cool is I feel like every time I walk out of the shop I'm so fresh and so clean clean lol they often tell jokes and keep it very real so if you have zero sense of humor it's likely you will get offended been going for a few years and will continue\n",
      "I've been looking for a true Barbershop for a min and this is the place. Boris is as advertised and my man Rudy is Legit; he is an artist with the clippers!! Located right next to Sprouts..check em out.\n",
      "Best place in AZ for a haircut. Boris the owner is that man and always takes care of you even if he has to stay late. You want a great spot for a great cut and great barbershop talk, come to the Grace!\n",
      "Hands down the best shop I've been too. This is a old school, no nonsense type of shop. My man Boris has been cutting my hair for over a year now and I go in once a week to keep my fade right. Hot laker, straight razor and a massage. Every barber in here has got talent so you'll be in good hands regardless. Make an appt of possible if not they can usually squeeze you in.\n",
      "Great haircut, fun guys working there, and a very good price. Ruben is awesome and did a phenomenal job with my hair and with the shave. I will 100% be back.\n",
      "The short story is I've been going here for well over a year and it's been great. The longer version goes like this. During the one year I have been going here, I have had my hair cut by Boris, Ruben, and several others. The experience and staff interactions have been consistently professional and friendly always showing attention to detail and overall great service. I strongly recommend giving Shaving Grace a try.\n",
      "I have been coming to Shaving Grace for over a year now... Boris, Reuben, and Alex have all cut my hair and I have left feeling like a million bucks everytime... Great service, fun barber shop atmosphere... I wouldn't ever go any other place...\n",
      "Old school Barber Shop at its finest! Needed to find a new place to get my hair cut. After reading all the great reviews I decided to give this place a try. Went in about 3pm and was immediately greeted by Alex and shown to his chair. Alex did a phenomenal job even taking time to deal with my recheck my part after he was finished. While I have enjoyed going to a stylist the last few years, there is no substitute for a real barber when it comes to service. I love the attention to detail they take when using the clippers and straight razor on the edges. Alex is a pro and the hot towel and massage at the end is great. As I was leaving Boris, and when other customers did, made a point to ask if I was happy with my Haircut and service. That's a great business owner. I'll be back.\n",
      "I gave Shaving Grace a shot on a whim due to another plan falling through. This place is awesome! I've never been to New York and have no experience with the mafia but this place has that cool 1920s feel to it. Everyone that works there makes you feel like you been their friend for ages and my haircut and a shave were top notch. My only complaint? They need some LA Dodgers swag in there!\n",
      "I've been looking for a barber for the past year! And I found it! Great attention to detail, very friendly staff, clean, and the barbers use straight razors like it's there 2nd hand! I really like this place. Oh and the stories they tell are funny!\n",
      "Danny cut my hair today. And he did a phenomenal job. Don't even bother going to another barber shop if you are within a 20 mile radius of here. They are the best.\n",
      "These guys are absolute professionals. Best shop in the valley! Boris and Eddie are incredible with a pair of clippers. Keep up the good work men!\n",
      "Consistently professional. Listens. To your desires. Appointments kept on time. Clean. Full supply of grooming supplies. Maintains the highest standards for entire staff. Perfectly matches the cut to all age and hair types. It's the b ed St Al a great price! P'S great shaved too.\n",
      "Wish I still lived in Arizona so I could visit and get my haircuts here. Boris and his team are great. Always fun, always cracking jokes, sports memorabilia everywhere. They do a great job with the cuts, its a blast going in there, and its affordable. What more could you want? Highly recommended.\n",
      "Decent hair cut, but if you find employees speaking Russian or Greek the entire time offensive,like me this is not the place for you.....haircut should be relaxing, I gave them 2 chances, 2nd time only English I heard was how would u like your cut....sad part is they all speak ENGLISH fluently....miss your homeland maybe you should consider going back....\n",
      "Great buys cut too. My 2 year son enjoyed it and was treated like an adult, not a kid, which made him feel grown up. Thanks guys!\n",
      "Moved into the area and was in search of a new barber shop. I've now been here twice and have not been disappointed. Shave, beard trim, hot towels and more. Can't ask for more. Always friendly. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "This is the only place I'll go to get my hair cut. I've been all over Phoenix looking for a good barber, and Boris and his team are the best in the valley by far. He always remembers me and more importantly remembers what type of cut I like. I always get in quickly when I call for an appointment too. Give these guys a try, you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Shaving Grace is an awesome place to get a haircut and shave. The guys take a lot of time and effort on each haircut they give and their shaves are the best I've ever had. They don't take too long but it's just long enough to feel like you're getting a quality cut. There's a reason why this place has maintained a 5/5 star rating.\n",
      "What more can be said about a local legend? When I think of Shaving Grace I think of the hilarious banter between barbers and clients, I think of consistently perfect haircuts, and I think of how nice it is to not have to constantly be looking for someone who knows how to get it right. I found Boris a couple of years ago through a friend and then verified their awesome reputation on Yelp. I had probably gone through about 4 different hairstylists before coming in because I could never get the same consistent quality in a haircut. Needless to say, the first time I stepped foot into the barbershop was the last time I stepped into a new one. If you're looking for a barbershop in the Scottsdale area, come to Shaving Grace. Hell, I moved to Chandler and I still drive to see Boris - he's worth it. He'll remember exactly how you like it done, and if you're ever unhappy he will do whatever it takes to make sure you're 100% in love with your cut. By the way, same goes for any barber on his staff, they all rock.\n",
      "Two haircuts for the two men in my life. Both look excellent. We came in and it was swamped but they worked us in anyway. This place is a cool old fashioned barber shop, including a quick massage. And they're definitely not racist. #BOOM\n",
      "Every guy who leaves this place has such an awesome haircut! No one else in Arizona can blend/fade like these guys.\n",
      "Came in last week for a haircut and a shave i absolutely loved the haircut and the shave. Im originally from California but just moved out here and finding a barber is always a very hard thing to do but im glad not this time. The service was absolutely awesome and a real barber shop atmosphere, i got my cut by a lady in the back (Gina) she was great with hearing me out and giving me what i wanted anyway i hope to see you guys when im back in town. Keep up the good work guys happy to have you in scottsdale!! Would give more stars but 5 is max ;)\n",
      "I've been looking for a barber shop in Scottsdale and phoenix for the past 10 years that I could rely on with no luck. I finally found that with this place. The first time I went I was lucky enough to get Alex cutting my hair. I have a bunch of cow licks that most barbers cannot figure out, and Alex did it with ease. He gave me the best hair cut I've ever had, and I had a good conversation with the other guys working throughout it. Something I really appreciated was how much work Alex put into my hair. He was finished, saw something he didn't like and went back and fixed it until it was perfect. I always ask for advice from these guys about hair styles and what products to use and they're always there to help. It's just a nice place to shoot the crap with some other nice dudes and get a solid hair cut for only $20. They're also very appreciative of any tip you give them. Anyone that gives a bad review is just trolling or a competitor; which in that case I would hate them too because they're great.\n",
      "After having my haircut done at a salon for the last decade, I decided to try out a barbershop once I had moved out to Arizona and needed a new haircut. Saw this place on Yelp, and can definitely say that Shaving Grace easily deserves its 5 star rating. These guys are top notch and they know how to cut men's hair. When I was done I realized my mistake in going to a salon for so long. The shop is clean and obviously well taken care of. Easily worth the drive down from North Scottsdale.\n",
      "I scheduled last minute the day before a holiday and Boris was wonderful to fit me in. Walking into a barber shop as a woman isn't always a great experience, but Shaving Grace was fantastic. Boris gave me a great, clean cut to all of my specifications. He was wonderful to chat with as well. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll be thrilled to return.\n",
      "Can't go wrong here, my guy is the new Alex. Hardly have to tell him how you want it and he'll get it done\n",
      "Those who know Primo know that I'm the risk-taking, living-on-the-edge gambler type, the sort your mom warned you against, the sort that has no problem letting strange barbers take their razor and scissors to my head with nothing but a Yelp recommendation for safety and comfort. That's why, when I found myself in dire need of a haircut while on business in Scottsdale-Phoenix, I ended up in the very competent, very talented, and very hilarious hands of the father and son duo that run this follicle trimmery a couple of blocks from the W Hotel where I was staying. The shop has the clubby feel of a man cave, with plush leather chairs, baseball memorabilia on the walls, and tvs tuned to The Fugitive (love that movie!). The experience was replete with mild racist, ageist and misogynist humor, the sort that sets apart an established shop from the crappy corporate owned chains whose sole intention is to upsell unnecessary products. At Shaving Grace, on the other hand, the only thing being sold aside from an excellent haircut is an old-world, graceful experience, and Primo now has a new go-to barber in Phoenix. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Ruben did a great job on giving me a low maintenance haircut that looks amazing. He took the time to show me how to style it and did an all around phenomenal job. I just asked for something good for a Vegas trip and he delivered. This is the only place I will go because it's a quality haircut everytime. The conversations in the store are always entertaining too. I have no understanding of the negative reviews because Boris will ask if you are satisfied with the haircut after every single one. This is a true five star shop.\n",
      "Been going here for years since they were located up in north scottsdale. Best hair cut I've gotten in Arizona. Tried multiple other barbers in the area none come close. The more you go the better they will take care of you. Don't be cheap tip them well a few bucks goes a long way.\n",
      "It's pretty simple why this place is the best. Respect: they will remember your name and treat you like you are the reason you are in business. Fun: always laughter and joking going on the whole time. Quality/speed: absolute precision when it comes to haircuts and beard trims and they work as if you are late to your next appointment.\n",
      "Top notch hair cut by old school barbers who pay attention to details and still treat the whole experience as a craft and not a sales pitch. Excellent cut and even better service.\n",
      "Boris is a squashed turd. 5 stars all around. I could care less if Boris shoved a brush up my ass, this guy is the real deal and the atmosphere is unlike anything youve seen.\n",
      "Great service. $19 haircut and barber trim is great deal for the attention to detail. Hot towel and backrub included. Espn was on the tv's which I enjoyed on the weekend. Will go back for sure.\n",
      "Great place, TV's in every booth, skilled barber gave me a clean scissor cut and shaved around my hairline with a shaving blade. Very professional and skilled barbers, 2nd to none. Thank you guys for the great cut!\n",
      "This place is special, and like no other barber shop or hair cut place you will find in AZ! 10 years ago I stumbled into to meet Boris and his father Eddie after a month long ski trip with an unruly beard and a desperate need for a hair cut before returning to work. This fateful day led to a long interesting journey of hair cuts, shaves, referrals, and many deep belly laughs that can only be described as priceless. Let me warn you that Boris and the Shaving Grace staff are usually PG-13, and often times NC-17 with their humor and take no shit attitude. Insults and compliments are dished out like candy and no matter how hilarious the verbal jousting gets, you are 100% guaranteed to leave with a precision cut and fully satisfied with your shave and hair-do. These guys are multi-generation Russian Jews that take the art or barbering seriously and their passion and pride in cutting hair is a devout practice. Make no mistake when you enter the shop you have stepped into their domain and they will treat you to the finest hair cut and shave offered in all of ARIZONA. Just enter with respect, a wicked sense of humor, and some humility. I now live in Denver and travel to the Phoenix area about every other month-- when I get into town, the first trip I make is to see Boris! You really can't get a cut this good or a laugh this hard anywhere else!! When you become a regular client these guys will bend over backwards to keep your business and will treat you like royalty. Doesn't mean they won't make fun of you at times, but like children teasing the boy/girl they like most with juvenile pranks, Boris and crew will openly tease and harass their most favorite customers. So if you're lucky enough to be harassed take it as a grand compliment and know you've made it into the \"inner-circle\" of clientele. In all seriousness Boris and crew can take it as well as they dish it, but we as the customer get the greatest cut, an enjoyable time at an old world barber shop, and the ability to just be real/honest/raw in a safe and politically in-correct environment that will keep you coming back for years to come. Shaving Grace cares about how you look. They will go out of their way to make you look as feel your very best. All ages, sexes, and hair styles are welcomed. I would recommend making an appointment, but they will accommodate walk-ins as well. And in case my review has made you weary, this shop has respect and manners when women and children are present, they-- definitely tone it all done. And truly most of the time all you can hear is the buzz of the well oiled clippers and the annoying sounds of Fox News on the TV. I ask to get a game on. Even if it's pool or cricket just so I don't have to hear the Fox News idiots for my entire cut... If you're overpaying some hot Scottsdale stylist just because you like the feel of her huge plastic boobs rubbing up against your head and shoulders-- STOP!!! Get over to see the crew at Shaving Grace ASAP. You'll get a better cut, save some $$$, and leave with the confidence to get any hot babe you desire. I am a fan and you'll be be too!! Give Boris a call and get him to put you on the books for your next cut. You'll be glad you did.\n",
      "Danny cut my hair, twice now. I'm pretty picky and this is one of the best cuts I've had--very clean lines and it grows out very nice. It's also a great experience, as others have noted.\n",
      "There's a reason why this place has the best rating it can get. Down to earth people that know what they're doing. Quality haircuts for a very affordable price. I've gotten my hair cut now but three different people there, and I've been stoked about all of them, especially the last one by the owner Boris. They're talented barbers that are able to give you any haircut you want with only a brief description. Every cut comes with a hot towel and hand massage at the end. If you're looking for an old school barber shop with people that really know what they're doing, definitely check this place out. The only thing I'm bummed about is moving away from Scottsdale next week. It's going to be hard to find another quality shop like this one. Keep at it guys. I'll see you next time I'm in Scottsdale.\n",
      "FANTASTIC. I got a head and face shave with Gina and she did an amazing job. I very rarely leave a barbershop without feeling like something was missing, but that was not the case here. Boris, Gina and all the other barbers here do great work. They like to joke around, have fun and give quality haircuts. Keep up what you're doing here, Boris.\n",
      "Boris, Ruben and crew... I miss you! Mom does a great job but you guys are the best! I'm coming back in the fall. I'm definitely stopping in!\n",
      "The Shaving Grace is a great place for haircut and will enjoy Boris and Eddie's views on everything in life from sports, politics, medicine (yes, Boris is half doctor :)-), philosophy and more...it's a great experience with excellent service. Keep up the good work. Abhay K\n",
      "I was in town for my brother's wedding, and my brother and I waited until a day before the first event to get a haircut and beard trim. We decided to trust Shaving Grace's Yelp rating, and it didn't steer us wrong. Boris wasn't available for an appointment, which made us a little nervous at first- but I must say we were both very pleased with our haircuts and beard trims that were done by the other guys. (Being from NYC, we're naturally tough judges when it comes to cuts.) The guys at the shop were all cool and it was a nice break from the hectic weekend- overall it was a great experience.\n",
      "Came to town for a few days, I was starting to look like a bum so I stopped by here. Great service, good cut, beard trim and a razor shave. They dont take credit cards, but do have an ATM on site. Walked out happy.\n",
      "I got my hair cut by Dan today. Very good and sharp barber. Will definitely be going back.\n",
      "I've been here a few times. It's true what everyone else says... great atmosphere. Boris welcomes everyone as if they were old pals. The guys all B.S. with the best of em. I love the hot towel service even though they sometimes smell a bit sour. I've seen father's ushering their boys into this den of masculinity. I just can't relax talk shop and enjoy the experience if I'm forced to listen to a woman hairdresser complain about how expensive Obama care is. I feel nearly guilty being critical about not having a guys only atmosphere...I get that everyone has to earn a living its too bad I can't get the menshkite experience I seek here....\n",
      "I recently moved to the area and tried out this place last month since yelpers had great things to say about it. The place was very clean and the guys were great, very friendly and entertaining and they offered everyone drinks. I don't remember what the gentleman's name was but he was on the far end. First of all, I'm Asian and I know my hair can be somewhat hard to cut sometimes. I asked him for a little bit off the top and a tight #1 faded up. Same thing I've gotten for years. I don't think the guy cutting my hair was licensed at all and had no idea how to cut my hair. When I asked for an inch off the length on top, he just took the clippers and shaved the top of my head all the same length. He never once touched a pair of scissors. No layering, no texturizing - just clippers. He did what you would do if you wanted a buzz cut: #1 guard on the clippers front to back all around my head. This is not how you cut hair - that's how you shave a head! When he saw me not liking what he was doing he kept repeating, \"don't worry, don't worry\". I was about ready to just get up and leave with my hair a mess (I should've). I left disgusted with my head looking horrible. I almost went somewhere else to have them fix it, but there really wasn't much hair left to do anything with. I feel bad for giving them a crappy review since all the guys were very nice and the shop is pretty sweet, but when it comes down to it, at least one of them doesn't know how to cut hair.\n",
      "Hands down the best barber shop in old town Scottsdale. The location may surprise you at first but don't let that fool you. If you have had a cut by these guys before you know how good they are and you also know that these guys love to talk and converse with their clientele. When I say converse, I mean anything and everything. Guys talk on overdrive! That being said, if your in need of a good, short, quick cut this is the place to go. Just make sure you bring your debit card because they do not take credit cards. Also, these guys are the masters of the guido/meat head cut. What I mean by that is they will cut down to the bone if necessary to get a close cut and make you look good. Everyone walks out looking like a good looking jarhead. So, if that's not your look go elsewhere. $20 for the cut and you have to pay in cash. No cc machine there. Tax reporting must be something I would never get involved with here.\n",
      "Awesome haircut. Boris really went out of his way to make sure I got the best treatment possible. I will gladly make the commute from Denver, CO for my haircut here!\n",
      "Just relocated, read some good things...exceeded expectations. To defend these guys on some of the posts I see below, there is some ball busting going on...welcome to a Mens barbershop...lol.... Rueben did a great job. Great to see someone take pride in the establishment as well. See ya next time.. Go CUBS!\n",
      "Every time I go here, the service is awesome and the environment is just so fun. This place makes you feel at home and the hair cuts are always on point. While people say it's a little pricey, the cost is on point for the professional service. I'm going to go there every time I need a hair cut and I know that I'm going to get some awesome service\n",
      "This is the best barber in all of Scottsdale. Boris and his staff are great at what they do and talking to them is pure entertainment. I have tried several other barbers since moving here and keep coming back to Shaving Grace. It is clean, the barbers are experienced, and they are flexible with appointments.\n",
      "WOW! These guys are GREAT! Eddie gave me a terrific haircut. I was in from NYC and needed a quick cut before the week started. Fantastic outcome and really friendly too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED from someone who usually goes to John Allan in NYC and Trueffitt & Hill in Chicago\n",
      "As per a friend's recommendation, who had been going here for 7+ years, I gave the shop a call. I hate getting my haircut because most of the places I've gone to have either been overpriced or just terrible at cutting my thick wavy hair. This has not been the case at this shop. I have never been more blown away by a barber than Boris. When it comes to expertise and talent, he has it all. I don't even have to ask him what to do, he just cuts my hair and it comes out fantastic. His experience shows in his speed, accuracy, and knowledge. The shop is clean, quaint, and classic. You walk in and are instantly greeted. It's a no bull atmosphere, complete with Frank Sinatra, a movie, or just hilarious conversation. It's what a good barbershop should be. I'm moving soon, and I'm frustrated that I'll have to, once again, find a barber. I doubt I'll find a place that will measure up to the experience this shop offers, and especially not at $19. Be a man, get your hair cut here.\n",
      "Best haircut in az. No more needs to be said. But yelp won't let me post unless it has more characters. Word. Word. More words. Word and word. Just go see Boris.\n",
      "I (and I'm willing to bet nearly everyone reading this) have been getting haircuts my entire life, and I've had bad ones, okay ones, and good ones. But the haircut I got at Shaving Grace was my first INCREDIBLE one. Every element of Shaving Grace Barbershop contributes to the great experience you'll have, starting with the atmosphere; when you walk in, it looks exactly like an old-school barbershop, with only 8-10 chairs, big mirrors framed in hardwood, and chairs with red leather seats - the only thing missing is the red and white striped pole! The employees were very friendly and there was a relaxed air, though they were still thoroughly professional. The haircut I got was, without exaggeration, the best I've ever had. Artie cut my hair and you could tell how skilled and practiced he was at his job - I was impressed by both his precision and his suggestions/execution. The haircut, hot towel, and a straight razor shave of my sideburns and the back or my neck was only $20, which I consider very reasonable. Be forewarned though: they only take cash! There's an ATM in the back of the shop that doesn't charge a fee. Overall, Shaving Grace Barbershop absolutely earned every one of its 5 stars. Any time I need a haircut and I'm in town, I'll be going there! I might consider flying back just for haircuts; that's how great this place is.\n",
      "Another visit to Shaving Grace and another win for the best shop in town. Had Rubin cut my hair and the guy just killed the game. Only place I will go to.\n",
      "I agree! This place is awesome! The group of guys and the setting make this the best place ever! Great for young and old. My son wears his hear longer and they did the coolest cut! He gets compliments! This barber shop is out of the movies or a story. The first time in I couldn't believe it was in Scottsdale. Boris works really hard at customer service and keeping his place so cool you are anxious to return. They give great cuts and you don't want to leave.\n",
      "Alex gave me the best haircut and beard trim I've ever had. These guys know what they're doing. $19 for a haircut and $10 for a beard trim and it was worth every penny.\n",
      "Great place to get a hair cut! I would definitely recommend to a friend.\n",
      "Literally the best haircut I've ever received. There was a new employee who initially starting cutting my hair, and she did a great job, but Boris was very attentive and made sure to check that she was cutting my hair properly. I felt like both Boris and the new employee actually cared about how I looked and Boris definitely takes pride in what he does. There's no better feeling than walking out of a barber shop with an amazing haircut. You literally cannot find a better deal than this place. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Boris and staff are fantastic! Quality haircuts for an awesome price. The staff at shaving grace truly get to know their clients, making it an easy and enjoyable experience. I've been returning to Shaving Grace Barber Shop every 5 weeks, and it's always job well done. They have a great vision for hair ideas and from time to time suggest ways to better your look. They are rapidly growing with new clientele so make sure you call ahead for an appointment.\n",
      "I'm as apprehensive as they come when it comes to letting new people cut up my hair but I decided to give this shop a try. They answered my call before it even rang once, told me they could take me as a walk in immediately, and followed through as promised. Immediately I felt like I was hanging out with my boys. Izzy took care of me and really gave me a style that I love. He took his time and walked me through his thoughts and opinion. I told him to do his thing and I'm glad I did. Stoked on how it came out, that's Cali talk for I'm happy if you read this Izzy. Thanks again man and see you soon.\n",
      "very nice ppl they have a great personality..best place in Scottsdale... This is one of the few places that actually cares about their customers highly recommend, I was extremely impressed with the level of customer service the first time I went in I immediately felt at home.\n",
      "I liked my haircut a lot but I did not really care for my barber telling me how much his clients usually tip him. I read all the reviews before I came here and it's definitely true that the people who work here have crude humor, so don't go if you're not OK with bad language and sometimes crude remarks. I'm no prude by any means but getting a haircut wasn't really the type of setting where I'd want to be in this environment. Boris and his staff who work there were totally nice but it's just not my style of someplace I'd want to continue going to get my haircut.\n",
      "Fantastic service , haircut is cut tonperfectiom, staff are very friendly and welcoming , special s/o to Gina !\n",
      "Wow! This place is absolutely phenomenal. I was out of town and only had my credit card on me (forgot debit) and they let me pay through Venmo. Absolutely great customer service, great hair cut, amazing ambiance. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Yes, the hype is true. This establishment's excellent level of service is only surpassed by the talent and dedication of the staff. Boris has perfected the art of making his customers feel at home, while ensuring there is a smooth pace of business throughout the busy day. Don't get me wrong, these are \"guys' guys\" we're talking. However, with their masculine and jovial banter, they are always sure to maintain professionalism and integrity. Thanks for the great barber shop!\n",
      "Shaving Grace took great care of me! Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Open on Sundays is a huge bonus!\n",
      "Aleksandr and the rest of the team go above and beyond from opening the door, delivering a great cut, shave, and conversation, to having you leave the shop with good feelings and vibe. Best barbers and great execution. Thanks guys!\n",
      "Don't believe Yelp reviews for Scottsdale haircuts. I've been to two of the top rated ones and both were horrible. This was by far the worst haircut I have had anywhere in the world. The shop itself is nice, but the atmosphere is horrible. Barbers are saying f*ck this and p&ssy that, completely disgusting and terribly unenjoyable. The barber didn't know what a layer cut was and took several tries to convince him to use scissors instead of a razor - and then he was a bit indignant that he was actually going to have to cut hair rather than just sheep shear it. Showed me the neckline when he was done and said \"see perfect\" and it looked like a picket fence. For $30, he didn't even dry my hair at the end. Just passed the blower over it once and said done. He didn't pay any attention to my hair when I arrived. At the end he combed it all forward with no part, instead of back with a part like when I arrived. Too busy talking about p&ssy to pay any attention. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Only good thing was no appointment needed and a short wait. Steer clear!\n",
      "I have nothing but great things to say about Shaving Grace. Boris is legit, and so is his staff. Great hair cuts Great shaves Great conversation. The only place I go..\n",
      "Top notch barber shop, I would never go anywhere else. It's walk in, I'm quick out the door, and always a good cut.\n",
      "Thank you, thank you, thank you! I brought my bf's dad here for a much needed haircut and premium shave. They paid extra careful attention to him and were so detailed and professional. He came out a new man! I will be bringing him back here for more pampering . Now I'm trying to get my boyfriend to go.\n",
      "When I know I have a trip to Scottsdale planned I wait and get a hair cut here. Eddy is old school. And his sons are just like him. You get your hair cut, razor to neck line and ears, trim eyebrows. Then comes the shoulder massage and hot towels to the face. Best ever.\n",
      "Im an out of towner! On short notice, I received an AWESOME haircut from a wonderful lady! Im sorry I forgot her name, but her cut and detail work were exemplary. She took the time to do it right without rushing. When in Scottsdale, I will definitely go to Shaving Grace, again. Nice haircuts, fair prices.\n",
      "If you want to be disrespected, wait an hour+, and receive crappy haircuts from half of the staff then this is the place for you. owner Boris is a complete a-hole. I came in regularly for months and typically tipped $10 on a $20 haircut, regardless of the quality, which varies widely among the barbers. I called in a Thursday at 2:45 pm. Assuming most people are at work, I asked if there was a wait if I came in soon. The owner told me to \"quit asking stupid questions and of course there was a wait.\" That's the last time I go in there. The guy in the 4th chair was hung over a couple of times I went in. The guy in the 3rd chair told me about how much money he made then kept asking me for higher tips. The guy in the 2nd chair showed me a video of a mouse tied up getting its penis cut off while I was getting a haircut (who also happens to be the best in the shop). The owner many times rushes through haircuts and thinks he's incredible and he can say anything he wants to his customers because there is such a large market.\n",
      "I have been getting my hair cut by Boris or his dad Eddie for the last 7 years. It is by far the best barbershop, with elite service, that I have ever been to. I travel all over the country for my profession and have never found any place close. As a matter of fact, If I know I'm heading out of town, I make sure to stop by and see them first as I have come to the conclusion that I'd rather not waste my time anywhere else..ever again. Your jokes are welcome here. No one in the shop takes themselves too seriously, unless we are talking about the quality of the haircut. This is my first ever review and I saved it for the one thing I know I can consistently count on..a great haircut and experience at Shaving Grace.\n",
      "I moved to Scottsdale and was looking for a place to get my hair cut like I did back home. I was referred to Shaving Grace by a friend and decided to give it a shot. I've gotten my hair cut there now a few times by Alex and Gina and the amount of precision they both put into the job has been fantastic. Boris runs a really solid shop that's friendly and comfortable. They're very detailed, make sure you look good and are very flexible with their scheduling. I don't see myself getting my hair cut anywhere else in Scottsdale going forward.\n",
      "I hate leaving negative reviews. But my experience was less then to be desired. Walked in asked if I wanted a hair cut I said yes. Then was told a story about the guy they made wait 2 1/2 hours just to tell him that they don't cut \"faggots\" hair. With the justification of \"you know we're old school guys, my father is. Huh ok. Then I sat down told him the hair cut I wanted gladly obliged. Then half way though was told it was an \"abomination of a hair style and to not tell people I received it from him. But to say I asked for it. Ok thanks for that. Finished up. Tipped him six on a 19 dollar cut. Change from 40 was in 5's. Thanks for that and left. Needless to say. I won't be making a return trip. Thanks guys. P.s Constructive criticism \"bro\" with you and your company. Mind your P's and Q's. Funny guy.\n",
      "I have worked in the area for over a year now and visited Shaving Grace Barber Shop for the first time today. My experience was awesome. I have been looking for a real barbershop for awhile and little did I know there was one within walking distance. I was greated as soon as I walked in and everyone was very friendly, definitely my kind of place. I read other reviews that were posted on Yelp and all I can say is you can't please everyone. Some people are just unhappy. Thank guys, I will be return in a couple of weeks when I need a trim! Rick the Happy Camper\n",
      "I've been going to Borris and Shaving Grace for three years now and every time I go the cut gets better. I have never walked out of the shop unhappy. If you come to this shop one time you'll never go to another barber again!\n",
      "I really like haircut and the service you receive from Eddie and the guys. Top notch, old style type of shop that is very welcoming.\n",
      "Boris and the crew are great ! Every barber is very talented and it is always very clean.\n",
      "This spot is one of the best in town. Really good tapers and fades, and they use a straight edge for perfect lines. Make sure you specify exactly what you want, as they take pride in their work.\n",
      "Boris rocks! Good haircuts from some friendly people at this joint near Miller and Camelback.\n",
      "Stanley cut my hair and Boris cut my sons. Both great cuts. Cash only. ATM in the back of the shop. I'm picky about my haircuts and these guys delivered on the first visit. Boris is pretty busy but he seems to surround himself with good barbers. The banter gets lively, but me and my 8 year old son got a kick out of it. Bottom line, great guys, great business, go check it out.\n",
      "My son arrived in AZ with a face full of beard--good and not so good. The Shaving Grace crew did an awesome job cleaning him up just in time for his sister's wedding. They were wonderful, friendly, and comical all at the same time. Loved their East Coast accents and humor. I highly recommend this place!!!\n",
      "Alex gave my 4 yr old a great haircut today! He was so patient with him when he was scared and I appreciated that even though my son was being squirmy at times, he still gave him an excellent cut and made it fun for him as well! Will definitely be bringing him back, thanks Alex for making this a good experience for my son! :)\n",
      "Barish & all the crew at Shaving Grace do an amazing job! They're fast, funny, awesome to chat with, extremely affordable, make you feel relaxed, & obviously REALLY AWESOME at their craft. BEST HAIRCUTS IN THE VALLEY! Believe me, I've tried them all & no one does full service barber shop services like all the guys at Shaving Grace. Whether it's a simple/quick haircut or a full service/relaxing cut, shave, etc - THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU! My latest barber, Barish, was new but my first cut with him was great! He was fast, extremely TALENTED, & awesome to talk to. And if you have the time, you gotta try the full service treatment!!! There's nothing like a hot shave, warm towel, shoulder massage, & full treatment like Shaving Grace offers to relax you & make all of life's stresses melt away! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN AWESOME/YET AFFORDABLE BARBER, LOOK NO FURTHER!\n",
      "I've been telling Boris I would write him a review for awhile now. Here goes: I show up for my haircut late while Boris talks shit to me and continues to eat his bacon and eggs out of a stirofoam box. My fault I am 5 minutes late BUT I was happy to let him stuff his face before he cut my brillo patch. After all, he works really hard cutting hair all day long. Often I wonder how he cuts his own hair but oddly enough the poor bastard doesn't have any. You bald dick, you. Getting to the point Shaving Grace is a great place to go. They always have a story that will make you laugh and they usually don't screw up on the whole hair cutting part either. But, let's be honest Boris - you got nothing on Eddie when it comes to cutting my Jew fro.\n",
      "I'm from New York, so I'm used to seeing art and life everywhere ..and hair is an art, if done right, it allows you to live, and feel good about yourself. Let me just say.. this place has some talented artists, and with their scissors and machines being their paintbrush, they make you look and feel like a masterpiece.. I highly recommend Ruben, he's an outstanding barber! He studies the texture and sees the potential of ones hair. He has a good eye and works from the heart. He's a really good guy. Be aware of the barber Boris.. He's like that Axe commercial.. get your haircut by him, and the ladies will be all over you ;) lol The shop is great, the Barbers are all gifted with the art of cutting, so what are you waiting for? Book your appointment at Shaving Grace Barber Shop!!\n",
      "The moment you walk in you are instantly greeted by the staff. The owner boris will do a great job making you feel comfortable and introduces himself right away. First impression it is a really clean place. Looks classy and simple. Love the atmosphere. Makes you feel like your back in NY. I got cut up by Simon. Simon was very professional. He is very detail oriented and customer service focused. We had a good conversation and shared a few laughs. Beside the haircut you get a straight blade edge up and a hot towel but it doesn't end with the towel you get a massage as well. All in all an awesome shop with friendly barbers. Highly record if your in the Scottsdale area that you give this place a shot.\n",
      "If your searching for a TRUE barbershop look no further Shaving Grace is the spot for you. Boris and his team of barbers are highly skilled and knowledgeable in the art of cutting hair. I've been a customer for the past 8+ years. Boris is very accommodating and always takes care of his customers. Disclaimer- The shop is cash only and is strict about No Shows or tardiness.\n",
      "Best customer service and best hair cut and shave I've ever had. Boris is a true business owner who cares about all of his customer...great personality and great guy!!! There is a reason why EVERYONE gives this place 5 stars!\n",
      "Got a haircut from Izzy today and dude knows what he is doing. Nice spot. If you guys need somebody that knows how to cut hair, Izzy is ur man.\n",
      "Had such a wonderful experience here. I am from out of town was able to quickly make an appointment. I got a haircut and a shave and both were performed with amazing precision. The fade is definitely as good as I have ever had. This was the first professional shave I've ever gotten. I was very happy with the final result...not a single hair left on my face...so smooth! I would highly recommend it here and can't wait until I travel back to town here again. Thanks so much\n",
      "My new local spot! I am very particular on my hair cuts and used to make a bit of a drive to get what I wanted. Not any more. These guys know there stuff and take their time which is most important to me. Classy joint and good humor in here. Thx.\n",
      "BEST hair cut in Scottsdale! If you want a nice clean professional cut, this is the place. I highly recommend.\n",
      "Best Barber shop in Scottsdale, hands down. Boris and his crew always do top-notch work, and they're funny, as well.\n",
      "I've never been to a shop like Shaving Grace. The second time I went the owner Boris remembered me even though a month passed since my first visit. The shop isn't by my house and I pass other barbershops on my way to Shaving Grace but I return. Your hair will look great, you'll have to find someone else to fix your face .\n",
      "This is a no frills, frills barbershop. And what I mean by that is this place is nice, upscale, clean and very organized. But their personalities is like a old school barbershop that doesn't hold back, which I personally love. They make it super entertaining and time flies by. I have seen then do cuts on various people when I wait and when I am getting my hair did, and they are pretty damn good. I've been to about 6 other barbers the past few years and as long as Boris is still cutting hair I will be going to him. Don't let the \"barbershop\" title scare you, they don't just do fades, I had long hair before I decided to cut it off and they were able to do some good cuts with long hair too. Also these other reviews about how they talk or act and how they are offended, like give me a break. Most of you were probably held too much as a child or not enough. It's a barbershop, yea they speak another language so what, how else would they talk sh!t about a complaining customer, jk of course =D. Bring cash, if you don't have it they have a a.t.m. in the back.\n",
      "Once again Boris and his crew have gone above and beyond. I brought my twin boys in a few weeks ago for haircuts, and describing them as ferrell animals is being kind. Boris handled them like a true pro and gave each an outstanding haircut. I've said it before, but it bears repeating- this is the ONLY barber shop for me and my boys.\n",
      "This place is a gem. A bunch of hilarious guys, cracking jokes and happen to give incredible haircuts and shaves. One of the best haircuts I've gotten (and I'm usually weary of barber shops) let alone for $19. These guys genuinely care about their clients and do a great job. I will be back.\n",
      "I've never been to a barber shop before (I've always just gone to a GreatClips/SuperCuts etc), so I was a bit nervous and hesitant about going to a barber shop. That being said, I am never going back to a GreatClips/SuperCuts. Shaving Grace is my go to from now on. The staff are all friendly, very jovial. Alex cut my hair, and did an exceptional job. Very skilled at his art. They ran out of some product that I needed for my hair, and Boris hooked me up with some from his work counter. Exceptional service. Chill vibe and non-threatening atmosphere. Great end result. This will be my regular spot. Go check them out.\n",
      "Your boy coming atcha once again getting a cut and cut. That's a cut from Boris the blade the we go get a cut of steak for dinner. That's that next level shit you wouldn't know about that. If you're a tool don't come here. Go get a cut by a person dressed liked a referee. If you're a G, pick up the phone and get your A game on at shaving grace.\n",
      "I called the barbershop on a Friday afternoon hoping to get in on Saturday, and Boris answered the phone. He was very friendly and told me I could get in no problem so I booked an appointment to get a shave. I arrived about 10 minutes early and was greeted and offered a chair to wait. I was in the barber chair minutes later and after a quick goatee trim, the barber reclined me in the barber chair and went to work. He lathered me up nice and thick with warm shaving cream from an old school lather machine and placed the hot towels. He came back and lathered me up again and started the shave. He had me in the barber chair for at least 40 minutes and gave me the best shave I have ever had!! The shave was $29 and I gave him $40 for a well deserved good tip, but will definitely give him $50 when I go back in a week for another shave. Comfy old school barber chairs, great atmosphere, cool barbers and awesome conversation. I'll be back every week!!!\n",
      "This place is awesome. Great service, good price. Really fun atmosphere. Definitely going back.\n",
      "I having been coming to the shop since the day it open. Best haircut in town and continues to impress every time I get a cut. I will never go anywhere else. Boris makes sure every customer is satisfied and happy with their cut or shave before they leave. I have recommended multiple people and all have nothing but great things to say about the way they are treated and the hair cut they received.\n",
      "I was introduced to this place when I was apart of a wedding party and we all got a haircut and shave on the big day. I really liked the haircut I got and have been coming back since. These guys take their time and do a great job. I definitely recommend this place\n",
      "The guys here are great, the shop is kept clean, and they do a good job. I just don't think it was worth what they are charging. I get my hair cut on an average of once every 1 1/2 weeks. I just moved down here to Arizona and based on the reviews, went here first. The guys were friendly and very professional. The first time I went I asked them to just trim a little off the top and for a medium fade, and I stressed the \"little\" part. I wasn't happy with the end result, but it was too late, it was already too short. I should have known the size I needed to be more specific, so it's not completely their fault. I gave them another chance and was happier the second time. I wasn't, however, happy with the price. No military discount either (not that I expect it). I now to go to a different barber shop in Tempe that does just as good of a job, if not better for about half the price. (and they still use the straight razor for trimming). So all thing considered, this is a good barber shop if the high price doesn't bother you. I'm only giving it three stars because of that. It's not like i'm getting my hair styled.. it's just a medium fade...\n",
      "These guys are the best. Came into AZ from CA for Business and looked them up. Heard nothing but good things so i had to try them out myself. WOW!!!! Was i amazed! When i told them the BEST haircut and line-up ever...I MEANT IT! Had the pleasure of meeting Boris, but the best haircut experience with my man Ruben who hooked it up. Definitely be back for sure! Keep it up guys. Best of Luck!\n",
      "My first experience was excellent, the gentlemen was friendly and made efforts to cut my hair right and made great suggestions. The 2nd and third time was not so pleasant. The guy who cut my hair was sick and you don't want someone sick cutting your hair, you could hear him cough and spit from the other room when he took a short break to relief himself. *update from the owner of the shop* (He told me that he just had bad allergies and wasn't sick. He said that he has a background in nursing and he can assure me that in fact he wouldn't let sick people work at his shop.) I asked him about his day and he started talking passionately about his life but wasn't focused enough on cutting my hair. Since I didn't remember how short I wanted my hair the guy told me for next time to remember how short it was and telling me how I should remember not to waste his time. Which I thought was rude. Also this may or may not annoy you but they talk Russian between each other all the time which of course clients and I don't understand. The atmosphere is friendly and very easy going, maybe a little too easy going.\n",
      "Finally, a place I can get my haircut knowing that it's gonna look good every time. You can tell these guys love what they do and they look at being a barber as a craft not a job. More people should take pride in their work like Shaving Grace. Keep up the good work!\n",
      "I always love finding a good place to get a haircut and Shaving Grace is as good as it gets. Opened for only about six months and located very close to my office, Shaving Grace has the feel of an old school barbershop with the modern day class and style of today. Boris took care of my hair and made it look great, he's also a good guy to talk with. The haircut, the conversation, the hot towel, and the shoulder rub at the end were all excellent and I walked out both looking and feeling great. Shaving Grace is a great new addition to modern barbershops in the Valley and one to which I will definitely be returning. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I'm going to keep this short and simple. BEST BARBER SHOP IN THE VALLEY! I drive 30min to get there! It's worth it!Everyone is super talented! I've never had a bad experience. I highly recommend Shaving Grace! Trust me when I say you won't find better! It's the only place I will go from here on out!\n",
      "If you need a haircut, you need to come see Boris and his crew. Very cool old school barber shop. If Boris, Ruben, or one of the other guys isn't cutting your hair, you're doing it wrong\n",
      "I have been going to Shaving Grace for almost 3 years now. I can honestly say they give the best haircut in Scottsdale, and at an affordable price. Boris could charge a lot more for the quality you end up receiving every single time. He will make sure that if any of his barbers mess up, that it gets fixed. I've got a haircut from most of the barbers who work there and you really can't go wrong with any of them. If you're looking for a new place to get your hair cut, this is where you need to go.\n",
      "These guys have been cutting my hair for the better part of the last two years and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else. As a New York guy myself the shop feels exactly like my old shop at home. Even when you're waiting and its busy, Boris keeps the humor flowing and the time flies by. These guys make getting a haircut into an event. I'm usually in every other week and Boris, Reuben and Alex have all cut my hair and it's perfect every time. I also wouldn't have an issue having anyone else cut me either because Boris only keep A+ barbers in his shop. Reuben is my regular barber and doesn't even need to ask what I want anymore he just gets to work and I don't need to say a word. These guys are the real deal and if you're looking for a great haircut and comedy hour this is your spot. Took me about 6 months to find them but haven't seen anyone else since. Keep up the great work guys!\n",
      "Great haircut and beard trim for a good price. Friendly staff, and relaxed environment. I'll be a return customer.\n",
      "Thought this review is not about me, I need to mention that I have been to barbers all around the world and at least 20 different US cities (many in Scottsdale included). In addition, I have been in the professional beauty industry for 25 plus years.. Trust me, with a terrible neckline and grey, course hair, I know for sure, these guys know what they are doing. If you have discriminating tastes in the art of an 'old school' barber experience with a blend of youthful (sometimes wonderfully off-color) banter and a comfortable, masculine modern motif, Shaving Grace could be your new second home. Boris the owner has been cutting my hair for one and a half years and I am already looking for a plan B for when he retires in 30 or so years... If you walk in and feel the vibe of a cool joint with ridiculously low prices ($19 for a true full service) and feel at home, I promise you will keep coming back. If you want a beauty salon, \"make me look pretty and I am a diva\" haircut, please go somewhere else so I can keep my 3 week ritual visit without you being in the way... See you there!\n",
      "Showed up very early on a Sunday morning. Only place thats open so early and that fits perfectly with my schedule. Got a cut with Boris. Great place with TV's in each barber station and old school barber chairs, I really felt comfortable here. Great attention to detail and focused on service. Looking forward to my next cut in a few weeks.\n",
      "I took my 2 young sons in for haircuts today. What an awesome experience. Boris is so funny and engaging and the shop is cool and a place that guys obviously enjoy patronizing. The barber who cut my sons' hair did a great job. I loved it and will definitely be back when we come to Scottsdale.\n",
      "Been there a few times now always quick to sit down and they do a great job. Will continue going there for my haircuts!\n",
      "Always great service. I can always count on these guys to fit me into their busy schedule and they have all the services you'd expect from a barber shop.\n",
      "Been here at least twice a month for the last 3 years. When I moved away I would even fly back for my haircut. Don't waste your money anywhere else. These guys get the job done.\n",
      "Been in there twice now and I have to say I've been pretty happy with my cuts. It's always busy in there the times I've been but they don't take long to get to you. I recommend this place if your in need of a solid cut!\n",
      "Not all barber shops are created equal! Shaving Grace is the barber shop of barber shops. I would challenge anyone to tell me where you can get a better haircut in the valley. It's the complete package, You sit in an old fashioned, reconditioned barber char, the haircut is not rushed, it is precise and treated like a work of art, followed by a straight edge razor shave with a steaming hot towel and old fashioned Pinaid \"Clubman\" barber shop after shave to soothe your face, then finished off with a relaxing shoulder massage. In true barber shop fashion, the conversation is as good as the haircut. Eddie, Borris and Anthony have solved all of the worlds problems (especially Borris) and are eager to share that with you. They are all just great guys. I always have a good laugh when I'm there. I look forward to my visits with these guys every few weeks. On a side note, I started going to these guys more than seven years ago at their old location. Borris and Eddie would cut my hair then. When I was there they told me about their cousin Anthony who had a Gyro restaurant (Shish Kabobs) in the same mall. I became a regular there as well. Anthony recently sold the restaurant and got his license to cut hair. He is now cutting hair at the barber shop too. Anthony has cut my hair twice. His haircuts are as good as his Gyro sandwiches and they were the best in town! Shaving Grace, Great Haircut! Great Guys! Great Entertainment! Great Value!\n",
      "Been going to Shaving Grace for a little over a year now...I've yet to be disappointed. Whether it's been Boris, Reuben or someone else, I'm walking out with a nice cut (and shave when I have time). I will be back for sure...\n",
      "I've been going here for about a year now and had to make sure they got the 5 stars they deserve! I read some of the negative reviews, but in person I've never seen anyone upset with what they got. I would also like to mention this is an old style barber so you get exactly what you should expect from one and more.\n",
      "Staff is fantastic. Boris and the crew have it down to a science. Only have had positive experiences here!\n",
      "Well I don't know where to begin. I moved from the Washington, D.C. Area year ago, and I'm by far the pickiest you will ever meet. I can not write enough to express how amazing this barber shop Is. As an openly gay male they treat everyone as an equal. The owner has a close family member Chris who works at the shop and helps run the every business for the owner but also doubles as a barber himself. I can ensure you hands down you will never meet a group of people that are so welcoming and kinds as the staff at this shop. I was clunky and blessed to have found a shop like this... I make sure I attended this shop weekly for a cut and each week I laugh more and more. For a gale male it's amazing to find such a welcoming group of people than the staff at mikes barbershops!! I've never felt so welcome and love in my life!! This is a must go to place no matter where your located!!!!\n",
      "Top notch service, long line for a Sunday and I know why. Great atmosphere with hilarious conversations. These guys are awesome! I'll be back!!\n",
      "there are a lot of barber shops in phx and scottsdale, but you will never find one like this. very outgoing barbers. you come in,boris greets you with hi, someone will help you.every single time you come in. been coming here for over 2 years, boris and reuben, and the other guys, are top notch!!!!!!!!!! give them a try, really that good.\n",
      "If you are reading this review because you are planning to eat sushi alone, look elsewhere. I am not reviewing the sushi! I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks). This place is tolerable if you want ramen. However, I cannot say anything of the sushi. I am not a big fan of sushi since I can only eat the non-shellfish variety. The atmosphere is lovely, the waiters are polite, and the service is bearable.\n",
      "Sometimes you need some sushi, some beer, and some good conversation. A buddy and I met up on a Friday for HH at this jumpin' joint. We both wanted a cocktail but forgot they were BYO. My friend went across the street and got beer and sake. We made sake bombs and they were fantastic! Between us, we ordered yellowtail sashimi, yellowtail roll, tempura vegetables, and a salmonskin roll. The fish was great, really fresh tasting. The ratio of rice to sushi was perfect. I was glad to see that they have added outdoor seating. This offers another option for diners who want to enjoy the weather and a much quieter dining experience. The best part of the evening was getting the check! We ate well for under $50, an amazing feat for ANY meal, let alone sushi. I will definitely be returning soon....good thing they're in the neighborhood!\n",
      "If you have more than 2 people then don't show up hungry. We had a group of 3 and the hostess put our name on the waiting listing. At the time there was not enough spots to sit at the sushi bar. When enough seats for 3 did open up at the bar the hostess sat 2 people who had just arrived. When asked why we did not get the option to sit at the bar the hostess shrugged us off. The food was not good enough to overcome the bad start. I didn't feel that the staff was friendly or rude. They seemed busy like worker ants.\n",
      "Okay, reading reviews of Hana's; maybe I'm not an expert...Just know what I like. I love Hana Japanese Eatery. The poke is something I must get everytime. The specials on the board are always great to try. The staff is always accomodating. This \"sansei\" will be back again & again...\n",
      "We ordered Edamame, Spicy Tuna Roll, Scallop Dynamite Roll (crab and scallops baked with a spicy sauce on top served without rice) and Ebi Yakisoba (pan fried shrimp, vegetables and noddles presented on a cast iron plate). I was satisfied with everything. Our waitress was very helpful, explaining what all the specials were and offering her recommendations. For dessert, we ordered strawberry mochi, deep fried. It was so yummy! It's a little on the expensive side, so be prepared. And they don't offer any type of happy hour. This is an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant, not your typical Scottsdale sushi spot. I'll be back, but it will have to be for a special occasion.\n",
      "Hana Japanese Eatery = Super-Awesome 5-Star Joint. 1. Freshest fish in Phoenix. The sashimi and nigiri are remarkable in texture and taste. So good, in fact, that each bite makes the lucky biter pause and savor. I almost died without their salmon and tuna nigiri when I was preggers. (And maybe I snuck a piece or two, but don't tell.) 2. Fantastic Japanese dishes rare enough that you won't find them in other sushi restaurants. Be daring and explore uncommon foods off their specials board. I've never been grossed out, only happily wowed, even when a whole fish, with skin on, arrived in front of us on one occasion. Seriously, it was great. 3. REAL wasabi if you ask for it. (Did you know that paste is not wasabi's natural state when observed in the wild?) 4. BYOB. It's fun! BYOS (sake) for even more fun. 5. Great atmosphere: Not a hole-in-the-wall, yet not so trendy that they blare the club jamz and that the waitresses are all augmented. 6. Locally owned. 7. Attentive service! Sometimes sassy service! Go there! Eat fish!\n",
      "I was really excited to try Hana after reading all the great reviews. I will not say that it was a disappointment, that would be unfair, because I really did like Hana. I tend to be turned off by the slick over-styled sushi restaurants of Scottsdale, so I was immediately charmed by the homey neighborhood feel of Hana. And the sushi was good. Not the best I have ever had, but solid. And who knows, maybe I didn't order well? One can never tell. I also must disclose that I went with my ex-boyfriend. I'm sure this influenced my perception in some way. He has issues with \"personal space\", so being at the end of a crowded sushi bar with a server reaching over us, which I must admit was in poor form (the serve could have easily taken two more steps to the edge of the bar instead of reaching over our heads) was not ideal. Plus, I was out to dinner with my ex-boyfriend. Need I say more? This is never advisable. I may need to go back another night to sample the fare under more favorable conditions. We shall see.\n",
      "This is definitely a place that I WISH would move to a larger location so that more patrons can sit inside. They have a bizarre seating rule which I think others have posted about on here and it's true. The best time to arrive is right when they open. That way, you are guaranteed a seat. The place is very small and dark. Their food is absolutely incredible though. My favorite, hands down, was the lobster roll. Quite pricey, but SO worth it. I preferred a California roll from here and loved the flaming sugar cube that accompanied it. Very cool to watch. I'm dying to return here soon.\n",
      "I absolutely adore this place. It's cozy, mom n pop, non corporate fun! My complete favorite roll is the baked salmon and I don't even really like salmon. It's so tasty as is the Vegas roll and their steaks, which is not something I generally go to a sushi place for but if they got it... You do have to bring your own wine, saki, beer but that also means you don't have to pay marked up prices and you get exactly what you want. Getting blind drunk is not what this place is about however, it's all about the food. Give it a try if Zen 32 is boring you.\n",
      "The service was excellent. It was very busy so we opted to sit outside. It's byob so that was disappointing. The food was ok. It was certainly edible and the presentation was nice. It just wasn't awesome.\n",
      "I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner. I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef. So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight! Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment. However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana. Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA. For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix. I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning. Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint. My second experience was quite a bit different. I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists. For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming. They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each. One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar. Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping. (It made me cry, it was so delicious.) A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth. (And I cried again.) There was no sushi on our table. That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish! A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish. (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.) Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on. The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar. And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven. So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind: Walk into Nana. Ask for Lori, the owner. Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you. Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200. Tell Lori to show you something amazing. Forget about the menu. Let the experts decide for you. Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day. Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame. There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen. It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll! I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.\n",
      "Once you have dined at Hana, the experience will prompt you to return sooner then you thought. Hana is well established mom-n-pop place which serves the fresh sushi items, friendly and attentively services, and BYOB as you please. The price is most reasonable. Sushi dining can be a great experience, especially when you dine at Hana's. I have been enjoying sushi dining for many years, in-and-out of phoenix, but I can always count on this place. Thumbs up!\n",
      "Went in with high expectation and left dissatisfied. Ordered the Beni-Hana (9pieces of nigiri, spicy tuna and tempura) miso soup and a volcano roll with a side of avocado. 1) they charge $2.00 extra for the teeny tiny avocado pieces on the side 2) The service was terrible. Our order wasn't complete and when we asked for a side of fresh wasabi, it never came around. 3) The sushi grade was okay.... Definitely not a 4/5 star restaurant. I will continue my hunt for the best sushi spot in Phoenix\n",
      "Pretty good. The staff was super friendly. I liked their baked rolls A bit on the pricy side, but its a good treat for payday.\n",
      "I first learned of Hana from a friend of mine, but could never have the sense to say the name of it when asked out to lunch by random friends posing the age-old question \"Where do you want to go to lunch?\" Today, I remembered to say it. I'm going to call this part one of the review. Today was my first visit to Hana. The second part will be tacked on at some later date and this is why: THEY WEREN'T SERVING SUSHI. No. Really. Srsly. Being a brand new restaurant, apparently only one person (the server called him the \"Sushi Rock Star\") has been employed behind the counter rolling up sushi! I hope Hana can audition some more rock stars because I am anxious to audition a tuna roll. The pork ramen had to suffice and it was served in a mammoth bowl at a temperature not unlike our galaxy's sun. After about 10 minutes, it had cooled off to the point where I could taste it and it was very good! Much better than those 73 for $1 jobbies at the grocery store. The atmosphere was dark, and facing the door it was a bit distracting. It was kind of like being in a dark, seedy bar and having someone stand there with the door open... I imagine. The service was excellent and the server friendly. I felt sorry for him having to tell subsequent customers that they weren't serving sushi. It's kind of like going to a luxury car dealership and being told they only have Yugos. But hey... even rock stars need a day off.\n",
      "I heard this place was great so I wanted to try it. Maybe this is a one off but it was a horrendous experience: I called ahead for pick up- though I had given enough time they were still very late (talking 25 minutes real time here) getting it to me. I drove home realized they had given me the wrong order so I went back, the manager wanted the Ngiri I was given by mistake back, to give to another person after it had been in my possession for a good 40 minutes. Gave it back of course, just thought it's weird. And guess what they made me wait another 20 minutes even though I had called when I got home and realized it was the wrong order. Really a bummer because I wanted to try this place and have what otherwise seems a good place for sushi according to most people.\n",
      "I had Maguro teriyaki yesterday. It was very good. Their teriyaki sauce is not too thick or too heavy like some other places which smother your food with the sauce. Hana puts just the right amount and they mix it with something so that it comes out right. Very beautiful food presentation. At atmostphere is very classy. The waitress is very nice and attentive and polite. The best Japanese restautant so far in Phoenix.\n",
      "We were Friday about 5:30. It was fairly slow so our food came out rather quickly. Everything we had was good. We will return.\n",
      "This is a belated review, but reviewing the other ones, I can see I'm not alone in my absolute disappointment for this place. We were a party of 2, and I had the dish with the buckwheat noodles. I wanted to try them. When the male server (probably the same notorious dark haired one found in other reviews) came by to ask me how it was, I said I didn't like it. He said, \"you're weird\" and walked away. Who says to their customer they are weird?? I'm supporting this business by coming in here. I'm paying your salary (in part). But apparently it doesn't matter because this place is still in business. Didn't hurt them any when I didn't come back. I also didn't take leftovers home. Obviously no tip. They were lucky I paid the bill. Anyone can do better than plunking down $40 here.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite spots to go for sushi or really any Japanese food. Their ramen is delicious. This place is BYOB which makes it a fun place to go with a group. Just keep in mind it gets busy so if you're group is too large and it's a weekend, you might have a wait. Good thing you can drink and wait! I have yet to try anything on this menu that was bad. Don't forget to hit up their specials -- always a treat!\n",
      "Best sushi I've had no doubt....and I've been to a lot of sushi places. Great atmosphere, very fresh, welcoming, and I have to come back soooooon. Favorites are octopus salad, yellowtail roll, and caterpillar roll\n",
      "Love the GyodonNabe special. Sooo tasty. I want more. Beef. Tofu. Mushrooms. Cabbage in a delicious savory broth with rice on the side.\n",
      "I kept hearing about how good this place was and with such a limited amount of sushi restaurants nearby, my husband and I decided to try it. We went on the Friday before Labor Day, so when we first walked in it was pretty slammed. It looked as if the small restaurant was overwhelmed with the fast paced staff, so we were a little worried about the service. It turned out we had nothing to be worried about, the service was great! We ordered the yellow tail nigiri, salmon skin roll and ebi yakisoba. The fish in the sushi was high quality and very fresh tasting (for Arizona). I don't normally order hot food, but decided to venture out and it was well worth it. The ebi yakisoba was very good, with shrimp that was marinated and cooked very well, and vegetables that were fresh and crunchy. I will definitely return.\n",
      "BYOB and you can get a flaming boat of sushi?! #winning This is an awesome neighborhood place with reasonable prices and delicious menu options. Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems. I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun.\n",
      "I can't believe Mike O. has 111 check ins at Hana. Not only does he have the dukedom! Hana should have a chair with his name on it. Wow! I seriously cannot claim having been to any one restaurant over 100 times! So this place must be good if Mike O. Is such a loyal, regular costumer. He must roll out of bed and saunter right into Hana! Oh wait, this review is suppose to be about MY experience at Hana. Well, I have to concur with Mike O. This place serves some darn good food. Not just sushi, the cooked varieties too. I've always liked eating here. Sushi is fresh, cooked items full of flavor. I don't always check-in when I eat here but doesn't matter, I don't think anyone is about to take the dukedom away from Mike O. !\n",
      "Friendly staff and delicious food at a reasonable price. Just had a terrific date night with the boyfriend here. Always enjoy going out to dinner and having perfect customer service. Very friendly waitress, food came out quick and dishes we were finished with were taken away as soon as we had the last bite which I love because I hate a cluttered dining table when I eat out. We ordered a little too much because everything looked so good, but that's more of a observation than a complaint. Definitely one of those places I'd recommend to others without hesitation. Just a tip. If alcohol is your thing, bring your own, as they don't serve any. Didn't bother me though I'll just remember for next time.\n",
      "I just ate here for lunch with a friend, and we both very much enjoyed our food. I had a Bento box and he had the shrimp tempura. Not the cheapest placed to eat lunch, but, the service was good and I he tuna I had was quite good as well.\n",
      "love it love it love it!!!!! Best sushi ever!!!!!! We get great service, great food, in a quaint little spot. We always enjoy coming to Hanas! :)\n",
      "This is my new favorite sushi place in the valley. Every single time I've gone (and I've gone a lot in the past few years) it's been fresh and delicious. The variety of rolls is great too for those who don't like traditional sushi. The service is always great. I've never had a bad experience. It's small and sometimes it's super busy but service and quality never suffer. I do wish they served beer and sake but that's my only complaint (and very minor at that as you can always bring your own!).\n",
      "I love this place. Its BYOB, the waiters are friendly, the owners are greats. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh! Like your sitting at a beach front restuarant in Phoenix. I was so so on Sushi until I found Hana. I recommend Hana over and over as the place to go, and every one that goes is estatic. The place is tiny but there is a patio area and also a bar counter which helps!\n",
      "I must say this is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix...period. The spicy tuna roll had so much flavor to it, and the squid salad was superb. The place is small but has a quaint atmosphere. The place doesn't serve alcohol, but it is a BYOB.\n",
      "I've had both great and sub-par experiences here so I gave it the middle of the road rating. The first time I was here, I was blown away by how different the sushi was and how they had things no other sushi bars seemed to have in Arizona. The next 3 times I went back, Sunday, Sunday, and Friday back to back, I've been noticing things that I did not notice the first time. First, I would like to say that I believe that a waiter/waitress should not wear cologne/perfume. I did not notice it the first time I went, but every other time, I noticed the guy bringing the sushi literally bathes in the stuff. I'm about to eat a bite out of my 10$ per serving of Monkfish liver and catching a big wiff of [insert popular brand of men's cologne here] is not appetizing. Especially since smell is so heavily associated with taste. A very big faux pas in my book. After the great experience the first time, a few months later, I went 3 times in a row... back to back Sundays and Friday, I was able to notice that their specials didn't change in that time frame. The chef's-here's-a-little-something-extra-you-didn't-order was the exact same also. Maybe it's just me but I know a lot of places change their specials at least once a week. How is the special still fresh if I see it every time I go? I know the special is still there because they have not sold it out yet. You know? Also, their tempura is really sub-par in my book. I know it's pretty hard to not have good shrimp tempura, but it's really blah. I've been able to taste it every single time I went there (it comes out as a side to a lot of noodle dishes such as udon and soba) but it tastes really floury and oily, and it's pretty heavy, batter-wise. Shrimp tempura should be very light, almost an airy crisp, but not here. My fellow diners were all in surprised agreement their tempura really was pretty blah. Also, if you really like the tempura sauce other places have; the warm savory dipping broth other places have with grated daikon radish, don't expect it here. You gotta use your soy sauce. :( Their cold soba noodles are very salty. I've had to ask for a glass of ice and literally had to use the entire cup to dilute it enough to tolerate the saltiness. The praises of this place come from the type of sushi you cannot find elsewhere. I love the saba here, which is Mackerel. Other places usually take the easy route and marinate it in the pickled ginger juice or their own vinegar marinade, but this place really serves the raw stuff. Very good. A must try in my book. Sometimes Hana has monkfish liver, which is hard to find elsewhere. It's better than uni (Sea urchin gonads) and literally the foie gras of the sea. Very similar in texture and taste. Mmmm... So good!!! Better than the average sushi bar, but a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way and therefore brought my rating down to 3 stars.\n",
      "Went here for lunch after moving from this part of town. Food is still awesome and fresh. Everyone was very friendly. I am glad I went back and was reminded of how good this place is.\n",
      "Nice looking little place. We were promptly seated, but the service was a bit slow as the evening progressed. The diners who had brought their own beer/wine seemed to receive better service. All three of us ordered ice green tea and were surprised to receive cans instead of brewed. I honestly thought the waitress was surprised at us ordering it. We ordered a variety of items, including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri. The sushi we had was very fresh, and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had. The rolls in general were a bit losely made, and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion: there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites, so it kind of ruined the concept of a \"roll\". While nothing was bad per se, there wasn't really anything special that inspired me to want to return, and the prices were really high. I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants. We didn't bother with deserts with Mary Coyle's Ice Cream Parlor being directly across the street.\n",
      "Yay for Hana! I guess I'm a little late to find this place but thanks to my friend Brian who loves to try out new places as much as I do (next up, BreadFruit) we went to Hana today for lunch. I was impressed. After my less than stellar experience with Tottie's earlier this week I still had a major hankering for some raw fish...Hana to the rescue! I had no idea about the small space and the lunch rush but thankfully we got there right around noon and were able to walk right up to the sushi bar and sit down. After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef (didn't get his name) we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try. Within a minute, we were handed this interesting appetizer of a few tortilla chips with a yummy crab salad with a rice vinegar tasting base. It reminded me of squid salad - either way, it was on the house and was very tasty. Our first roll came out very quickly and was followed by a bowl of pickled wasabi to try with the sushi. I have eaten at MANY sushi restaurants, but have never been given this. Yum! Placed on top of the sushi it is very good, definitely try it. We went through each of the rolls - the Alaska was very good, the salmon nigiri was amazing, literally so fresh it melted in my mouth. The Vegas roll and the Dynamite roll were great as well. As we are finishing, the sushi chef starts talking to us about Giant Clam. Neither of us had seen a Giant clam before, so he pulled it out and starts showing us how it splashed you with salt water that comes out of its mouth. I thought it was very interesting, I'm not sure if the lady next to me did because she got salt water on her. My friend and I had to take a picture because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen but like something I have definitely seen, all at the same time. Its a little scary, I'm not going to lie. In fact, it looks slightly like something from a 70s porn movie. That's just what I've heard, not that I've ever seen a 70s porn, I mean, what kind of a girl do you think I am? Gosh! I took a picture on my phone so I will post it here for those of you who have never seen one. Overall, I had a good experience. As someone said earlier, the food tastes so much better when the sushi chef is smiling and enjoying himself. It was just fast enough for a lunch hour, just enough food, and just enough fun. However, it did get very busy after we arrived and there was a wait when we left. I would recommend getting there early to avoid the rush. Oh, and if you're adventurous, apparently that scary looking giant clam is delicious when sauteed :) I will let one of you try it first and let me know what you think. I'm not that brave yet.\n",
      "the food was okay, it's a bit pricey. I liked the big wood boat they served our sushi on. not my favorite but don't hate it either.\n",
      "Based on all the yelp reviews, my Mesa friend and I came here for dinner tonight. It was a fantastic choice. Our waiter was super nice and super quick. The atmosphere was dim and cozy. Definitely would not recommend this for a big group though, it would be a bit cramped. Here's what we ordered: 1.) Ika Kara Age (Sweet butter marinated squid breaded to a crunchy finish) - This dish was DELICIOUS, the squid was cooked just right! It wasn't chewy, rubbery or overcooked. It was tender, just enough flavor ...and many pieces in one order! 2.) Agadashi Tofu (Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito) - This dish was a little bland, you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor...the majority of the flavor would be in the sauce. But no. We had to sprinkle salt into the sauce ..which then made it better. 3.) Umi No Sachi (A sashimi salad) - A bed of mixed greens, HUGE chunks of sashimi all drizzled with a creamy white sauce. This was the highlight of our dinner. I've never seen a sashimi salad for $16 that had this much sashimi that was so fresh, cut into such big slices before. I absolutely give this dish 5stars!!!!!!! You HAVE TO try this. 4.) Alaskan Roll - A california roll wrapped with raw salmon. You think, what's so special right? There must have been a secret sauce they put inside this roll because you got this amazing after taste...that just made you want to take another piece and another piece....and another piece... 5.) Philadelphia Roll - A roll with cream cheese and salmon. This was average, nothing significant but i was happy. 6.) Spicy Tuna Roll - REALLY good spicy tuna roll, made me regret not ordering a spicy tuna hand roll....i bet that would have been orgasmic. All the more reason to revisit!! :)\n",
      "Amazing sushi! The food came out quick, and it was very fresh. Service was fantastic as well!\n",
      "After seeing all the amazing reviews thought of trying it out. Got 2 pieces of nigiri toro one salmon nigiri. Soft shel crab roll and avocado roll. My total was 87 dollars! Yes 87 dollars! I lived in LA for 10 years that is Nobu prices, this is Phx, lol really! This when you know a place thinks it's way better and bigger than it is they lose their way. I actually had to ask the prices to make sure because I was so dumbfounded. Anyways never going to this place and I recommended you don't either if you don't want to get ripped off. Lots of better sushi places for way less money in az!\n",
      "Hana is my personal favorite spot for Japanese and sushi in Phoenix. The sushi here is always fresh and high quality. Also, their sushi has properly done rice, which is hard to find in AZ. Everything else I've tried on the menu has been excellent, the soba and tempura stand out in particular. The service here is always really friendly. The only thing I wish Hana had was slightly more space inside. All around a great place for sushi and Japanese!\n",
      "Well, I have to say that I never would of thought of coming here on my own. But, My girlfriend had been here before and really liked it. So we give it a try then. It is located in a shopping center,right on the end. There is a decent amount of parking. The fun thing is you can bring your own booze in. Either beer or wine. You do not see that in many places, so I like it. The food is really fresh and quite good. I am not a huge fan of healthy food, but I will do it for T's sake. I do like it here though, not too bad at all. It is a bit small in here. So it can get crowded fast. It is clean ,and the staff is fun and nice.\n",
      "This is some of the best sushi I have ever had, obviously fresh and made to perfection. The taste was rivaled only by the presentation, the Caterpillar Rolls looked like a caterpillar, complete with sprout antenna and octopus sucker eyes. My Calamari looked like a little squid was so fresh and tender it nearly melted in my mouth. The menu has a lot to offer for non-sushi lovers, too. The service was great, four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Great service and great quality fish. My dad has been to Tokyo many times for work and says that this is the closest thing he has had to authentic sushi in the US.\n",
      "Each of my dining experiences at Hana have been great. The food is fresh and the staff is very friendly. The only complaint I would have is for some people that finish their food but take up a table after they have finished their meal. The restaurant is a bit on the small side so you have to wait a little longer if a group wants to take a couple of hours to finish up the bottle of wine they brought with them.\n",
      "this is the quintessential place to enjoy the finest, freshest sushi in the valley, though you will be paying for it. i live very close to hana and find myself going there at least once or twice a week. they have the usual assortment of sushi rolls, of course, but their specials on the board, are what you want to inquire about. i have had lobster rolls, not to be confused with what you would find in new england...and kobi beef, which melted in my mouth. the hamachi is delicious and their salads are a great value, fresh greens and slices of silky salmon, yellow tail, ahi and white fish. their baked clams are cooked to perfection. since i live right around the corner, i have only dined in on two occassions, and both times the wait staff was on top of things. and were able to answer questions about some of the more obscure offerings. it's a small place, but not claustrophic. there is a tv, but i never notice anyone watching it, they are so consumed with the food. i highly recommend hana.\n",
      "I liked it overall, but the performance was uneven. Very friendly service, but the food was all over the place with quality and taste. Some quite good, some solid, some just meh.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix and had struck out with other sushi places in town. We hate those modern loungey/clubby sushi restaurants but Hana was a nice small family owned restaurant that was centrally located. This place hands down won our vote for amazing service and very authentic and tasty sushi! We never had to wait longer than a few minutes for service even though they were packed. Wonderful and skilled sushi chefs got our food out quickly and the presentation and taste was 5 stars. We can't wait to come back!\n",
      "Sorry only 3 stars... I mean the sushi is not bad at all. Fancy creative rolls but for what I paid I don't think the food should cost that much ($60 for 2).. the tuna tar tar is tasteless and not fresh to me.. the rolls are so so.. good serive\n",
      "LOVE! Tiny spot. BYOB.....and awesome food! Does get quite crowded so be prepared for a wait at peak times. Very friendly staff. And very good service. We usually bring a bottle of wine and basically gorge ourselves on yummy rolls and nigiri. We get the boat....lol\n",
      "Yesterday I was seeking out a sushi bar in our quest to locate the best sushi in Phoenix, and this place looked promising. They had chefs who will make something interesting for you, and that is what I really like in a good sushi restaurant. When we walked in and looked at the menu, it looked decent. They had ankimo, so of course we got that. We also ordered some scallops, red snapper, spanish mackerel with deep-fried body, a baked salmon roll, some uni shooters, the carpaccio, and we also told them to just make us something interesting. We started out with miso soup. It was pretty typical. The carpaccio set the tone for the rest of the meal - on paper, stips of red snapper, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with a cucumber garnish and fresh wasabi should be awesome. But it was missing something. It was kind of bland. The carpaccio we had last week was one of the highlights; this time it was boring. If you have read any of my other recent sushi reviews, you'd know that one of my new favorite dishes is ankimo (or steamed monkfish liver). The ankimo they served us happens to be the first ankimo I didn't like. For some reason it tasted bland, and it was even a different color and texture than other ankimo I had. I suspect this was overcooked. They also brought us the ankimo sliders for good measure (hopefully they didn't charge us for this, because we didn't ask for it), and they were decent, but not mind-blowing. The waitress told us people usually bite the lemon it is served on in order to balance it out; my friend tried that and said it totally ruined it. Makes sense, as the slider has a lot of delicate flavors, and lemon is not delicate at all. The sushi (red snapper, scallop, Spanish mackerel) was pretty typical. I did like the deep fried Spanish mackerel body. The fish itself had very little meat, though. I've had Spanish mackerel with twice as much meat (see: Yama Sushi in Portland). The baked salmon roll was a terrible idea. I knew the idea of a cooked roll would not really appeal to me... But I was open to it. I like to let other people order things they want, too, you know... But neither of us cared for it. We think it actually had cheese on it. Yes, cheese, on a seafood dish. I would totally back legislation that made combining fish and yellow cheeses illegal. The uni shooters epitomized this place. It was an idea that sounded really, really awesome on paper, but was poorly executed. You see, the uni shooter contains an oyster, a piece of uni, and a raw quail egg. Sounds awesome, right? Of course it does. But it also had a sauce that was so strong that it completely masked the flavor of the things I actually wanted to taste. The oyster could still be noticed, but the quail egg was barely detectable, and the uni might as well have been left out. Uni is delicate, and should not be served with strong flavors. Without the sauce, it would've been perfect. I actually enjoyed the special item the chef made us. It was described to us (by who I believe may have been the owner) as a Japanese comfort food. Basically, it was a small stew/soup thing with eggs, uni, and a couple other things in it. It really was unique, and I haven't had anything else quite like it. Finally, the dessert menu contained one item I got really excited about: tempura ice cream. It has been about nine years since I had the dish in Kingston, NY, so, of course, I had to order it. Unfortunately, instead of one big scoop of ice cream, it was served in three small scoops, so all but a little ball of ice cream from each scoop was melted. It was basically tempura soaked in cream. Again, great idea, poor execution. This is a place I want to like, because the owner does have some creativity, and probably cares about the cuisine. It's definitely not generic, and that's definitely worth something. But compared to the meal we had last week, it paled in comparison. It was inferior in every single respect, and our bill was actually larger! In Phoenix, you can't charge $90/person after tip and expect repeat business, unless the entire experience is spectacular. Because there are places that provide that at that price point.\n",
      "Miso soup is awesome, dragon roll, lobster roll and Unagi all were really good too! Make sure to BYOB or your dinner will go really fast..LOL! Loved the service & friendly people! Even was told \"Happy Holidays\" as we left!\n",
      "Great sushi...highly recommended. The service was good to, only reason for 4 stars is the wait for the mussels.\n",
      "Good food good times. I've tried almost every sushi roll. The rainbow roll is one of my favorites. This visit I had the Alaskan and the Caterpiller and the oldy but goody California roll. Always with a cup of hot green tea. This place will allow you to bring your own alcoholic drinks but you can not sit in their patio area if you do.\n",
      "My co-workers and I came to eat here last Friday. One of them really wanted sushi and I've been wanting to try this place, so we thought we give it a try. We all got sushi, I got a little bit ahead of myself and got a Hana Bento Lunchbox. The sushi was great, we were the first ones there when it opened so we got our food fairly quickly. The place did get busy as lunch time rolled around. I didn't give this place 5 stars because when it was time to pay our checks they told us that we were each going to be charged an extra $1.50 for a split charge fee. That kind of pissed me off because how hard is it to really split a check? And why wouldn't you do it for free knowing that you're located by office buildings? I just don't understand the fee and because of this none of us are willing to go back now.\n",
      "Having Hana's quality sushi in my \"hood\" has been a real boon. The food is always good, the restaurant vibe energetic, and the waiters super fun. That's why I was sooooo disappointed to have a bad experience there. Hubby and I went out for dinner recently and were told by the host that the two open tables were now being reserved for walk-ins of parties of 4 only because, \"we make more money off them.\" That's exactly what he said. He told us that something at the sushi bar was sure to open up soon. Thirty minutes later and still waiting, we now had a growing crowd of two's on the wait list. A party of three walked in and were seated IMMEDIATELY. We should have walked out right then, but we were so hungry we figured it couldn't be much longer. Wrong. We waited another 20 minutes until a table finally opened up. Meanwhile, the table for four remained empty. This is a BAD policy. Seating should be first-come, first-served. I will only be doing takeout there from now on. The food is 4 star. The wait policy is 1 star.\n",
      "I had better, maybe went on a bad night. Maybe I should have asked for recommendations. But my food was blah. Nothing out of this world. Disappointing, but after reading the reviews, maybe I should go back and try it again.\n",
      "Our 1st taste of Sushi in Phoenix and we were impressed. It was a lot busier and louder than our local sushi place in Chicago, but the food didn't disappoint. It was a bit pricier than we are used to, but the fish was super fresh and came out quick. The ordering process seemed a bit confusing but our waitress help us through it with a smile! I will definitely give it another try once we move there.\n",
      "I went here while it was raining and it just has that great warmth atmosphere to it. I went in on a crowded day so I signed in and walked around the area for fun. When I got back and got seated I ordered Takoyaki and Volcano roll, they were delicious and is now my two favorite foods that I would order from here. 5/5 for the great quality of food they served.\n",
      "Did i go to the wrong place? all the great reviews & then....meh!!!! The quality was decent, definitely not the best ive ever had...good, but for the price there are better spots in the valley. i appreciate that its a small female owned business & we may stop back by - but i definitely wasnt feeling the love like so many others.\n",
      "Always excellent. My faves are the salmon nigiri and the eel nigiri. But you can't go wrong here.\n",
      "Maybe this place is ok if your idea of good sushi is a Las Vegas roll and the closest you've been to Japan is Peoria, but if you've been to California, Hawaii, or Japan, this will not meet even your lowest expectations. I've lived in Japan for several months while studying there and have been back numerous times, so I can have high standards for Japanese food. I understand standards are lower here in Phoenix, but still I've had far better at other non-Japanese restaurants here in the Valley. We first arrived and we're greeted by a nice waitress. She took our drink orders and told us about the specials. \"Car-agee chicken\" \"What?!\" I'm not a Japanese language snob, but if you work in a Japanese restaurant that claims to sell Japanese food, at least learn the proper pronunciation of the dishes. It's \"kah-rha-ah-geh chicken\" Next came the food. My dad order the Tai special at the suggestion of the waitress. Should've known better judging by her knowledge of Japanese food. It was 4 small pieces of over-cooked fish for $23. What a rip! My food was mediocre at best. The sushi rice was plain-- no rice wine vinegar as is customary for properly flavored sushi rice. Tempura was ok but the sauce did not come with shredded daikon. For shame, Hana! You're giving Japanese food a bad name!\n",
      "Very enjoyable Sushi at this small quaint neighborhood restaurant. The toro belly was especially delicious. The tempura was also light and tasty. A few special rolls we tried were on point. Our server did a okay job. The missing star is lack of being seated fur 10-15 minutes even tho have the tables were open. We finally gave up and sat at the sushi bar rather than continuing to wait. The chefs did not communicate or check in with us. The good food was worth the inconvenience.\n",
      "I haven't been to Hana's since it first opened. So its been quite a few years. As I made my return I slowly remembered why I haven't been to Hana's in... well, quite a few years. I'm happy for them in one aspect because it looks like they have come a long way as far as the amount of diners are concerned. The pricing on the other hand is just ridiculous. Way overpriced for a small neighborhood operation. (And then again maybe that's why it is that way) That is just my opinion. Or at least compared to the major players I frequent. These are a couple of my favs. RA, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Broker's...even Kona Grill is gettin' some love. Okay, so right off the bat I notice I have an appetizer of some sort made with Surimi (fish paste aka fake crab or krab) on some sort of fried dumpling chip (like a crab rangoon). I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is when some sushi restaurants make that the basis of many of their dishes. (i.e. the old Mr. Sushi located at Northern and I-17) So, basically their Surimi concoction is inside of every roll or in, on or alongside any other dish you may order. Okay, so back to the pricing. Now my thought is if you're going to have these \"unusual\" prices, please don't wave the former lower prices in my face by simply crossing them out on the menu in magic marker where I can still see them and replace them with higher prices. Just get a new menu. I'm cool with that. That's like going to the store to see a cool shirt you want to buy and you realize that it's 20 dollars but the tag underneath says it was 10 dollars...now that's a bummer. So, I end up ordering a Rainbow Roll (One of my staple sushi meals. You can't mess that up right?) that is close to 16 dollars. (Of course I have to look at the previous price of 10 dollars that is crossed out...bummer) I also order a Scallop Dynamite (which is one of my favorites at RA, so let's give it a try here.) That was up there in price too. I think it was close to 14 or 15 dollars as well. Anyway, both were disappointing. The Rainbow Roll had no shrimp on it and was filled with my favorite yummy Surimi concoction. (That's me being facetious) The Scallop Dynamite came out in some aluminum foil that was hand shaped to form a shallow dish. (I'm assuming it was prepared in this) Not only was that presentation ghetto fabulous it was primarily made of...you guessed it! Yummy Surimi Concoction! (That's me being facetious again) So, with these two items and a canned green tea my total was $36 and some odd cents not including the tip. So, after I was helped off of the barrel and untied, I calmly pulled my pants back up, removed the ball gag from my mouth and walked out to my vehicle and left. The entire drive I was seething to get back and write this very review. Although I must add that the staff was friendly and attentive. If I could give a 2.5 I would. I just can't bring myself to do a 3 in this situation. Good luck Hana Japanese Eatery!\n",
      "This place was really awesome! The service was phenomenal & they accommodated my boyfriend's shellfish allergy better than any restaurant we've ever gone to! They really went above and beyond. So I'm Japanese from Hawaii & really miss Japanese food when I'm in Arizona. I have found a few places that have been okay, but so far Hana is the best Japanese I've had in Phoenix! A little on the pricey side, this has the best actual Japanese food (not just sushi). Previously I said Hiro Sushi, but for Japanese food other than sushi - Hana has taken the crown. We tried the shrimp & veg tempura, chicken tatsuuaage (karaage), a philly roll (no shellfish :P), ahi, gyu tan bowl (sukiyaki), mochi, and probably some more that I forgot. Everything was good and here's where I was really impressed - normally because places fry everything in the same fryer, if you have a shellfish allergy you can't eat ANYTHING fried. However, Hana was so accommodating and made it possible for my boyfriend to finally try tempura (their's is very light!). They really accommodated us --- thank you for great service! A few things were a little overcooked/I wouldn't order again, but their tempura & sukiyaki were both 10/10!!! Can't wait to return here & I definitely will be soon!\n",
      "Good sushi. Nothing exotic, just pretty good fish, which is difficult enough to find in Phoenix. -The uni was a little sweet, but at this point in the year, it should be sweet and melting - The maguro was better than average. It had a little bit of a bite, which is what I look for - The aji was very nice - The hamachi was buttery and the best fish of the night - The unagi was better than average - The albacore was average - The suzuki was delicious - The halibut was light and a nice way to start - The Hana roll was ok. Nothing exciting - The gyoza were not good - Service was friendly, but a little slow If I'm in the area and jonesing for sushi, I'll go.\n",
      "I come here semi-regularly, The sushi is reasonably priced for the great quality of the dishes. Restaurant is small so you may find yourself waiting for a table bit it's worth the wait. Over all I'd say it's one of the grearest sushi experiences you'll have in Phoenix. Also it's BYOB so if you plan on drinking alcohol with your meal make sure you stop at the Bashas up the street.\n",
      "Went last night and it was ridiculously bad. The waitress took our order but after about 25 minutes, the sushi hadn't come. Then she comes back and says there's a \"mixup\" at the sushi station and she RETAKES our sushi order, saying its \"getting plated\". It took another 20 minutes for the rolls to come out and they came out one by one. They were tasteless, probably because she had the chefs make them in a rush due to having forgotten our order entirely. No apology, no regard, nothing. I'm never going back there again.\n",
      "I wish I could give them 10 STARS This review is overdue - my wife introduced me to Sushi a year ago while on vacation in San Francisco and it was good. But Hana has some of the best tasting dishes ANYWHERE; the Hamachi sashimi, tuna misoyaki, tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, dynamite shrimp and crab... I could go on and on - and the BYOB only adds to the experience. Be ready to wait, but its worth it.\n",
      "Love this place! Our Server, Robert made sure we got in and had a nice table for 5 - even though it was super crowded (not a surprise) we didn't have to wait that long. For future reference, it's better to eat a little later to cut that wait time. Food was amazing and can't wait to come back again soon! Great fresh sushi - and tempura that was done very well - not greasy at all! Good job Hana!\n",
      "Had a large group goto Hana for the first time (on a Sunday night without a reservation) and we all enjoyed it! The waitstaff were quite nice and very accommodating, and the rolls were quite good and reasonably priced. The restaurant is BYOB which I rather like. The rolls were very good and the fish tasted very fresh. The tuna rolls are $8, California rolls around $7 and various specialty rolls for $11-$12. They will also make the rolls to your own spiciness liking. On the fun side, the rolls are served on a wooden boat with a flaming sugar cube! The place is small and i can see how it could be quite noisy in there if it is busy. They charge $1.50 fee per credit card if you want to pay with more then 1 card. Overall I enjoyed Hana and will most likely be returning!\n",
      "Service - STELLAR! Everyone was super friendly and fast. Food - Very good but comes at a cost. 1. BYOB with no corkage - How very cool! 2. Red Snapper Special - $25 for baked snapper with a refreshing soy sauce vinaigrette. Fresh and light although it reminded me of getting a whole steamed fish at the Chinese restaurants. 3. Agedashi Tofu - Subpar. Cut too small to enjoy the smooth soft tofu. Broth was flavorless. 4. Salmon Sushi - Amazing. 5. Salmon Skin Roll - That thing was stuffed to the brim. 6. Cucumber and Fish Special - A cucumber stuffed with a variety of raw fish. Very very good.\n",
      "It was an ok / meh kind of place. If you work nearby it might be worth a try, but don't bother making a long drive. I came in for the lunch special to see what all the hype was about. Overall the sushi seemed dry. There are many sushi places in the valley, and many that offer better sushi at a cheaper price.\n",
      "Best sushi I have had in Phoenix. Everything we have had has been fresh. I 100% recommend trying at least 1 item off the handwritten posted menu every time! We have had some great dishes compiled of things we may not have had the opportunity to try other wise. Hana is BYOB but does offer sodas, water, juices and a variety of teas if you forget your adult beverage. Service is quick and no nonsense.\n",
      "We have previously been a big fan of Hana for quite awhile. It is close to our home in the Biltmore Area and we have always enjoyed the food - which is fresh, innovative, and unique... However, we have had the same issue regarding customer service (seating policy) numerous times during our visits - and in our last visit on Thursday, it actually compelled us to finally walk out..... Almost of all our visits were just made up of my wife and I (party of two) and I think the strict seating policy of not ever giving a table of four to a party of two is ridiculous. Now, I completely understand the desire to reserve larger tables for larger parties - I actually worked in several restaurants in my pre-professional phase of life in high school and college - but to blindly apply it across all circumstances like - in our case - when there is no one else waiting in the later part of the evening on a Thursday night is short-sighted and just plain dumb. Here was our scenario: - We arrive around 7:30pm - one table available with four empty seats, and we are informed \"I'm sorry, we have to keep that open for larger parties..\" Larger, really? A party of four does not exactly make a massive celebration... - We agree to wait to see if something else opens up. - While toting a very nice bottle of chilled white wine from home, we continue to wait. No one comes by with an offer of glasses, a wine chiller, nothing..... 20 minutes goes by... If you are going to stick with a goofy policy like this - at least make the effort to keep people happy. How hard would it be to bring glasses, and ice bucket, and maybe even take an order for an appetizer?? Again, nothing .... - It's now almost 1/2 hour of waiting - close to 8pm - no one has left the restaurant nor has anyone come in either.. The empty table of four remains empty not earning the restaurant a dime in revenues or (most shockingly) the goodwill of a customer who really does want to patronize you... - Finally, a party of three shows up - that's three, not four... Of course, they are seated immediately while we continue to wait. - At that point, I tell the person seating guests that we're leaving and we walk out... At this point, I'm done. The service received was not only inept - but basically rude as well. My recommendation: don't even consider this place if you are a couple looking for a nice dinner out. I will not be back unless someone takes an active interest in fixing this issue going forward. Plenty of other choices in the Camelback Corridor where one does not have to put up with that BS...\n",
      "Best sushi I've had in a while. BYOB is awesome, but be aware, no vodka, haha, oops. Just beer, saki, and wine. Seriously though, such GOOD SUSHI.\n",
      "This was a great place to enjoy dinner for my daughters' birthdays! The miso soup was perfect, the sushi rolls were very good, and the service was great. They even brought a delicious fried ice cream dish with strawberries and whipped cream to help us celebrate. The only thing I was disappointed in was the iced teas were not fresh, but canned, although the foreign can was fun, too. We will be back!\n",
      "This is a nice intimate sushi place. Their sushi tastes quite fresh and I never really leave unhappy. If you can spare the time for lunch here then it is well worth a visit. I used to come here with my coworkers and we typically got enough sushi to have it served on one of the boats. This is a nice touch and definitely makes the experience a little more interesting. My girlfriend and I had dinner here a few nights ago and the restaurant's service was very good. They were speedy and attentive. I am positive that I will be returning.\n",
      "Wow. We drove 35 miles to try this place recommended by a friend who is a local well known chef, it was worth every mile and every minute. The cuisine was soooo delicious. We stayed away from traditional sushi items only because we wanted to see what else the kitchen had up their sleeves. So glad we did! Everything the server recommended was fabulous. We brought our own wine, a regular practice here as they were ready with glasses from the moment we walked in the door. Be prepared to wait a bit, it's popular but worth it!\n",
      "Quite sure this is THE best sushi in the Valley. Small location, quaint, and not a lot of frills, BUT the service is great, and did I mention they have the best sushi? Seriously, I dream about the yellowtail sashimi. Yum.\n",
      "This place is such a great find. My husband and I love doing date night here. The sushi is really yummy and authentic. Their spicy tuna is the best I've ever had. Give me that, the shrimp tempura roll, and I'm set! My husband always likes starting off with the edamame, but here's a head's up - If you like your edamame warm, ask them to heat it. Otherwise they will serve it cold, which is apparently the traditional (unAmericanized) way to eat it. Hana is byob and they don't charge an uncorking fee. This is truly unbelievable to me and I hope they don't change that policy any time soon. This makes date night SUPER affordable in addition to being yummy! The only downside is dependent on the crowd. If it's busy and you happen to go when there are larger parties, it can get really loud. If there aren't lot of larger parties, it's no louder than any other restaurant. Otherwise, the decor and simple, the ambiance is relaxed, and it's got a great vibe.\n",
      "Overall good local place for sushi and reasonable prices. BYOB is a great bonus and will get us to return for sure. Service was very good for us and the wait was reasonable considering how small the restaurant is. About the only negative is that restaurant seems very small and cramped and it was fairly loud throughout our meal.\n",
      "3 out of 5 based on Sushi alone. Sushi wasn't prepared very well, it fell apart easily and the taste was just ok. Willing to go back to try again as the staff was nice and there seemed to be a lot of regulars. BYOB.\n",
      "Hana's has become one of my top go to places in Phoenix. I love their sashimi, sushi rolls, curry udon and yes the fact that you can bring in your own wine. Their specials are just too good to pass. Yummy awesome food, Will come back soon !!\n",
      "There are so many things *right* with Hana that one can almost overlook the sordid quality and schmaltzy presentation of their sushi rolls. Overriding every other concept of the restaurant is the fact that 95% of the hungry patrons at Hana are boozehounds like myself, and this place will cater to the unholy amounts of BYOB that each table will bring. What is truly exceptional is that 1) No corkage fee 2) They will chill your white for you in an ice bucket at the table 3) If you bring beer, they will keep it in their fridge for you and bring you another as you continue to dine 4) everyone here relishes in this policy. Seriously, I witnessed a table of 5 with 5 bottles of wine and a sixer of some imported swill. You could eat a seaweed wrapped piece of Gypsy at this saturation point, and it would taste like toro. So, my gf Melissa B and I get there around 6:30 on a Saturday loaded up with our Sav Blanc and six of Rogue Dead Guy Ale and with full intentions of waiting for a table due to the popularity of this restaurant and its 50 person max capacity. Surprisingly, they had 3 tables open, all of them 4-tops. The hostess informs us that the wait will be 20-25 mins and I'm thinking 'oh, cool, those tables must be reserved. No worries. Oh, and hey look! There is a two top paying out'. Well, after that couple leaves, they scoot over the two top to make it a six top and seat the aforementioned boozer-quintuplets who were rightfully there before us still waiting. Okay. No biggie, there are still open tables. A party of three come in. \"Hi! There is no waiting\". They get a seat Another party of three stroll in. Yep. \"Hi! There is no waiting\". There goes our last chance of a seat for a while, and we're 25 mins into our wait. Thank God I brought the beer. As I understand it, they will only seat parties of two at their two tops [of which they had few, and one was being used as an impromptu wine rack for the wino-Salingers] or at the sushi bar. I really have absolutely no problem with this policy, but I could see how it would piss some people off -- maybe from an older generation who feel slighted by shit like this, which is why I'm even discussing it. But anyway, we eventually we got our perfect little two top and preceded to order edamame and miso. These are two staple appetizers for any Japanese restaurant. The edamame came out cold, which was okay, as it is typically served cooled .. but I actually prefer my edamame heated and the server never asked for a preference ... hell, they even ask you at throw-away joints like Ra. Since we are a culture of benevolent Americans who are intent on skewing EVERY foreign dish, I always assume that the edamame will be served warm. Either way, I was too timid to ask since these servers seem to be flying around the small restaurant with nary a second to spare at the microwave. The miso soup was excellent ... but if I'm looking for shit to complain about, they served it with that damn goofy, oversized spoon. When we got our boat of fish my gf and I commented that we would have liked a little extra prep time. I mean come on, there needs to be distinct transitional times between courses. We were only mildly impressed with the presentation. The rolls were prepped very sloppily. The yellowtail was absolutely lost in the rice. The tempura shrimp was sliced so thin that it was destroyed by the chopstick. The caterpillar roll had almost no essence of eel within. The spicy tuna was good, but nothing to rave about as seems to be the trend when discussing Hana. We also ordered the processed daikon off of their specials-board [which our server never went over BTW], and I would highly recommend staying away from this unless you curiously want to know what Little Lisa's Slurry from the Simpson's episode \"The Old Man and The Lisa\" might have tasted like. Blech. I'm sure it was downhome authentic, but Christ, THAT was vile. Anyway, that was MY fault, not Hana's. I will say that the first time that I came to Hana [with Graham C and Yelp's famous Jerry], it was absolutely phenomenal. I think something has been lost in translation. Back then, their rolls were much better prepared and the toro was otherworldly. Perhaps it is the hulking Melrose virulence seeping into their foundation. I will conclude with a statement about how I am aware that Hana is going for authenticity; which makes the curt service, lack of formalities like \"hi! how is everyone today\" [I doubt they do that shit at sushi joints in Japan], and loud, bustling atmosphere work to a degree. I can HOWEVER, see that being such a turn-off to those unwilling or unaware to put up with it, or worse yet, interpret it as rudeness. I personally like the fact that places like Hana exist as an antithesis to garbage like Ra. But every polarization needs an equilibrium, and for my money, time, and need for experience, nothing beats Sakana.\n",
      "This place is very close to my house, so, I eat here regularly. It's always fresh good cuts of sushi/sashimi. My personal favs are: salmon, yellowtail, mackeral, tamago, and freshwater eel. I also love the rainbow carpaccio and Hana salad (tons of avocado, parmesan, and sunflower seeds-YUM). I only wish they would add inari to the menu. Remember to bring your own alcohol because they don't have it. Otherwise you'll be stuck with green tea instead of sake like me (I always forget). Also, be prepared to wait as this place is quite small and always packed at dinner time.\n",
      "Terrible wait time and service, thank you for ruining valentines day for us. Food is ok but the service sucks even with reservation. Go else where if you want a quality time. Never going back.\n",
      "Best sushi in town!!! Love coming here any time we can. Came here with the wife today and amazed as usual... We had the volcano roll (white fish), spicy tuna, Hana roll and my favorite off the menu item, chirachi bowl which has white fish, tuna, salmon, octopus, scallops and more over white rice. It is not cheap but worth every penny!! Love this place!!!\n",
      "Delicious!! Raw rolls fresh & seasoning well balanced, yet explosive in flavor. Good prices. Friendly & patient server. Docked a star since my friend waited 30 minutes (no joke) for her spider roll (something that shouldn't have taken that long to prep). My other friend & I got ours in a timely fashion, especially given how busy they were. Kind of a cozy/low-key place-limited seating. I would happily return there again!\n",
      "I honestly love this restaurant so so much. Their food is always so good. Definitely my favorite sushi place in the valley. I love their poki chips and their seaweed salad as well. My only complaint is the price...they are definitely overpriced and can be stingy with servings. But because i love their food so much, i go here anyway.\n",
      "I took my lady here since she's never been here before. She has a thing for sashimi so I figured this place was pretty good...well reviewed and semi-upscale. The place is small...we had to wait standing in line for about an hour and a half. I wish it was shorter or we could've made a reservation but with the way women get ready...I didn't know if I was going to arrive within 10 minutes of my reservation or 10 days (let's be honest here). I then asked and I think I recollect that they don't take reservations. The parking is somewhat tight when it's night time. Apparently, this is where they get the most business. However, I guess you can always park in the neighborhood streets just a few feet away. It's BYOB. You can bring your own alcohol. I wish I would've brought Moscato but we didn't know until I asked. Our waitress service was slow, but we sat up front and the Sushi Master was a old Japanese guy...quite nice guy. He attended to us very well. Their prices are a little higher than what I'm accustomed to from eating at places like Saki Bomber's or Kabuki but I like watching the food being made in front of me. I would say the food is very fresh but let's face it...the coast is in California and we all know about the drive from there. However, the food was still very delicious. We also bought some of the soup noodle to go. That was very delicious still when we got hungry later on. They had this very cool menu item I think where they bring you a wooden boat with fire and sushi on it. I came back a few days later with a friend and ordered it. Very good. Overall, I thought this place was a very nice date night place. The wait sucks but it's worth it. We came out full and with a few takeout boxes.\n",
      "One of THE BEST Japanese restaurants in town! (My other choice is the Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale) I've been here several times and always had the most delicious foods! I usually order sushi and several items from the 'special' menu on the wall. The fish is so tasty, raw or cooked! Also, the rice is really good here. (I know, it's silly but it's really key to a good Japanese meal to me :)) The menu consists of variety of Japanese comfort foods too so you can try different types of Japanese food other than Sushi and Sashimi. I love the BYOB so you can bring your own alcoholic drink, if you so desire. They'll keep the bottles chilled and serve it to you when you want to refresh your drink. I believe they'd also warm up your sake if you like it hot. The inside is quite small so if you don't want to wait - for dinner - (there's not much of a waiting area either) I suggest to get there right when they open :) If you like Japanese food, this is the place to go :) Arigatou!\n",
      "Very good, I'm in town with a friend for business and we wanted sushi. Our hostess suggested Hana and after reading the reviews we are very happy we came here. Yes get the pickled Wasabi recommended on other reviews and we've really liked everything we tried. The Hana pride was my first time with a cucumber roll and we had the dynamite, the volcano all were good.\n",
      "I cannot put into words my undying love for Hana's. The sushi is always top notch and ever since my husband and first dined at that sushi bar, we haven't been to any other japanese restaurant. Why would we?? We get ridiculously excited when we find someone who hasn't heard of Hana's (getting tougher since it's fame isn't so hidden) and we quickly take them out! BYOB is awesome! I'd say it helps us save a little bit of cash, but that extra cash just ends up being spent on more SUSHI! That or the great staff! Anywhere else I my \"complain\" about the minimum seating, but here it makes you feel like you are in a dear friends dining room. During our 1 year anniversary dinner we splurged big time and now I am ADDICTED to the Hana Pride roll. It's everything good in this world all on one plate. YUM! Thank you, Hanas, for always welcoming us into your kitchen and letting us peek over the counters as you masterfully create meals that warm our hearts! -The Larsons\n",
      "Hana has without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. I was blown away at how good it was. The Salmon Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Every roll we ordered was just mouth watering goodness. Only complaint is that the Edamame is served cold, I've never been a fan of that. Not even a big deal.\n",
      "Food was on pricey side for their dinners especially for a place that small and no liquor license. I eat at many Asian restaurants and never pay that much anywhere. Too noisy. I was there yesterday with a group and we could not hold a conversation due to the noise. Even trying to hear the person next to you at times was difficult. Not well organized. Waiter just plunked all our checks in middle of table and we had to figure out who they belonged to. Checks were handwritten and confusing. Made a $2 error in their favor on my check which I called to their attention. I also did notice that when they include the gratuity they are basing it on the total which includes the tax. This is not right. It is not the amount it is the principle.e noise. I opted for an appetizer of sliced pork in order to avoid the fried as well as the high carb foods. This was just average in taste. They do not take reservations but this could be due to the size and number of tables. Would not recommend for groups over 4.\n",
      "Saw an episode of Check Please Arizona with Hana spotlighted. My wife and I have been looking for a good sushi/sashimi restaurant so we thought we'd give it a shot. We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the store. But, although it was small, the food was excellent and the service was over then top. It's a great neighborhood/family spot with BYOB. We were wondering about the prices until the order arrived and saw we absolutely got our money's worth. Definitely our new goto place for sashimi.\n",
      "I love Sushi and Hana Japanese Eatery is simply one of the best places I have had the pleasure of eating sushi at. This is coming from someone who lived in Japan for four years and tried really hard to get mercury poisoning while there. Hana's reminds me of all the great sushi places on the shore in Japan. It is not fancy and does not need to be because they put their money into the food and you can taste it. Their chefs are absolutely amazing and create not only amazing sushi but also great dishes. The service is just as good as the food. I have eaten at Hanas about 20 times and I have never had a bad waiter. EVER!\n",
      "Visited @HanaSushi for the first time, today. Ordered a spicy tuna roll, a Yellowtail roll, a Vegas roll, and the Volcano roll. The spicy tuna was delicious, and had a great presentation. The Yellowtail roll was good, but underwhelming. The Vegas roll was amazing! The crispy edge made for a unique experience in sushi. The Volcano roll was out of this world fantastic! The top layer of white fish, with the spicy sauce, and the added characteristic of it being baked, made for what is my new favorite dish. I will definitely be returning.\n",
      "Hana holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first Japanese place I've eaten here in Arizona! I've been here multiple times for their sushi and yes, yes, yes hands down really good quality sushi/sashimi and they do BYOB- uhm what? Yes, come here. I decided to do something different for a change and try their ramen- I've been in all sorts of Asian food withdrawals so yeah, ramen it was. I ordered the Tonkotsu broth ramen and an order of Salmon Nigiri, because the quality of their fish here is on point. The waitress was nice enough to confirm and even offer me an egg of which I quickly agreed, until I questioned what kind - a chicken egg, she replies ... uhm not exactly what I was asking. She later responds, oh soft boiled! She was so cute! Hahaha. Soft boiled eggs are my weakness, FYI. The tonkotsu broth was milky, good chewy noodles and fairly large in portion, the charshu was thick but oh-so tender and the soft boiled egg was perfect. It comes with menma, scallions, wakame and naruto garnish the top which are good flavor accents to the bowl of ramen. The service here is good, love the dim and intimate atmosphere. Rick is always smiling and observant of his customers! I always feel welcomed and appreciated when coming here. The total bill for the ramen and two pieces of nigiri came out to be around $18-20 with tip, which is a bit pricey for just ramen. However, it's pretty good in comparison than other ramen I've had here in Phoenix and the quality of the food and service here is downright great.\n",
      "Lunch time was busy at this place. It was our 1st time eating at this restaurant. The staffs were friendly and the food was good. I had ramen noodle soup with soft boiled egg, it was good but not great. I'll try different next time maybe some sushi rolls. My hubby had tuna bento box, it was good.\n",
      "Hana has got to be the place with the friendliest service around!! Everyone who works here from the servers to the cooks to the owner are super friendly and helpful, you can tell they truly enjoy what they do! Food is delicious, and I love that it's BYOB. They are also very accommodating with food allergies, it's one of the first things I was asked when I sat down. You're guaranteed to have fun when you eat here!\n",
      "Hana's is great! Everything is always fresh and delicious. It is a small establishment with friendly service. You can BYOB which is fun. I have had everything from sushi, sashimi, rolls, tempura or one of their dinner entrees and everything is absolutely delicious. I like the super casual vibe. I am just not into the foofoo sushi bars. I eat there often so shame on me for not reviewing them sooner!\n",
      "Took my dad here when he was in town. He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him! We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by. Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat. They were correct. It was almost hard to find a spot to park. The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed. They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5. The hostess was very nice and polite. The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian. (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of \"Americanization of the food\"). The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it. All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes. There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children. We ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc. The edamame came out cold - never had cold before. When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy. All the food was good, not exceptional. The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had. We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less. Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out... Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again. If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a try.\n",
      "I think Hana is one of the best casual sushi experiences in Phoenix. I went there with friends almost once a week for the last year, until I moved. They are small and cosy, but very friendly and helpful. Admittedly, the first time I went I was a tad bit underwhelmed with the service, as the girl was efficient but very reserved. Feels strange after the chattiness of most wait staff! But the fish was excellent so we went back, and really, they are all lovely, just not as effusive as usual. Best feature of all is the BYO - bring beer or wine and they will provide the cups and keep your bottles in the fridge. No charge! The Rainbow Carpaccio is sublime, the sashimi is always fresh, and most importantly, they have fresh wasabi. Now fresh wasabi is a new experience for me, but it is so far beyond the standard wasabi paste, it will knock your socks off. I am now seriously disappointed when I go to an upscale sushi restaurant and they do not have it. I've moved now, and have not managed to find anything as good. Lucky lucky downtown Phoenicians, take advantage of this great local sushi joint.\n",
      "BYOB and great food. sweet combo even if the wait is sometimes/often 40 plus min. the noodle dishes while okay, the sushi never disappoints and the Agadashi Tofu, Gyoza, Ika Kara Age and Hana salad are reliable favorites. Hana An Mitsu dessert- Aloe vera accompanied by mandarin oranges, blueberries & red bean paste w/a cherry on top, rocks my world! outstanding! a healthy and guilt-free pleasure. just go.\n",
      "Ok, so this is a little hard for me since I have only eaten here once. I have been to Hana three times, but twice they weren't serving sushi that day...odd. I thank them for not giving me bad product, but no sushi? I wanted sushi. The one time I did get sushi it was pretty amazing. It was fresh and delish! I would recommend Hana to others, but it still doesn't top the amazing Tokyo Lobby (my personal fave!)\n",
      "Oh hell no. I don't understand the hype. I was totaly grossed out. I love sushi but did not like this place at all. It was overpriced, the menu was limited and the fish was a little too fishy for my tastes. It was like a lot of the sushi places I visited in Japan - but it was NOT like the good ones. I know Hana is one of the most authentic sushi restaurants in Phoenix, but that doesn't mean EVERYTHING has to be covered in mayonaise, does it? I hate mayo. The Hana roll was supposed to be a \"house specialty\" but it was just about as special as the Shrimp roll at Safeway. The Hamachi Kama was a highlight, but might have been a bit over cooked. The tuna sashimi was chewy and rough. Ew! Sashimi should melt in your mouth, not take longer to take down than roadside beef jerky. Also - green tea in a can? I can get that at Lee Lee's market. Fresh brew it or gring it up in a bowl or something. No cans please. I DID dig all the punk rock lesbian servers. The contrast of small Asian men to big lezbot women was priceless.\n",
      "Bizarre. My family of 5 came here for lunch one day, to see what all the hype is about - and boy did Hana fall FLAT! I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them. Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd. And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was \"so do you want it?\" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks. The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the \"crab\" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. Would I come back? Uhm.... only if I had no choice and was craving ramen. But for sushi? Save your money, go to Yen and get muuuuch better quality AND quantity.\n",
      "I know this is a Japanese restaurant, but get the steak here! It is amazing!!! Hands down my go to place for my steak fix :9 Their sushi rolls are also very well made and the staff is very friendly :)\n",
      "Why does this place have a good reputation? In my three visits over multiple years I've never been impressed at all. The fish is not especially fresh or attractive, the rice is hard and not all that tasty, the service is chaotic. I want to like this place. I really do. But it's not nearly as good as Harumi or Yasu or Hiro. The bright points were the green tea (best I've had in a long time) and the spicy tuna roll, which was very good. But the salmon skin hand roll was a disaster. Nothing about it was good. Instead of crispy salmon skin you get what I'll call salmon scrapings, meaty, but not in a good way. And there are these strong-tasting vegetables in there that are totally out of place and quite sad. The nigiri was kind of okay. Nothing at all special about the proteins, and the rice balls are dense and hard without that tangy vinegar flavor I expect. I've had bad tamago maybe once before in my life, and this tamago was maybe the worst. Ice cold, falling apart, and just not the right flavor. The eel was rather disappointing too, and I rarely feel that way about eel anywhere. The best protein was probably the scallop, but that isn't saying much. Salmon was disappointing too. Especially after the sensational salmon we've enjoyed at Hiro the last couple of visits. Our server was enthusiastic and pleasant, but everything came at the wrong time. Our so-so tempura appetizer came out about 10 minutes after the sushi, and the soups we ordered never came at all. At least they didn't try to charge us for them. I won't be back. There's much better sushi to be had nearby.\n",
      "This is the best sushi in Phoenix. Ask for the chopped tuna when ordering the spicy tuna roll for an extra fresh treat. They are pricey, but definitely worth it. The restaurant is small, so considering ordering to go. They always throw in poke chips for the takeout orders, and they sometimes surprise you with fresh wasabi. Seriously the best sushi in the valley. Maybe the state.\n",
      "Have to knock down a star... Went back tonight and 2 of the 3 rolls were not nearly as amazing as last time...sticky, gooey rice and mushy tuna in a ball is not what I ordered. Still loved the ambiance and service (although we did feel slightly rushed) but hopefully the sushi can improve for next time...\n",
      "So about 5 months ago I had a normal life, you know a dope little condo, a nice girlfriend, even a little pup, but what my life was really lacking, was a dopalicious sushi joint in my life and as if my eyelash wishes came true Hana appears, I can easily say its the second best sushi joint in Phoenix (right behind Yasu) and honestly if Hana could figure out a way to make there sushi rice a little more enjoyable I would easily pass the crown. There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public). So if you want to have ultra fresh sushi without all the garbage glam that most sushi places throw in your face, while drinking some steel reserve with a date who you are trying to convince that you once lived a normal life, than this place is perfect for you yo.\n",
      "Authentic Japanese food, a bit pricey, but it's worthy.\n",
      "Best sushi in Phoenix, hands down. Awesome friendly staff as well. Great service, great sushi, relaxed environment. This is my new favorite spot.\n",
      "Hurry up and Leave! This was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!! Fist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED! We were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing. I'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed! We ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!\n",
      "Tonight the Jolly Diners went back to the Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th Ave in Phoenix. The Hana Japanese Eatery not only has very wonderfully prepared and presented dishes, they also have impeccable service; which again made our dining experience fantastic. I had Yasi Yaki Udon. My mom had Tori Kara Age, and I had another noodle dish that I'm afraid I can't pronounce. For appetizers we had cubed tofu, and Tempura vegetables. The Jolly Diners rated the Hana Japanese Eatery at a 5 out of 5. It was busy, and Beyer than the first time. They have plenty of sushi, dishes without animal products, and others with chicken and pork. We recommend this restaurant for people who appreciate well prepared, good food.\n",
      "The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality. Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill.\n",
      "First off... this place should have $$$ instead of just two. If you're going to eat just sushi, you'll love this place. They have amazing rolls and sashimi (I don't like fish and I still enjoyed the Spicy Tuna)! I also ordered the Ramen and it had an unpleasant barnyard flavor that I'm not sure was supposed to be there, but was unwelcome. I was glad that everybody else was almost done eating when it came out because I would hate to be the one who ruined everybody else's otherwise pleasant dining experience. If you're looking for a romantic night out, this is not the place to go. It's so loud, you'll be yelling at each other and repeating yourself all night.\n",
      "I love Hana! I really wish I had gone there tonight instead of Moto, which is horrible. But anyway, back to Hana. I've been there quite a few times. It's best to go early--around 5:30, right when they open. When I've gotten there around 5:30-5:45, I haven't had to wait in line. Otherwise, it gets pretty packed and you'll probably end up waiting. Everything I've ever had here is good. Salmon nigiri is my favorite, and theirs is delicious. The salmon is so buttery and flavorful, and not nasty and fishy tasting like at some places. They put pieces of lemon on each piece of fish, which makes the flavor come out in a delightful way. Every roll I've had has been delicious. I really like the shrimp tempura roll, and the Hana roll (which is similar) is also good. Those are the two rolls I've had there most recently. They also do takeout--so I get takeout sushi here when I'm stressed from work and feel like splurging. It's always worth it. Their squid salad is also delish, and so is the pork gyoza. As for the service, it's always been great every time I've been there. We've had the same waiter the past few times--not sure of his name, but he's kind of hipstery and has dark hair. He's always very friendly and helpful. Good to know--it's BYOB. But I had a problem once--I brought a Jack Daniels brand malt liquor beverage--similar to a Smirnoff Ice or something. I guess the owner thought it was pink whiskey, because they wouldn't let us drink it. But, they're cool with beer & wine. The waiter said he'd look into drinks like the ones I brought to find out if they're ok under the liquor license that the restaurant has, so I'm not sure if that rule has changed or not. I definitely recommend Hana. I plan to go back again ASAP.\n",
      "We went here last night, Friday. Walked in, jammed, figured it would be a long wait......surprise, within 15 minutes we were at the counter - which was an awesome place to luck into sitting. Our waitperson, Carol - outstanding!! - guided us through the extensive menu......as usual when we're new to somewhere, we over-order.....but oh so good. Sushi was killer - best I've had since Honolulu. Love the BYOB - our Chardonnay was a tad warmish by the time we got seated, but staff brought over an ice bucket (classy!)..... We'll definitely be back - maybe just won't order so much. Agreed with some reviewers can be a tad pricey - but given the quality, I don't mind paying........worth a visit if you have shied away so far.\n",
      "I have always heard of a bento box, but never seen one before until today for lunch. It was quite tasty. It was kinda fun having one we thought. Looking over the menu, they are quite expensive for what I am used to with Sushi. I know its Phoenix, and Sushi is probably pretty hard to come by, but to me this sushi was just average. We had a spicy tuna roll while waiting for our bento boxes and we both agreed it was just ok. A rainbow roll here goes for about 15$ which we both thought this was on the high side compared to some other places we visit. The service was excellent and their staff was very friendly. Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch.\n",
      "I am a sucker for Japanese restaurants with a Japanese speaking staff. They also allow patrons to bring their own sake and beer in, since they do not offer any, without a corking fee. Just walking distance across the intersection is a French grocery store that sells wine, sake, and Japanese beer. For appetizers we got the agedashi tofu (not too salty but very hot!), miso Ramen without butaniku (for meat avoiders!), and for nigiri sushi we got halibut, yellow tail, scallop, and albacore. As far as the fish goes my favorite was the halibut - very succulent! I do recommend getting some add ons for the Ramen because it's just noodle, broth, and a couple naruto otherwise. But, the broth was flavorful and the noodles weren't overdone or undercooked. Also, as soon as we sat down we were offered a couple bites of poki nacho...like a true izakaya serving otsumami (finger food)! I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for a some what un-americanized Japanese restaurant with good sushi grade fish. *Side note, the rolls didn't look particularly exciting but we were full with our 1 app, 1 entrée, and 6 pieces of nigiri. I'll be back!\n",
      "Visiting from southern CA and made a great choice from Yelp's review. The service was great and the quality of fish was great. Just know it's BYOB.\n",
      "Some good Japanese food here. The sushi has always been good and the sashimi as well. The ramen is no joke and will scratch the itch for sure. Not on the menu, they have made us okonomiyaki and katsudon on request and it is always spot on and tasty.\n",
      "Moved into Midtown last year. We loved our sushi place in the northwest valley and now Hana is our new favorite sushi place. The yellowtail was amazing and so was the Hana roll with asparagus. Icing on the cake.... BYOB!!!!\n",
      "Very nice authentic Japanese food in Phoenix!!! This place is small and intimate, the staff are very nice, and the food is creative and high quality. BYOB, don't forget.\n",
      "This place is not cheap, but is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. Fish is fresh and flavors are good. Tempura is excellent. Toro and yellowtail are very good, though the yellowtail is sometimes better than at other times (but that must do with the seasons, not the restaurant). Service is efficient.\n",
      "Even though the restaurant is very small and very busy on Friday night at 7 in the evening, our party of two was seated in about fifteen minutes. After we were seated, the service was amazing. We didn't have to wait for our drinks to be refilled, and the sushi didn't take long to get to us after we ordered. The sushi itself is phenomenal, I recommend the eel nigiri! Requires no soy sauce or wasabi, it's perfect the way it is! My boyfriend doesn't usually like seafood but it was amazing, and then we found out it was because they used Grade A fish. I can't wait for our next sushi night!\n",
      "Thanks to Yelp, I found this place and ventured off last night. What a great way to start the well needed/deserved weekend...with a fantastic meal! We arrived about 6:30pm and were seated after only a few minute wait. Our waiter was Nick and he was both helpful and dead on with his recommendations. I had forgotten that it was BYOB so the waiter quickly directed me to a liquor store across the street...nice We pretty much left the ordering up to him and here is what we had. Toro Tataki....basically a loin of toro rolled in seasoning, seared and sliced thin. Awesome. We followed that with a special call Lil Dino....was a roll w Shrimp inside, thinly sliced scallop on top and a spicy sauce on top of that and then quickly baked...Unbelievable. Next, we had a few pieces of sushi.... giant mackerel and red snapper. Both had great flavor and texture...fresh, sweet and soft as butter! Fresh Grilled Squid w Ginger Soy Sauce....need I say more? Yum We usually pass on dessert but figured we should try one more thing since everything had been awesome! Wasabi Vanilla Ice Cream....tasted like it sounded and with fresh wasabi on top, we could spice it up even more. Overall, this place rocks....we will absolutely get back there before long. (maybe even try the Shabu Shabu they have on Sundays!) Go, let the wait staff guide you and enjoy!\n",
      "The best ramen place in Phoenix so far, I tried several ramen places around Phoenix and Tempe area, and I found this place is my favorite. At that time, I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, OMG their broth was soooo good .. I also ordered salmon nigiri, the meat is so tender and delicious. I definitely will come back\n",
      "Awesome spicy tuna rolls, not a lot of hotties, kind of a neighborhood low key joint, family's n kid's, got to keep the cursing in check, oh bring our own wine too.\n",
      "So far so good. Went there for lunch and got a bento sushi lunch special. Will go back for dinner and update review as necessary, but first impressions were solid. Very fresh and delicious sushi.\n",
      "oh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...visualize peeps: Its the happy dance! You freakin' yelpers made me look like a rock star for picking this place for a lunch meeting. I said, uh, no Stingray, lets go HERE. It was a pleasure. We ordered sashimi, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, yellow tail and volcano rolls. It was all good and very fresh. We especially enjoyed the volcano and at the end of our meal, our server suggested the dynamite roll for a return visit. We were still hungry and stoked so we ordered it right then. It was amazing and delicious. For our lunch the service was spot on and really friendly. I totally enjoyed the sushi chef and helper thanking us for coming in. I can't think of anything that would have improved the experience. YAY!\n",
      "Based on yelp reviews, I decided to go here and try a new sushi restaurant. When you walk in, the restaurant is small and crowded so I was thinking, \"Great. We are going to be waiting forever for a seat.\" There was a big group waiting for a table and I was not happy because I was starving. Luckily, we asked for a table for 2 so they had a table for us. The service was quick, efficient, and they were friendly. We started off with edadame, then this wonton chips which were delicious! They were like chinese nachos. The sushi was fresh and good. I was quite impressed. The parking lot is a private lot and parking is not an issue. There is also an outside patio, but it looks quite small as well. Prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back when I get a sushi craving.\n",
      "*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby. enter, Hana. first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality. first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start. the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough. our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head. he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house. I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.\n",
      "Hana is amazing. The food is outstanding. I have had sushi, noodle dishes, steak, as well as many other things off the menu and all have been delightful. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Japanese food. Check it out!\n",
      "Excellent sushi and sashimi - as good as anything I had in Japan. Very fresh, premium food, presented elegantly = authentic Japanese experience. The place is a bit small, just a line of tables along the wall, plus a low bar to sit at. So you might wait a few minutes for a table, but its very worth it. Just so everyone is clear about BYOB - we were a little nervous to walk in with a bag of wine bottles, but its completely OK. They will provide wine glasses for you, and a corkscrew if you need it. They will let you bring wine, beer, sake, basically anything isn't distilled liquor. So don't bring in vodka and mixers. If you order enough sushi, they will put it on a wood \"boat\". Also, some entrees and rolls come out with a flaming sugar cube - a nice, fun touch. We'll be back many, many times.\n",
      "Very disappointed with OUR overall portions & inflated price. Our sashimi portions were thinly shaved slivers... They were almost as thin as the ginger slices - most of them ripped and transparent. The sashimi pics that others have posted on FB and here on Yelp, look large and generous. That is not what we got! Perhaps they were selfish with us because we weren't regulars. Maybe they give bigger portions to other folks. I don't know. My husband and I were excited to go there late June 2013. It was our second time there in the course of 3 years. The first time, we brought our 1 year old boy with us and we were treated \"carefully\" by the older woman. She kept an eye on us as if she was worried our boy would throw food or be noisy. He behaved well and we left satisfied. I had recently been reading reviews and viewing pics on the super fresh sashimi. We were also excited to bring our own sake and beer. We had always forgotten in the past. This time, we did not bring out boy. We did bring our own booze but our bill was outrageous when we were all done even without alcohol. We ordered lots of sashimi - six pieces each: halibut -$12, Octopus at $10, striped bass at $10. Also had a Vegas at $11.50, & Rainbow roll - I don't recall how much they charged for that one. Anyway our bill was over $60 and they charged us $1.50 each for splitting the bill! EACH of us. That is cheap! There were no sashimi combos offered on menu. Must order each sashimi separately. We are used to being lavished with giant chunks/slices of sashimi at Ah So on Bell. We are regulars there. Maybe that is why we get so much there. Hana was not generous with fish at all especially the halibut. Paper-thin! We will not be going back to Hana. The ambience was fine. Chefs were a little serious and gruff. Servers seemed gruff too. Rushed the bill. Their price was just not worth what we got. The rolls and the portions of sashimi were just way too small. We left hungry. Not many sushi places in that area. Cherry Blossom on 14th Street and Camelback is near. They are more generous.\n",
      "We had sushi, and it was very good, but logistics are a problem. They don't take reservations, so we waited 1/2 an hour for a table (no place to sit, so we stood with about 15 other people). Then, once we were seated, it took almost 15 minutes more for someone to even take our order, so we didn't eat for more than an hour after we got there. As I said, the food is very good (not the greatest I've ever had, but still good) ... but I'm not sure it's worth an hourlong wait to eat it. Next time, we'll go at an off time, or wait for them to expand their space.\n",
      "Finally go in here after all the great feedback i have heard. The food was good. We split a bento and a few pieces of sushi on the side. the fish was all very fresh and nicely presented. Service was spiffy. The special board has lots on it which we did not explore onthis visit but will on a next visit. Prices are towards the higfher end for the sushi/sashimi but there are also a lot of other great japanese dishes on the menu. Would be fine to take a non-fish person there. One minor complaint was the tea. A place like this should have decent tea, they served us a grocery grade oolong that was not very good and took away from the experience.\n",
      "Very cold environment.. looks like a takeout chinese place rather than a sushi restaurant... albacore was not fresh, portions are decent, overall quality is poor and I have have much better sushi for that $ here\n",
      "I went in for lunch after work on the recommendation of a Coworker. I ordered some pork Gyoza, Takoyaki, and a bowl of Yakibuto Ramen in Miso broth. All the food was fantastic. The gyoza was great by itself, but even better with the sauce provided. The Takoyaki was very hot, and the first piece cooked my mouth a bit, but was worth it so I have no regrets! I would definitely order it again. The Ramen came with an option of a variety of broth options. I went with the Miso broth on the waitresses recommendation and it was great. The portion was large and with the other food beforehand I was unable to finish the entire bowl. The waitress was very helpful and friendly as well. Overall it was a great experience and I would absolutely return for lunch again to try out their other dishes and some of the other broth options for their Ramen. Give them a try if you are in the area!\n",
      "The food may be good but the prices are not close to $$ (i.e. $11-$30). When two pieces of Maguro nigiri sushi are $10, there's no way you can get out of there for under $30. Prices are more in the $$$$ range for a sushi dinner and drink.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this place. My husband and I went here on our first date and have never had a bad experience with regards to their service or food. Until tonight... We went for a Valentine's Day dinner since my husband is a chef and will be working tomorrow and were delighted to try their Walu special. It was absolutely phenomenal, cooked perfectly and delicious. However.... Walu is also known as escolar had my husband known that it was escolar we would never have ordered the fish. We got home only to have extreme intestinal issues that are commonly associated with eating this fish (Google escolar). We called the restaurant to speak with a manager to let them know that their servers should say what the fish is... Escolar when letting patrons know the specials for the night and got a bit of attitude. Under normal circumstances I would give the maximum amount of stars but considering I am married to my toilet for the next few days one could say it's unethical to serve customers something that is known for giving people who eat it horrible stomach issues. Escolar is banned in Japan for crying out loud and I would have preferred to have made a conscious decision on whether I wanted to consume it.\n",
      "This place was a bit hard to find since Google maps doesn't say which side of the street it's on traveling on 7th and the signage is fairly small, but other than that I really enjoyed this spot. Drinks: BYOB, so not much else to say. The water was served in plastic as you'd expect in a reasonably priced place, but the water was fresh and didn't taste like tap. Food: Pork bone ramen. The broth was delicious and the noodles were tender but didn't fall apart , you had to chew or slurp the whole noodle. I recommend getting the soft boiled egg with it because the yolk makes the broth fairly rich which I like. Sushi. The salmon nigiri was buttery and fresh and the rice was good, not dry. Those were the standouts. We also had the Hana roll (deep fried goodness) and spicy tuna which were both good but not stand-out. Service: We were greeted at the door by a friendly guy with a cool haircut who advised a table would be ready soon. After about 30 seconds he apologized and said the table was not available but that there were two seats for me and my girl at the bar. I prefer the sushi bar anyway so no issue. Server. After seating we were greeted by our server who was friendly and gave us a moment to decide the order. She recommended the pork bone over the miso ramen which turned out to be great advise. Over the course of the meal she returned frequently to quickly check in, then let us return to our conversation. We were served by her as well as the sushi chef handing the nigiri and rolls directly to us which was cool. Staff was constantly circling the tables taking empty plates and it was a bit loud when chef and servers would talk shop, but felt necessary to keep the place moving at a good pace and it added to the ambiance which felt alive and fun, almost exciting to sit and watch. Takeaway: Get the pork bone ramen and bring a bottle of white wine for a nice date at a good price.\n",
      "Great date night spot. Love the small local feel. Amazing sushi and shooters. No alcohol though- so BYOB FYI. But regardless of that- sushi was on point!!\n",
      "I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 but unfortunately that's not possible and I felt the experience leaned more toward 3 stars. So first off we got there on a busy Saturday and it was packed and extremely loud, to the point where you have to yell at the people across your table and can barely hear your server. Then we learned that it was BYOB, but luckily there's a corner market nearby that you can acquire alcohol at. We were told a 15 min wait and that it was a \"high guess\" but it still took about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad. Finally after getting our table and beer we looked over the menu which had a good amount of items on it and were all very tasty, albeit a bit pricey (20$ for 6 pieces of mackerel are you serious?!). Our appetizers came and they were very good although they were all fried and that's pretty hard to mess up, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and would recommend them. By this point it really starts sinking in that it's very hard to talk and have conversation. I don't mind a rowdy atmosphere at a bar where it's expected and part of the experience, but at a delicate sushi restaurant that doesn't even serve alcohol, I was kind of shocked at the volume. You'll think I'm joking until you're in there and realize that there's no padding or insulation whatsoever and that sound is just reverberating off the walls. It was something we dealt with for the time being but when I remember this place I'm going to remember how loud it was and how happy we were to sit in a silent car for 30 min afterwards, it's pretty crazy. Our sushi arrived with a cute little flaming sugar cube on top of a cucumber slice which was very cool and unique, although we ordered a lot of sushi and they put it on every time so by the third plate, the novelty wears a bit thin. All that aside, I really think the saving grace of this place is the food. If my mouth doesn't mistake me they have fresh wasabi instead of the pre-packaged stuff and the food tasted very fresh. My udon tempura dish took a while to come out of the kitchen but when it did it was very flavorful, rich, and delicious. If I could review different parts of the experience I would say the sushi and food is a 4/5 rather than a 3/5, but I'm reviewing the restaurant and not just the food. The service was pretty great I must say, but it's kind of dampened when I have to yell my order at you and when you ask me things I almost have to resort to lip reading (yes it's like being at a concert almost). I'm nitpicking a little bit because it wasn't the services fault and I would actually give them a 4.5/5 because they were that good. So you may be wondering why after claiming the food is great and the service even better I'm giving it 3 stars. Bear with me when I tell you that I will never go here on a weekend ever again. There are many sushi restaurants in the valley that are just as proficient and delicious without such a horrific ambience. If you're going alone to enjoy a quick meal you will -have- to sit at the sushi bar due to a rule posted on a sign in the front, and when you're sitting at a bar, with no alcohol, and everyone screaming around you, it really kind of ruins the experience. If you're looking for a place to go during the week I might check it out again because the food and service is good, but all the other small details seem to have been missed when it comes to having a truly fulfilling and extraordinary sushi experience. If you're nearby, give it a go, but steel your nerves because it might test your patience to the limit.\n",
      "The owner was nice and accomodating. The prices were a little too high, but within range of most sushi restaurants. When the food arrived, we were a little dissapointed. This place and been highly recommended and we drove across town to get there expecting the best sushi in town. The sashimi was good, but not as fresh as typically offered by our neighborhood sushi restaurant. In addition, it was not cut by the chef correctly, leaving it thin with an odd texture. The rolls were much better, but were on the small side. However, the restaurant was charming, the service was great, and the food was otherwise good. I can see why this place is always busy with regulars. It's just not worth the drive across town when we have other more convenient options that we prefer.\n",
      "Love, love, love!!! This place is AMAZING! Spectacular service, food & it's BYOB. Sushi is fresher than fresh. We had a mix of sushi and kitchen items, it was ALL delicious!\n",
      "Always fabulous!! Been spoiled for any other sushi...just a fact! Seriously, if u haven't been...I'm sorry....ur missin out.... Family fav... love, love LOVE...did I mention love?? Love u guys!!\n",
      "I had to reflect on our dining experience at Hana before writing a review. We had great company while dining here and that certainly colors the experience as a whole. First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share! After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars. They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short. We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only. We started with miso soup. It was very *(salads arrive)* good. Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up. We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones. I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well. The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious. Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner. They arrived and were nice and hot. The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful. I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy. The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most. Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience. The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian. Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other. We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other. I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue. The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table. Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option. Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal. In summary: the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\\\cold//\\\\warm//\\\\cold//\\\\warm//\\\\cold.\n",
      "I had such high expectations. I lived in Japan for four years. Lived and ate in NYC, around the US and Europe. But I was underwhelmed. The fish was fresh as you would expect. I had two rolls, including the tuna tataki roll. The amount of tuna was very little. The rice on both was rolled looser than it should be. My hub's nigiri was fine, the tako and ika were especially good. But was it worth the hour drive and the30% larger bill? No.\n",
      "Went on my birthday last Wednesday for the first time and it was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday. Ordered the spicy tuna roll, quail egg shooter, hamachi Kama, and some squid nigiri. The spicy tuna was good giving a little extra per piece after the sushi was already cut. Quail egg shooter was delicious. Hamachi Kama was disappointing because it was over cooked and burned at some parts leaving certain parts of the yellowtail collar to be dry and not as mouth melting as it should be. The squid nigiri was good but not the best. I was disappointed they gave me a specials sheet but was out of some things I wanted to try. Especially the monk fish liver. The service was very quick and friendly. I would definitely come back and eat here again to try other things on the menu\n",
      "After spending our entire lives eating gooooood Asian food in California and the summer in Asia being spoiled by all the authentic delicacies, we were super excited to discover this gem in Phoenix! Hana has the best sushi in AZ, hands down. The yellowtail sashimi is our favorite, because it melts in your mouth. But all the other sushi is really good, including the salmon and spicy tuna roll. The sashimi is so flavorful and definitely tastes fresh. The prices are a bit high, but that wasn't a dealbreaker for us since we know we're in Arizona, sushi comes at a price. The quality of fish here is definitely worth the price, though. Tonkotsu Ramen is wonderful, as well. You have to order the egg on the side, but the pork and egg (if added) are cooked perfectly and the portions for the ramen is huge. It's a good, filling meal at a great price. Definitely recommended!\n",
      "I have found my new favorite sushi spot. I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive. You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven. The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. \"Hey, fire!\" I thought. It was a nice touch. Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe. Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.\n",
      "Me so Hana! I've taken my brothers and sisters here for dinner on multiple occasions and we always had a great dinner. While its a small place with maybe 10 tables and bar seating, it is packed with fresh flavors. We sat at the bar last night and while we were waiting, the sushi chef handed us a plate. It was a cucumber/crab salad on a fried wonton crisp. We ordered a bowl of their tempura udon, the Hana roll, the tempura shrimp roll, the spicy tuna roll and the squid salad. The udon broth was seasoned perfectly and a great compliment to the tempura battered veggies and shrimp. The squid salad was tender, lightly seasoned and full of textures. A must-try. This is the only place that actually makes the spicy tuna roll spicy. The food/fish is fresh and the staff is uber-friendly. I like coming here for good sushi, especially since most of Phoenix/Scottsdale usually is full of trendy or not-so-good sushi places.\n",
      "We've been here before when it was so crowded and overly noisy and just made for a disastrous dining experience. We've also been here when the other diners have been more reserved and understood how to use their inside-voices. Definitely, I prefer the latter; definitely. Hana is a good value for the cost of dinner. One can bring in one's own wine, beer or sake which is a terrific deal. I've taken in a flask full of sake, warmed up in my lap, for sake bombers and didn't get any funny looks. The fish is fresh (or at least we've been fortunate enough to not have any freshness issues) and brought out in a timely manner. I understand we missed their 2-year anniversary. Bummer. I am happy to see they made it past this threshold. Maybe I'll see you there tonight?\n",
      "Always fresh and delicious. Also, each time we have gone we have gotten excellent service!! This is now one of our \"go to\" spots.\n",
      "Hana is a great place for sushi. For starters, the agadashi tofu bowl is fabulous & actually very filling! We ordered an array of rolls, all very fresh, but I was bummed we were one of the tables that didn't get it presented in a boat! Since it was very crowded, our dinner lasted until close which at that point we felt a bit rushed by the staff to head out. Regardless of that, the sushi was great & I love that it's BYOB.\n",
      "Nigiri: great. As to be expected. Sashimi: fresh, very tasty. Well presented. Service: waitress running around. Friendly enough just difficult to get attention. Food dido come out quickly though. Experience: sat at the bar - really cramped due the number of people there. Unfortunately lost a bit of ambiance. I'd go back for the food.\n",
      "Yum. Authentic Japanese Sushi. The specials are amazing. Remember to BYOB.\n",
      "Well were to start? It might be because I just had some of the best sushi on the plant at Tei Tei in Dallas but I wasn't impressed here in the slightest. My highlights: -Oolong tea -Gari Low lights: -Rice, it was almost like mochi, just a gooey mess. -Fish was VERY cold, it was almost like it was almost to the point of freezing and then served. Thus leaving the fish with little to no taste. -Loads of scallions on everything, rolls and nigiri. I assume to give it some flavor. -Nigiri all had loads of ponzu on it. Once again to give it a flavor. This place has numerous good reviews and I will tell all of you to look harder! I had better Japanese in Scottsdale last year, I think it was at Kyoto. UPDATE UPDATE- Best sushi in PHX is far and away Yasu. Treat yourself and see what the real deal is like. You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "Quite very good! We came there Friday night as a small group of 8 people. Service was terrific. I would be hard pressed to find more accommodating personnel! Every one is super friendly without being too obnoxious, that is hard to find. Its also BYOB, and that is a great plus! They will be happy to chill your beer and bring out a cooler for the table to your wine or sake. Super nice! Food was excellent too. One of the friends referred to it as \"Best Ever!\", but i do not know about that. It's surely VERY good - fresh, good quality, well prepared. All top notch. It was a good experience and while it was somewhat pricey, i will not hesitate to drop by if i am around there. \"I like!\"\n",
      "Mediocre at best. Rice used for sushi was good. Steamed dumplings were horrible. Noodles had almost no flavor. Service was sub-par. No need to come here again. I would recommend trying something else.\n",
      "If you love Sushi, try the Hamachi Kama.....hmmmmm inspired to eat!\n",
      "Awesome awesome fish, ridiculously prompt service, friendly & chatty servers and chefs! Visited Hana while in town on a business trip. I eat lots of sushi... And I have to say I was impressed. Hana delivers as good as any major metropolitan sushi joint... And then some! Sat at the bar by myself and ordered a pile of nigiri. The toro and sake were amazing, as was the yellowtail. Do not miss the unagi...it was off the hook/chain! I love the 1 and 2 star reviews on this place... Sorry you didn't get lemon wedges...Sorry you don't like paying for extraordinary and extraordinarily fresh fish. This place is awesome - will definitely be visiting again when I'm back in town. I'll be dreaming of that toro until then...\n",
      "After living here for 6years, Hana is the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, period. In fact, it's so good, I will not eat sushi anywhere else now. Now, let me give you some context so you may determine if this review is for you: Do you dip your rice in soy sauce? Do you add \"wasabi\" to your soy sauce? Do you eat rolls other than basic seaweed, rice, fish? Do you think the green paste is wasabi? Do you call the fish part of the nigiri, \"sushi\"? If you said YES to any of the above (don't lie), this review is NOT for you. Otherwise, read on.... Hamachi Kama was brilliant; perfectly cooked and delicious. Yellowtail handroll was utterly amazing. The yellowtail handroll is my go-to. At Hana the fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and had the perfect fish to rice ratio which is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I also tried the halibut, striped bass, crab, masago with quail egg, and salmon. All the fish was the freshest, best tasting I have eaten since moving from Los Angeles. The sunomono was even amazing! Help-wise, the service was spot-on. Extremely friendly and very attentive. I can't say enough good things about this place. Disclaimer: I have yet to try Yasu, which I hear is amazing as well, but compared to every other sushi joint in Phoenix, THIS is the spot to go to. F everywhere else.\n",
      "Came here on a recommendation since I was craving good ramen. This place doesn't have the variety that I assumed but the one ramen dish was still pretty decent for Phoenix. Had the takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and that was actually pretty well done. The sushi was pretty good too but nothing amazing. I'm intrigued that they have okonomiyaki which is not commonly found so I will definitely be back to try other things\n",
      "Just tried this place for the first time and was very impressed! If you don't like sushi probably not the place fore you. Sashami and rolls were excellent and very fresh! The place was very clean and service was excellent. You can't get a better value for the price. We went at lunch time and will definately try again. Not for large crowds.\n",
      "I contacted the owners about making a donation to a fundraiser and they were more than happy to help out. I took a friend with me to have lunch and pick up the gift certificate. We were both blown away at the Hana Bento box ($15 and I was stuffed with leftovers). We split two desserts, the creme filled tempura and deep fried mango ice cream. Both were great, though the chocolate sauce was almost too much sweetness. The waiter was very attentive, and when we asked to split the check with two cards he was overly-apologetic about explaining the $1.50 fee per card, which we were happy to pay. I've heard amazing things about this place and I live nearby, so I'm kicking myself for not having gone sooner. It is so fantastic and Lori and Lynn are philanthropists to boot! Thanks so much you guys!\n",
      "Don't even bother reading any more reviews. Get in your car right now and go! This place is phenomenal. I have lived by the beach my whole life, starting with a Russian fishing town and ending with San Diego. I never thought that I would find the freshest, melt-in-your-mouth sashimi in a strip mall in Phoenix. I know fish. This is good fish. Also, try their tempura veggies and shrimp. Best I ever had. The atmosphere is awesome, everyone is just in a good mood...because they are having the best sushi Phoenix has to offer.\n",
      "I absolutely love this place. The sushi is pretty good, though I have places I prefer for sushi. But I have yet to find a place that serves better squid. I've gone there just for the Ika Kara Age. Their menu isn't huge but what they offer is good. It's also not a large place so you may have to wait to be seated depending on the day and time. I've been here at least a dozen times though and I'm never disappointed. Their seaweed salad and bento boxes are also very good.\n",
      "I really like this place. Very tiny on the inside with about four tables on the patio. It's BYOB so that's kind of fun. I really liked the food, I thought everything we tried was fresh and tasty. It was served on a big wooden boat. Tempura was average and nothing special. I liked seeing the sushi chef and his helper making the food. He was smiling the entire time we were here, and in some small way I think it made the food taste better. The service was all over the place, sometime they were all over us, and other times we had to flag them down. A true hidden gem that's a thousand times better than a \"RA\" style sushi joint.\n",
      "Thanks Hana for providing sushi to the central Phoenix crowd. Dinner last night was consistent with previous experiences. Fried oyster appetizer crunchy and succulent. Accompanying green adequately dressed. Tempura was crisp, not greasy, and a perfect match for the soy broth and soba noodles. Very tasty! But Hana, this is how I meant for the food to arrive. I did not want my entree of noodles, followed by my appetizer of oysters and then the greens presented as an after thought. Unfortunately, the three other diners that I was with had the same experience. Food arrived randomly. Rush! Rush! It was like Russian roulette. Then as we were settling into our meal, our server arrived with the check. Whoa Hana! I know you have a small location and Friday is busy, but let me enjoy the good food that you serve instead of trying to turn a table.\n",
      "Honestly, not good. The fish was fine in terms of quality but the knife cuts were sub par at best. I could be drunk and make better cuts. For those who know little about sushi I'm sure this is \"awesome bro\" but my experience with sushi is a lot more deep than most of the patrons here, I'm pretty sure..... the miso soup was fine. The rolls were fine. Actually nothing was great or even good. It got two stars because of the service, which was very good. My advice to the owners, lose the hipsters who think they are cool and get some sushi chefs who know how to correctly cut fish and serve it appropriately. Anyone who knows anything about sushi will understand this review.\n",
      "Amazing food! Authentic Japanese izakaya feel. Family run, good service, amazing food. Be sure to ask what are the Market prices for some delicacies, some are pricy but amazingly fresh and delicious. AND you can take your own alcohol (inside only) without paying any fees for it. Go to restaurant for date night!\n",
      "This was our first time here, my stepson and I brought my wife for Mother's Day. We brought a bottle of wine with us and sat down to one of the most amazing meals I have had. Service was great, but the food... O.M.G. the food. The sushi was great, we had the Curry Udon which hands down is one of the best things I have put in my mouth in years. This reataurant is a must visit. Don't wait, just go.\n",
      "This is the best Japanese restaurant in town hands down. Everything on the menu is awesome, atmosphere is fun and intimate, service is great. This place has a good vibe to it and the food is authentic. BYOB is a great feature too.\n",
      "Best Katsu Curry in Phoenix. It's a bit of a small portion compared to other Japanese Restaurants or Asian Fusion Resto, but it's worth it.\n",
      "I really wanted to love this place, and in my opinion it fell short. Maybe a three star rating is too harsh, because at the end of the day it is one of the better sushi spots I have been to in Phoenix. However, it is still worlds away from my favorite (see my other reviews). Anyways, a couple of things happened at our lunch that dropped my review from 4 to 3 stars. First, despite not serving alcohol, my party of two wracked up a $100 lunch tab...so it isn't cheap. Second, while we were eating they were cleaning the restaurant with a very offensive industrial type cleaner. The smell completely overwhelmed the delicate flavor of some of the fish. Finally, we ordered a toro tataki.,,which was prepared with a kitchen torch. Something must have went wrong because the fish took on an overwhelming flavor of propane gas.\n",
      "I am Asian from Hawaii and know good, fresh sushi. The menus (at table and written on boards) are overwhelming so went with assorted nigiri ,Chef's Special recommended by our attentive waitress. It was fresh and I also liked the baby eggplant dish. Next time will give the owner our budget (as suggested by another Yelp review) and let her order for us to experiment with their other delicacies that I wouldn't recognize from the names. The photos on their website show such an assortment but no identifiable names to take to the restaurant to order. Overall very good experience, but do not order the green tea ice cream - tastes like soap! Green tea ice cream tastes like green tea! BYOB is great plus! Will bring our own sake cups for ambiance instead of drinking sake out of teacups.\n",
      "Ate lunch here again. AS always, great service and food!\n",
      "The sushi isn't terrible, but I really don't think it deserves 4 stars that everyone has put here. If you really like sushi and care about getting 6-8 pieces of sushi (as advertised) as opposed to 5, do not come here. I moved to Phoenix from California and have not tried many other sushi restaurants in the area, but I know I will not come back here. This was definitely an underwhelming and disappointing experience.\n",
      "I've been to Hana about 6 times, once at lunch and the rest always at dinner. Each time I have been there I have seen the place full and the diners mostly happy. On two of the occasions we came in with large tables, about 8 people. Frankly the place is a bit small for that, but they accommodated us cheerfully and took very good care of us. Our last visit, on Saturday about a week ago was with 8 people. When we arrived the place, including the sushi bar and patio, was full and they had two other 8 tops. We were seated in about 30 minutes (they don't take reservations but if you have a large party and call ahead they do their best) and were immediately given drinks. Our waitress VOLUNTEEERED to split the check (unheard of!) and did so perfectly into four and with great care. While we were waiting they took our wine and Sake and Chilled it for us and brought it out immediately after we were seated, even splitting the sake into warm and chilled carafes at their own suggestion. The food came out quickly despite the full house and was well received; about 6 of our guests that night were first timers. Every morsel of every dish was eaten and then we ordered more. I see other complaints about the salads and etc. in other reviews, I can't comment I have never eaten anything but sushi there and it has always been excellent, fresh and carefully prepared. My favorites: Dynamite Scallops, Tempura Roll, Spider Roll, Vegas Roll, Poki Chips, Caterpillar roll. It also cracks me up that they sometimes play MXC on the flat screen at the back of the restaurant. Also, the last two times we took 3 or four bottles of wine and were not charged a corkage fee, I assume that this was a courtesy as we spent a couple of hundred dollars on food, but it was appreciated and noticed.\n",
      "Yes it's BYOB, but if you go with a group your sushi COMES ON A BOAT WITH FIRE!! annnnd the caterpillar role is shaped like a catipillar with carrot eyes and celery slivers for antenna. Too cool for school!\n",
      "Feeling adventurous, we grabbed some Kirin and headed down to Hana. 1) We started with the Green Lip Mussels. INCREDIBLE...best I have ever had. No exaggeration. They were GREAT. 2) Next we tried the Lobster Roll Special. Awesome. A huge roll with a giant piece of lobster on each piece. 3) Moving on to the Dynamite Roll...OMG (you have to say it like a 16 year when she gets the keys to daddy's BMW.) This was the highlight. It hardly qualifies as Sushi. A giant steaming pile of crab, scallops, cheese, and sauces over some type of roll. Wow. Our server was EXCELLENT when he was around. He spent a considerable amount of time explaining several of the specials. He was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever had. To be honest, the only negative of our experience was that he only stopped by our table three times in just over an hour...ouch. If it weren't for having to flag him down to order or get our check, I would have given Hana 5 Stars. I love the fact that they are BYOB. This is a huge plus. Give this place a shot. I will definitely be back...many times. GREAT FIND.\n",
      "I love this place! Great deserts, quick service once seated. It's small, and there can be a little line/wait during the busy hours...\n",
      "Have been here a number of times over the years and it's been constantly good. I always get sushi and sushi rolls so I can't say anything about the other dishes. The fish has always been fresh and well prepared. The rolls are consistently good. Always a crowd, be prepared to wait. Get it to go if you want to enjoy the goodness in your own home! Service has always been good with friendly hosts and servers. BYOB/W is great since restaurants tend to mark up the booze so much. Gets loud inside, but that's how it goes.\n",
      "We're regulars at what I strongly believe to be the best sushi in the Valley, and I've been meaning to write a glowing review on Yelp for some time now. The staff is incredibly friendly, making the service seem effortless. Its one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix--BYOB. When you arrive, they put your beer or Reisling in the fridge, and you get it extra cold as they seat you. (Keep in mind that its a really small restaurant, and there is often a short wait before being seated.) They have the standard selection of rolls, with a rotating daily selection of specials. The fish is nice and fresh, which isn't necessarily the case with sushi in Arizona. The portions are also generous, and there are a few surprises to the standard rolls. The specials are all generally good, and I think we've tried most all of them. The poke chips (chopped up tuna on tortilla/wonton type chips) were a recent miss, but other than that, highly recommended to just let your server suggest what ever is the freshest that day. Another secret about Hana--if you reserve 24-48 hours ahead, they will shop at the market, and make a custom Sunday night feast for you which you can cook at your table. Its ideal for a large group, and totally seasonal and different than anything on the menu.\n",
      "Ordered the omakase ($40) and a bowl of ramen ($10). Omakase was nothing spectacular and the ramen was bland. I don't see the hype behind this place. Very disappointed considering I live just down the street.\n",
      "HANA IS B.Y.O.B. (And bring some extra to share~!) My friends at Hana Japanese Eatery kick up some killer sushi. I spend a LOT of money on sushi and I am a \"foodie\". I am a fairly advanced sushi eater and can be trusted (You agree B?) I only gave 4 of 5 stars for the following reasons in order of importance: #1: Nobody is perfect so a 5 star just ain't gonna come out of me. (read between the lines). #2: I wish they had a bar, but I don't mind bringing my own. Did somebody say \"Family run, locally owned, neighborhood friendly?\" Yeah, I think this is the thing. If you really like sushi, give this a try, sit at the bar and ask KOJI (Rick) to give you all he has.\n",
      "This is the best.spot in Phoenix. Always fresh and quick if you can find a seat. There's usually at least 4 sushi chefs behind the bar which is a good indicator that this place is for reals!\n",
      "Uhhh... WOW!!! So I went here with a large party of 9 which is a little but difficult at this place, because it's a bit smaller so we had to wait til two tables near each other opened up. Once seated, the service was like a whirlwind! It was just too fast. Lol. Attentitive, but fast... There was no time to sit and relax. You have to look at the menus and decide before you take your next breath! My friends and I were a bit stressed and felt under pressure. Lol. So after looking at the menu, on the specials menu, one item in particular popped out at me, which was the gyu don. I've had gyu don before. Usually around 9 bucks, and I like it a lot, however this pricing was around 16.95. I'm a firm believer of you get what you pay for. Here, it included tofu, mushrooms and thinly sliced beef. The server says it takes a little longer than everyone's but it is worth the wait. And I said okay! And of course, it was the last one to arrive at the table. Oh man! That was pretty delicious!! I loved it. It was like a stew. The broth by itself is kinda salty from soy sauce, but it's fantastic with rice, and the tofu, shrooms, and beef were all so beautifully marinaded because of it! Also, the presentation of my friends' sushi was spectacular! There was a sugar cube that was on fire on this plate of really attractively arranged sushi. So despite being stressed out in the beginning, the food really was impressive. Plus, it's byob so the server said we didn't have to wait to sit to pop open some of our beverages.\n",
      "This review is the splitting image of Jekyll and Hyde: Hana when going for Sushi (specifically makizushi aka rolls--I'm not much for Nigiri or Sashimi) = 3 Stars. When going for Noodles = 5 stars. Last night I went for sushi and I haven't for a really long time because I feel their sushi is quite pricey in comparison to other sushi 'rants and that there's less roll variety... less you brave the under described Specials Menu. Another annoying thing is that the sushi is BIG. In Japan, you are supposed to eat sushi whole, but when we ordered the Hana Roll (Their best standard roll, IMHO), I could cut it into two perfectly sized pieces--if nori was nicely cut-able so in the end it was a disaster on my plate and eaten piece-meal. I told the friend I was dining with that this is the sushi version of eating ribs on a first date... too messy (At times I had Avocado lipstick moments)... but I have to admit, all the contents of the roll were tasty and I liked their eel sauce consistency and proportions (sometimes it can be over slathered and/or runny, drenching the rice till it's rendered un-sticky and difficult to handle. Remember, traditionally, sushi was meant to be eaten by hand... the original Japanese, sandwich if you will. I did enjoy the way it was presented... on a boat with a little pyrotechnic touch. Now on to the*real* good stuff... The Noodles... I WILL SAY THEY HAVE THE BEST RAMEN IN TOWN! My brother, who I describe as a carboholic eater, but more specifically a noodle-holic states it is his favorite in town hands down... and, so do I. It's the broth that does it. And you get SOOOOO much more when you get any of their noodle dishes. You get a starter salad in the best Miso dressing in town, according to my opinion... and, if you get any of the tempura options, you get the SAME amount of tempura you would get as an appetizer order for $6.95--In Hawaii, you usually only get 1-2 pieces of ebi tempura--to dredge in your bowl of noodles! (Note, the bowl of Tempura Soba is $9.25). It is so hard for me to NOT get this meal because it's warm and comforting for a girl from the islands, and it's own little 3 course meal for one low price! Hard to beat, but I do struggle when ordering because their Yakibuta Ramen (Japanese BBQ pork w/ egg noodles) is also SO good. I've tried to make the pork at home, but it doesn't come out nearly as soft and tasty as theirs... it's heaven! (Good thing you can order it as an appetizer!) The ONLY thing that remotely upsets me about the Noodle portion of Hana's menu is the no substitution clause, which is understandable--the chef wants the noodles to be prepared as they are, but oh would I for once want to change the Soba noodles into Ramen Noodles and add the Yakibuta slices into my bowl that already has Tempura in it! Sometimes a girl just wants it all, all, all, ALL! Now on to the peripherals... There appetizer menu is quite broad... I'm hoping to try the oysters and mussels one day... The Agedashi Tofu is piping hot and tasty with the katsuobushi (fish flakes) that move in dramatic ways as the heat rises from the tofu... sort of eye-boggling and entrancing! And don't forget the Miso, Octopus, Squid Salads, Yakibuta and \"Varietous\" Tempura plate... all YUMS UP for me! (It was fun haggling with my friend for the veggies we wanted. I got the Shiso Leaf and he felt he got the better deal acquiring the mushroom). Their Bento Box meals are also a great price for the variety of meal you get, and I'll admit, I would buy their Chicken Katsu if I was jonesin' for it but was too lazy to cook it myself. Lastly dessert... I've only been up for it once (Usually too full from apps or already equipped with desire to cross the road and put my Mary Coyle's Ice Cream cravings to rest), but last night, we went all out and tried the Tempura Ice Cream... of which I was surprised it was Tempura MOCHI Ice Cream... I was just expecting a crunch and then ice cream... instead I found some surprise \"Gumption\" between the two and it made the experience one with strange faces and long tastings and thoughts racing in my head contemplating whether I liked it or not... too long a ponder = the answer: not so much. Nice attempt, but I'd say stick to the subtlety of the Mochi Ice Cream experience! Oh! Almost forgot about service! I must agree with other Yelpers in their spottiness but there is one waiter who has always made a good impression on me. Last night he served us our Ice Cream and since it came with 3 pieces he made a gesture to grab a chair and come join us for the 3rd piece. Another time, he and I enjoyed raving about the awesomeness of the Yakibuta. I also like that he reminds me of those Japanese \"cool kids\" hanging out in Harajuku. So, all in all, a very roller coaster ride through the land of Hana (Flowers). Definite reasons to come back and definite reasons to steer clear. Just depends on what you're in the mood for. Noodles YES, Makizushi, not so much.\n",
      "There are lots of positives to this place, despite what previous reviewers might say: 1. the sushi is good - not overwhelmingly fantastic, but they do have a tasty, fresh selection. Their house rolls are worth trying. 2. you can bring your own beer. saves tons of $$$ - and they don't charge you extra for the glasses. 3. the manager/owner is a very bossy, older Asian woman who gives you a real run for your money. The woman doesn't waste a second, and will tell you what to order if you can't decide, even though you haven't asked. It's entertaining, and I'm always a fan of the pushy Asian mother-types. 4. they serve your sushi in a big fancy boat, which is way too big for the table but satisfies my need for drama in dining experiences. It's a real \"ta-daa!\" at the dinner table. I definitely recommend this place. It's fun, the food is good, and as I said before, you can bring your own beer!\n",
      "Went here for the first time for the BYOB and were impressed! Sitting at the bar we got a small complimentary snack and a unique place setting. Servers were incredibly attentive and friendly throughout our meal. The edamame came out cold which was not ideal but it was followed by yellowtail sashimi which was the best we've had in Arizona. Thick pieces that tasted very fresh. The spicy tuna we ordered had a lot of tuna for the price and was very tasty. The rest of our rolls were the \"special\" rolls and they were good but nothing as good as the freshness of the standard rolls. We are looking forward to returning for more sashimi.\n",
      "This quaint little neighborhood sushi bar has charm that stretches for days. Our group of 4 came here Friday night for dinner and business was bustling. We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table which wasn't so bad considering how busy it was. The menu is very stream lined but the focus is still always dedicated to the freshness and quality of their sushi. We enjoyed salmon sashimi and uni sashimi. The spicy tuna roll was delightful and the spiciness did not overcome the fresh flavor of the tuna. One of my favorites, unagi nigiri, did not disappoint! We definitely plan to return here. Our go-to will most likely be the scallop dynamite, which our friends ordered and we tried and loved. The uni oyster shooters were fun and yummy. It's a great way to introduce people who don't usually eat uni to enjoy the unique melt in your mouth texture. I'm slowly starting to enjoy uni since we order it so much. I think I could get others addicted to it too!\n",
      "I love this place. Service is great and the sushi is delicious. Favorite lunch spot in central phx.\n",
      "Ordered takeout from Hana tonight. First time eating there and was very pleased. Everything was delicious and I will for sure order again. I've lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and never ventured in, I can't believe I've been missing out. Shrimp tempura was delicious, as was the sushi, miso soup, and the ginger salad.\n",
      "bring your own booze! there wasn't any warning on yelp before i went. man, was that a disappointment. otherwise this is a great place with good atmosphere, a friendly staff, and very good sushi. however, the prices are a little on the high side. sushi costs around 2-3 dollars more then most other places and the dishes there are in the 15-25 dollar variety. it's a good place to try, but i can't justify going to it frequently with its prices.\n",
      "I've only been here once and will very likely return. Everything tastes great and service was friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Lovely small restaurant with great dishes, real wasabi. BYOB The Sashimi is a must. Yakitori amazing and great mochi.\n",
      "Amazing place. I'd been here before but trying their food at Devoured reminded me that I needed to come back again soon. We brought our own beer and let them choose our dishes. My favorite was a monkfish pate' with a quail egg on a slice of lemon. What a creative and delicious presentation!\n",
      "Good food. Very crowded. They turn the tables over quickly which is great when you're waiting, but not when you're trying to relax and enjoy dinner. Next time I won't go during peak dinner hours. Spicy tuna was great.\n",
      "This place is great! Fresh fish daily. Well priced & BYOB! What more could you ask for? It is a smaller size restaurant though, so be prepared to wait for a seat. Still, a new fav of mine.\n",
      "I'm a fan....this place serves more Japanese fare....lots of izakaya style, small bites. Not the widest variety of sushi on the menu, but that's okay. Just know that it's not really a sushi bar for huge variety. It gets busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit. It's also BYO, which is maybe the best part!\n",
      "Parking can be rough here, and during busy times, good luck getting a table. But your patience will be rewarded. The sushi specials (on the wipe board) are never to be missed. The regular menu is filled with flavorful and recognizable dishes but Hana does thing their own way, it is always delicious without being tedious. A definate must.\n",
      "They don't accept takeout - doesn't work with postmates.\n",
      "This is one of our favorite sushi places - the people are warm and very open, and the food is incredible! We feel the portions are generous, the treatment authentic enough, and the options for feasting are endless. I am not sure why they got only 4 stars - maybe I am just in love with the fact that we can walk there!\n",
      "Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff, great food, great times.\n",
      "I really feel like I can't write a review that will give Hana the justice and admiration that it truly deserves. It's rare that I find an establishment that I have dined at that really blew my mind in so many ways. Hana is so much more than just a sushi restaurant. It is a place where you can find Japanese Kaiseki dining, there is as much love in the Tempura as there is in the uni and oyster shooter. There is no fluff or fuss over the food here, just super high quality ingredients that have been perfectly balanced the way that the ingredients are meant to be enjoyed. Simple flavors, quality ingredients and lots of love and passion in the kitchen. Japanese cuisine and culture is something that I have always found intriguing. I had the opportunity to chat with one of the owners while there... I really enjoyed hearing about her passion for the restaurant, her travels to Japan and learning more about the amazing chefs that work at Hana. I can't wait to come back to Hana, enjoy more of their delicious food. This place lives up to the hype.... Believe it!\n",
      "We don't to come here as often as we would like since it's a bit of a drive from Gilbert, but Hana is definitely our favorite Japanese restaurant in town. Besides the great food and service, we also love the no-corkage BYOB. We usually bring a white wine, and they make sure to put it in an ice bucket for us. Hana has a good variety of well executed classics and lots of unique specials. The Hana tamago was recently featured in the Republic's food section with good reason. It's a really cool dish featuring a tempura battered soft boiled egg set on top of a delicious creamy sauce. Get it and don't share! I also had the heirloom tomato sashimi a few months ago and loved it. As a vegetarian, it's great to see a sushi chef's attention to detail extended to veggies as well. My husband is the meat eater in the family so he has got to enjoy some awesome seafood dishes. Most recently, he had a beautiful looking lobster dish (his favorite of the night) and an entire grilled squid. He also had high praises for a tuna roll topped with fried garlic as well. We are really looking forward to coming back with friends and family so we can share Hana's goodness.\n",
      "Best fish in town! I once asked the owner what the COG percentage was on his fish, it's slightly over 40%. This is pretty high in the restaurant industry, but it explains why they are on the same par Hatsuhana (midtown) in NYC. I've been coming here since it opened and they have always maintained that quality over the years.\n",
      "Fun environment with delicious food. It was busy on Wednesday night, but we never felt neglected. Sonya, our server, was friendly and really on top of things. Loved the food and prices were pretty fair.\n",
      "If you aren't picky, don't want anything complicated/fancy and just want a trim, then this is the place to be. The price for a haircut is only $19 (without wash, but they do blow-dry and style your hair to make it more presentable)! I have gotten my hair cut twice now and both times have been great. The place isn't fancy or anything, the Korean ladies there (there are 3 of them) just cut the way you tell them to. So make sure you know how you want your hair to be cut/what style you want beforehand because they don't really give you any suggestions. Their English is good enough to understand and converse with you. You can be in and out of the salon in 15-20 minutes. Make sure you call in advance to book an appointment because they are always so busy.\n",
      "Excellent place to get your hair done for men, women and children. The staff are very friendly and professional. They offer the latest hair trends but also can make your visit stress free by showing you magazines. Specially helpful is their up to date Korean magazine selection so you can request your K-pop star hair do :P The staff are very skilled and can speak several languages accommodating to their multicultural clientele (at my last appointment, they could speak English, Korean and Japanese) I like this place because it is not pretentious and provides good quality service at great value. But most importantly they don't try to rip you off. The lady seating next to me was asking for several costly procedures but the owner recommended against them saying her hair was too damaged to benefit from the procedure and to consider it for next time! It is in a large plaza so there is plenty of parking. The waiting area is very comfy and they have very industrial looking air purifiers like in hospitals so there is no unpleasant chemical smells. And if you are lucky and get there when they have snacks they share their snacks for free! Two things though: - make an appointment before going. They are very busy and most likely will turn you around if you just drop in - do not accept credit cards\n",
      "Been here for a few years before. My mom still goes here to get a perm & cut, my sister comes to get her hair straightened. Really liked the way how my sisters hair is done so I thought maybe I should give it a try. Called to book an appointment and explained the condition of my hair to the male staff. Knowing that I'm calling a week ahead for that specific day to get my hair done. He says you need to come in for us to see how your hair is on a weekday. I said I need to work on weekdays and the best day is on the weekend. So I've asked for that day and he said \"well, I don't want to book you in and then you not doing it. I don't want to ask a stylist to come in and then calling it off because it takes a third of a time\". VERY UPSET with this kind of service. Pretty much asking my family and friends not to go there anymore.\n",
      "This is my go-to place for a hair cut in Mississauga. Prices are reasonable and competitive with other korean salons in Toronto. Overall really pleased with the last few hair cuts. I don't speak a lick of Korean but the hair stylists that I've had so far can understand, and if they need more detail, one of the workers will help translate no problem. Make an appointment before you go in. I'd probably give it 5 stars if the whole experience 'wow'd' me, but its more of the place that does a good job and leaves it at that, if that makes sense.\n",
      "my favourite place for comfort grilled cheese on homemade flax bread\n",
      "What an amazing little cafe! Really lovely food. Had a quiche and 3 different side salads: carrot/raisin, zucchini with pepper and yellow bell pepper, and celery root. Everything is homemade and delicious. Decor is dinerish feel, but small and clean. My favorite part was the sweet man who ran the place. He was so friendly and said that the food was delicious because it was made with love. Sweet!\n",
      "I really wanted to like this place, because it's a mom-and-pop establishment and the owners seemed friendly. However, we did not have a good experience here. We ordered a grill cheese for the kids with a pasta salad for a side, and then my husband and I ordered a veggie panini and tried the won ton soup. The kids seemed to enjoy their grilled cheese (made with processed cheese - not what I'd anticipated), but my husband and I didn't think the soup was that good. There was also very little filling in our panini, but the food, albeit uninspired, was acceptable. The kicker was that we had ordered two cartons of milk for our kids, one chocolate and one regular. The regular milk (with an expiry date two days in the future) had gone sour, and we unknowingly kept telling our toddler son to drink his milk even though he refused. We just figured he wasn't thirsty, until we brought home the untouched carton home and realized the contents had curdled. Even though it wasn't exactly the owner's fault that the milk had gone bad, based on our overall mediocre dining experience, we probably won't be back...sorry.\n",
      "My wife and I go here quite a bit. Wonderful food and the owner ken is the nicest guy. You can also pick up homemade bread which is wonderful as well.\n",
      "Great place for soups, they usually have 3 available with their won ton a homemade specialty. Sandwiches are made on the spot with their 'made on the premises' bread. They offer a small bowl of a daily salad to go with their lunch specials. Other options are available for a small additional cost. It's a friendly easygoing atmosphere. Lunch should cost you around $10.00 including tax. Expect to see lots of locals, they are there frequently!\n",
      "This cute little cafe is a great place to meet for lunch. They have soups and sandwiches and they even make their own (yummy!) whole grain bread on site. In this day and age I'm surprised that these little cafes survive but I hope that the Den sticks around, it gives the neighbourhood more appeal!\n",
      "Love this place! Awesome service (Mike ROCKS), good beer, and fantastic food, good ambience... all around great place to go. Had the chips (delish!) and tuna sashimi for an app. Highly recommended. The lobster bisque was good as well. I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. Very good experience!!! I will be back ;)\n",
      "Fabulous dining experience! Server was great. Food was top-notch. Will definitely return.\n",
      "I've just visited Lager & Vine for the second time and for the second time I've had a really satisfying meal. The menu is chock full of well-crafted entrees, with no pretention. The food is as good as it sounds. I loved the burger as well as the Voodoo Chicken tacos I tried last night. And don't get me started on the tots! Okay, I'm started.... they're not Ore'Ida, that's for sure! Huge, crispy, soft, delicious tater tots! I also had a really great wedge salad. Nice size. I enjoy the wine and beer list, too, there's always something new to try. My only con is that some of the dishes aren't priced appropriately. My friend ordered a caprese salad for $7 and we both thought the portion was chincy. She was finished with it before I even finished cutting up my wedge. The service is wonderful- friendly and breezy. Update 8.14.15: OMG try the Flatbread Blanco. It's a salty, cheesy heaven. So delicious.\n",
      "Lobster bisque was outstanding! It was a little dark inside, but nice atmosphere. Our waitress was very nice. The mussels were cooled to perfection. The craft beer left a lot to be desired! Very short list of them and most not very good. I would have thought with Lager as the first part off the name they would have had a better selection.\n",
      "Food was pretty good. Had the simple chicken and it was juicy and the pepper bacon confit was good. My wife had the bbq chicken flatbread and it was tasty. But by far the best thing about the restaurant was our server, Michael, who was infectiously joyful and funny.\n",
      "Carol and I had burgers - bacon burger and bleu burger. Carol had fries and thought they were very good. Nice and hot too. I had the tater tots and they are to die for. Both burgers were very good and cooked as ordered. Both were \"knife and fork\" style burgers, unless wearing a bib. French onion soup was very tasty and served nice and hot. It seemed a bit skimpy on cheese and onions though. Otherwise our review would be 5 stars.\n",
      "Sadly disappointed. Was really hoping to find a new spot in Medina. I hear that the quality of food is different than the Hudson location. I've ordered flatbread there 2x (gave it a second chance) but came up disappointed again. Does have s great little bar to stop by and grab a glass of wine\n",
      "We had a party of 6 with a reservation. I was a few minutes early and the first to arrive and was seated at out table in the back room. It was at leat 5 minutes before i was approached and the waiter wanted to know how many people and when I thought they would arrive, which was a strange question. He then started to walk away with out asking if I wanted anything while I was waiting. I stopped him and asked if he could turn up the heat as I was freezing and had to put my coat back on. There was no one else seated at the time in that room. He instead asked if I wanted coffee or tea to help me warm up which I thought was nice until I got my bill and realized he charged me $2.50 for one cup of tea which he never refreshed with warm water for the rest of the evening. He also did not turn up the heat which did not surprise me as he shrugged his shoulders when I asked as if he thought I was nuts. The rest of the evening the service didn't get any better. He was nice enough, but did not come back and check on us. He forgot several things we ordered and we had to hunt him down and then he carged us the regular price for the taco special and we had to hunt him down again to fix our bills. The food was ok. The lobster bisque was good, but not over the top good. It could have used more sheery and seasoning. The taco's were all pretty good, the homemade tater tots very good. The flat bread pizza's were dry and felt like they were thrown together in a hurry. The pretzels were good and piping hot, but we had to hunt our server down again to get plates to share. When I got home and looked at my left overs of the flatbread pizza, it looked as if he had picked up the plate and dumped it in the box, some slices were upside down, some were sideways and all of the toppings were off the pizza and all over. I will give this place one more try to see if this was a fluke. We felt the food was overpriced for what we recieved and the service, even though he was nice, was terrible. I hope they fix the problems or they won't last long.\n",
      "My boyfriend checked this place out when he knew we were going to visit family and we knew we had to come here for a dinner. My last evening while on holiday, we took my family out for dinner here. We reserved the day before with no problems. The day of, they called us back and asked us if we were fine in a booth that normally fits 4 for our group of 5 due to a wedding party reservation. Turns out this was just fine and we were well taken care of. Located right on the beautiful Medina Square, Lager & Vine is a wonderful and classy restaurant and is impeccably decorated. Service is also quite good--I tend to get annoyed in the US when their service provides too much attention (I know, something silly to even complain about) but I found that here they made a good balance of paying enough attention to get you drinks, take your order, etc. but also didn't hover too much. The food and drink was out of this world! There a numerous delicious wines and beers available. I stuck to beer that night and was delighted with all the different local beers avaialble. Both my boyfriend and I tried the sampler of beers (4 or 5 different kinds) and clearly had our favorites (among those IPAs). For food, we had the pretzels and Lager & Vine House Chips. Everyone loved the Chips (I had one with no meat and it was great!) and the pretzels with the cheese and mustard sauces were to die for! For the main course, I had the Tiquila Chipotle Shrimp Tacos and loved these! Although it didn't include much, it was delicious...also make sure to get the homemade tator tots--I'm normally not such a huge fan but they hit the spot. Everyone else was just as pleased with their dinners as I was. Unfortunately, we were all so stuffed that none of us could fit dessert in (I guess there's not always room for dessert?). Will definitely go back again to try some of their other items--they have plenty of fish and vegetarian options for me!\n",
      "I'm sad to write this because I really did love this place, but since my last review (8 months ago) I have been there another 4 or 5 times and every time it's a little worse. The food is nothing to write home about, as well as the service. I just found out that they have had 3 chefs since it's opened and you can tell. Something is always different... and not in a good way. For the price they charge I would expect more than mediocre... which is the best word to describe my last few visits. I still think it's a cool place and the red Sangria is awesome, but I think I will stick to drinks and maybe an app if/when I do come again.\n",
      "Had a nice dinner here a week ago. All the food was awesome (chips and cheese, bacon burger, chorizo Mac n cheese, flatbread pizza and sirloin tip pasta). Good draft selection. We weren't crazy about our first drafts and waiter even offered to refund and replace them, although it wasn't that bad (it's all relative). Nice ambiance and deceptively large seating area. We're fans and I'll definitely be back. A nice addition to the Medina Square.\n",
      "Could have been great, but bad service to first time customer is a deal breaker. Came early evening with very limited customers competing for blonde bartender's attention. Unfortunately, she was more concerned about talking with friends at another table about her recent hair color change. We received sporadic service and I actually was semi-understanding until after waiting patiently to get her attention she refused to give me the happy special on wine because it was 6:02. I really was shocked given that I would have had plenty of time to get the order in if she actually was paying proper attention to us. The food was okay and the wine was not bad, but her total disregard for treating customer's well turned me off and I won't be back.\n",
      "Food atmosphere and service first rate. Full menu,not bar food at all. What a pleasant surprise in Medina. Get the homemade tater tots - there out of this world.\n",
      "Very overpriced and I would not recommend dining here. It wasn't a completely horrible experience though... The server's beer recommendations were spot on, the stuffed peppers (though cold) were really flavorful and the highlight of the meal. The rest was well below average despite being priced quite high. The majority of us chose to go with a few small plates a piece, and even though there were a couple of the same dishes...no 2 looked the same ( different portion sizes, one plate of scallops was seared on both sides the other on just one, different meat temps., etc.). In general I can safely say the whole meal was poorly prepared by people who were very inexperienced. The one constant was everything was cold and had been sitting for a good bit. Like I said before, the majority of the dinner was disappointing...but one thing stood out as offensively horrible...the crab cake. Hands down the worst crab cake I've ever had in my life. Bone dry, completely flavorless, and on top of a bed of rubbery frozen corn. If you make the mistake of dining here....save yourself $16 and avoid this disgusting plate...stick with the other overpriced dishes. At least then you'll be just disappointed and not angry.\n",
      "First, I love places that do small plates. It's so hard to finish portions at a restaurant now. The beer and wine selection here fits with the name. Don't worry, they have fun drinks here as well! I had the sangria which was pretty good but had a little too much orange juice in it. Still delightful though. I had the lunch combo with the lobster bisque and the grilled cheese. The bisque was quite good. Very creamy with a hearty helping of seafoody goodness. The grilled cheese on the other hand was pretty boring. Just some bread and kraft singles like I would have made at home for my niece and nephew. I was hoping for a little more pizazz...maybe bacon or fancy cheese? Dipping the sandwich into the soup saved the day though. Overall I loved the vibe and most of my order. I would definitely try this place out again!\n",
      "Stopped in for my wife's birthday lunch at noon on Friday. We were the only ones there but a few others came while we were there. As an IPA fan, I loved the draft beer list! Wife had a berry lemonade which she raved about. Now for the food porn... To say the Bacon burger was decadent is an understatement! Great flavor, juicy, cooked just right! Gives b spot a run for its money in terms of top flight burgers in town. We'll likely be back to try out dinner menu soon. Only complaint was the bathrooms. Downstairs, dingy, kind of gross to be honest. Only hesitation to go back would be the direct violation of Anthony Bourdain's rule on clean bathrooms.\n",
      "Went here the other day. Excellent beer choices. Service was good, server was very knowledgable and helpful. Good portions. The bruschetta was fantastic! I got the filet mignon and was cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back again. Also happy hour prices are a plus.\n",
      "Good food. Okay device. Recommend the grilled cheese. Salmon salad with artichokes was flavorful. Irish crme cheesecake was outstanding.\n",
      "The pluses: * The only place I know of in Medina to have valet (I could be wrong but I haven't seen it anywhere else since Thyme moved). * One of the few places in Medina that takes reservations. * The Caprese Salad was really good, and that's saying a lot for tomatoes in winter in Ohio. * Some unique options on draft. Not often you find Victory Golden Monkey on tap around here. * Entrees were yummy - I had a burger (it was huge!) and my fiancee had a seafood pasta. We both enjoyed the meal. * Not overly pretentious. Lots of differently dressed people, atmosphere is nice (think: rustic), without being stuffy. * Servers (bartenders and our dinner server) were friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made some solid recommendations. The minuses: * If you DON'T have reservations, expect a long wait, especially since people are coming in droves to try it out. TIP: Seating in the immediate bar area (all the hi-top tables) is first-come, first served. * If you don't valet, it may be a challenge to find a parking spot. * Prices are not bad, but higher than others in this city. Remember, the first location is in Hudson, and everything is priced higher there. :) * If you're out for a family dinner with kids, not sure this is the place, unless it's maybe a weeknight dinner. Overall - I enjoyed it. I have a goal to avoid \"big chain\" locations this year at all costs, so I can see this being a regular addition to our restaurant location. I'm not going for 5 stars since the reservation/parking issue kind of irks me (essentially, if you don't have a reservation, they make one for you at a later time).\n",
      "Great beer selection, awesome wines... Best bet is to ask or hope for Andrew as your server! Be sure to ask for specials, and take your server's advice!\n",
      "Lots of options for large, medium, or small meals, plates to share and plates to keep to yourself. Nothing groundbreaking in my personal opinion, but it has a wonderful cozy atmosphere.\n",
      "My husband and I have been to this restaurant 3 times. Each time the service was bad and the drinks weren't mixed right. The last time was the most disappointing. The servers were more interested in flirting with eachother and drinking than in taking care of customers. I ordered a tomato saled and the tomatoes were mealy. The manager took it off our bill but didn't stop to apologize (the place wasn't busy). So sad because I was really excited about a new restaurant on the square.\n",
      "This place has good atmosphere. Right on the square. Stopped in for 'lunch'. The place was pretty dead, but it was 2pm. I figure on any given weekend evening it may really shine. Most of the servers were just standing around near the bar. We sat right across from the kitchen, so that kept us occupied. The restaurant was overall very quiet and the kitchen had a good selection of music going. I usually like to take it easy and hang out a while between apps and entree, ect. but it was 2pm; we were hungry! Food took for-ev-er considering. Was worth the wait. Everything was delicious!! Some of the best fries I have ever had. My bacon burger was cooked perfectly. Great upscale style pub fare.\n",
      "First time dining at this establishment. Was much larger than I thought it would be. My husband and I went without our children and I probably wouldn't take them here- seems to be a more upscale, quiet place to dine. Food was really fantastic. My husband had the scallop dish and I had the hanger steak dish. My steak was cooked perfectly and we were both very happy with our dishes. The only thing that I found (slightly) bothersome was that the lighting was a little too dark. Very nice place, would definitely come here again.\n",
      "We attended on a Friday night, and it was quite busy. That said, our waitress was pretty chilly and inattentive. The food is American fare: much of which you can find in other local restaurants, done better. When a restaurant states they are a gastropub, I would expect to see more exotic proteins than chicken, beef and lobster - especially at the prices they wanted. Generally, the experience was fine, but I probably won't take guests there, or go back myself.\n",
      "Went for lunch and we ordered the flatbreads which were large enough to split one. I loved the presentation but most importantly the taste was excellent for flat bread. Missing a star for service, but it was the lunch hour. Will definitely be back to continue to explore the menu.\n",
      "It was just \"ok\". I paid $15 for a small salad so I think it's a bit overpriced. Wasn't impressed. Won't be back.\n",
      "The first time we visited it was alright the salmon with some of the best I've had. Second time around wasn't so great. The already small portions seem to get smaller and service was something to be desired. Lost reservations and slow service for drinks and refills was something to be addressed. Overall the food is good but you don't get much for what you pay for.\n",
      "This review is for our most recent visit on 12/22. We have eaten here a couple times before and always enjoyed the food and service. This past visit will be our last. Based on past experience I suggested Lager & Vine to my family. All 12 were seated by 5:45 and the place was at most 50% full. We ordered 3 appetizers and 2 salads between 12 people. At 7:00 our dinners were served. 45 minutes after placing our dinner order. 3 of the first 4 dishes served were barely luke warm to cool. Poor food on top of a long wait only compounds the problem. Went face to face with owner who insisted it was 25 minutes from order in to order out but he could not explain the multiple cool dishes - which wouldn't have happened if the food had actually been turned around in 25 minutes. He never did apologize to my party for the wait or poor food. Arrogant owners who can't believe they did any wrong are the restaurants worst ambassador. He may think his s**t doesn't stink, but on this night his food did.\n",
      "The chicken tacos (supposed to be spicy but weren't very) were really good. The appetizer, chips with gorgonzola and bacon, was good but too rich and salty by far. We ate about half and had to send it away. The bartenders were nice. I would definitely make a return trip.\n",
      "We went to Lager and Vine as a family for a Saturday lunch. We all ordered different things from the menu and they were all very good. Service was excellent also. We will be back!\n",
      "Good food cool atmosphere. Priced a little high for the amount of food you get but still great flavors. Feels like a classic pub yet fancy. Service was good and drink choices on tap were local it was very cool.\n",
      "Dinner for two took 1 hour and 45 minutes on Saturday at 5. Inexperienced wait staff, filet that's mostly grizzle, butchered ahi tuna and missing sides. Great location but no parking. Will wait a year to try it again having had two weak experiences since the opening date!\n",
      "Second & last time at this establishment. There were four of us , the drinks order were taken & presented in a timely fashion. The salads & soup took 20 minutes to arrive , excuse me but 20 minutes for a bowl of soup & basically a green salad . From that point another 20 minutes for tacos. The place is overpriced for the quality of food served , if you get it in a timely manner while it is still warm.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite dinner spots! We usually save it for a semi special occasion because it can get expensive. Everything I've had here I really liked and I'm a picky eater! House chips for an app are yummy, seafood pasta is great too. I really love this place, great staff and great food and it's kind of a dark sexy place for a romantic dinner. Try it out!!!!\n",
      "I stumbled on this place by accident. This place is awesome!! I will be back!! I had the burger with an IPA and both were great. I ordered the burger medium and it came out med-well but tasted great non the less. The meal came with tater tots that were huge! Beer list is great. The decor is very hipster with the barn wood walls Try it out if you're in medina\n",
      "Great food, the beef tip pasta is my favorite. Great wine and craft beer selection. The homemade tater tots are awesome.\n",
      "Came to medina from Los Angeles to visit friends and went here for lunch. Very impressive and Andrew did a great job. Great lobster bisque and my burger with egg on top was super..\n",
      "Excellent food and service! Yum! Great to see non-bar/fried food in Medina. We will be back!\n",
      "My wife and I enjoyed an excellent experience here last evening. Our server was prompt and spot on with her recommendations. The hand cut chips and cheese were very tasty, and served hot. I had the chorizo Mac and cheese, she had a flatbread. Both were hot from the kitchen. We enjoyed the atmosphere, and we will return to try other menu options. I felt the cost was reasonable.\n",
      "Not impressed. The interior is dated, the food is amateur-ish and overpriced. Not much flavor. Service was good though. Will not be back.\n",
      "I went here for lunch with a group today after having dinner last week. I have also been to their Hudson location for dinner a few months ago, so I was familiar with the menu and food concept. They have taken a former restaurant space that had been dormant for at least three years and did a very good remodeling job, taking out some of the booths, installing some nice rough wood wall treatments and very pleasing and attractive lighting. The food concept is \"small plates\", and I'll admit that I've never been a fan, as the portion sizes shrink quite a bit and the prices don't. They suffer from the same problem, although the lunch selections are not overly small and they do offer a nice \"combo\" value for soup and salad or sandwich. The \"Lager\" refers to the good selection of beers that they have on tap, and they are one of the few places that I have found the very tasty \"Crispin\" hard cider. They also have quite a few wines on tap and their selection is good although a bit on the higher priced side. Now the good: excellent lobster bisque, caesar salad, and stuffed pepper appetizer (only available at dinner). Very good \"small plates\" at dinner: crab cake, Maine clams, and sliced filet. Not so good: service was slow and they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Understandable if this was really a \"new' operation, but their Hudson menu and management experience could have (should have) made them better prepared. Orders were slow to be taken and water refills were pretty much nonexistent. I had the burger, cooked \"medium\" and it came out well done and also without any of the condiments I had requested. All in all, I will be back, as Medina needs more options downtown, and there is a lot of promise here. Nice article in the Gazette today, and the owner was quoted as saying he would love to have people have a drink at Thyme2, have dinner at L&V and then have an after dinner beer at Sully's. Hmmm, good idea!!\n",
      "Oh boy, Greek food! This place doesn't really authentic Greek food and would easily be clumped into the Turkish/Middle Eastern/Greek fast food places. But hey, I don't mind. Their menu is standard: your choice of meat (gyro), splash of hummus, some Greek fries (topped with feta - Greeks don't do this btw but who cares), some middle eastern salads, and you're set! The portions are huge and you'll be satisfied every time. Meat is flavorful (garlic spices) and everything that's topped with feta is good in my book. Beware of the \"Greek breath\" though. You'll stink of garlic all day. And your office will love you for it. --- Distinguishing factor: QGF - Quick garlic food Hummus Score: 7/10 - Not bad, but I've had much better. Nothing remarkable.\n",
      "Decided to give this place a shot as I leave near by and see it all the time. The employees who were working were helpful and genuinely nice. The service was quick, and you get to stand and watch them cook your order as you wait, which is both amusing and comforting to see for a 'fast food' type environment. In all, the price was fair and the taste was delicious; comparable or better than any other quick-service Greek places I've tried. If you're in the mood for some quick takeout and want something a little outside the normal cuisine options, don't shy away from this place. Give it a shot.\n",
      "I'm going to keep this brief... Taste of Greek is fantastic. The french fries are some of the best I've ever had. I'm not even a fan of thicker fries normally, but these were crazy good. Hot and crispy. I had a gyro as well - the meat was cut right in front of me and was cut into really thin strips - almost like a Philly Cheesesteak. I'm a fan of this style. Their tzatziki sauce is delicious and fresh. The pita was also fresh and soft... the entire thing was the size of my head and while I managed to scarf it all down, I was too full to finish every french fry (but not for a lack of trying). This place is really clean, and everything is cooked and prepared out in the open. It's fast-casual style, but they weren't super busy when I went and they were bringing food out to the tables which was nice. Most of the tables could only seat two people which makes this perfect for a quick lunch with a co-worker or by yourself. They have a few tables that seat more, but it's not a huge restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpful. This is a family owned Valley business - they are apparently related to a few other places around town (not all the same name, but the ones I've eaten at were also very good). The only thing this place is missing is delivery. If these restaurants would deliver, they would be unstoppable. Oh, and there needs to be one really close to my house. I'm definitely going to be back.\n",
      "I had been scoping this place out for months before I tried it. I always see it when I go to Sprouts but I'm always over there before they open. When I finally made my way over there in the afternoon I got a gyro and fries. I took it home had maybe 3-4 bites and fed the rest to my dog. It was so greasy that I had oil dripping down my face. It was flavorless which I thought was impossible for gyro meat. The tzatziki was flavorless as well and really watered down. The fries were OK. I've eaten a lot of gyro's in my life and this one was not good. The gyro place on Northsight is only about 5 minutes away from here and 100 times better.\n",
      "Good prices. Great food. Can't go wrong if you like Greek.\n",
      "I went in today and asked the owner if he could not cut the meat so thin and cut it a little thick and he said No, this is how I cut it. I respect that but I will not be returning, he also missed out on a large 237 people catering event for my office.\n",
      "Website indicates they are open on Sundays. Yet when I went out of my way to try this place on a Sunday - guess what? Yep, closed. And there were other people who showed up to eat as well while I loitered outside, trying to find an alternative place for falafel on a Sunday. To make matters worse I have politely notified them of this on a subsequent visit and clearly expressed how inconvenient it was. And here I am now, writing this review weeks later... and the website has not changed. Fail.\n",
      "Their chicken pita is as good as their gyros! Lean, tender chicken, well seasoned, cooked just right! Huge portion.\n",
      "Great spot in local neighborhood for Mediterranean food. Very fresh everything is homemade and at a very reasonable price. The Gyros are fantastic!\n",
      "I'm always looking for a great casual bite near Scottsdale Healthcare on Shea. Lo and behold, I found Taste of Greek as I was waiting in the endless drive-thru lane at Starbucks. Greek . . . one of my favorite cuisines . . . could they possibly have Babaganoosh? And if so, will it be any good? Today, on my way back from a doctor's appointment, I stopped in and there was my beloved Baba on the menu. I ordered some to go. Ahh, it is so delicious . . . very smooth and smoky. I wonder if they make it themselves? Who cares? It's delicious. Can't wait to try the gyros. Everyone seated had one and they looked very satisfying :) The counterperson was very sweet and enthusiastic. The gentlemen cooking were very focused on what they were doing. They barely looked up until one of them called my number for pick up. He, too, was very personable and thanked my for my business. The restaurant itself is small, great for take-out. Drinks are self-serve. Taste of Greek will definitely be part of my regular rotation!\n",
      "They have a high quality gyro sandwich with a great deal for price...$6.75, inlcuding fries and a drink. Pita is always fresh. Tzatziki sauce is really a sauce, not just sour cream. Hot fries are great...and I am not a fries fan. The guy at the counter taking orders is super gracious on the customer service front. I hope they thrive in this neighborhood. We are short of good, reasonably priced restaurants with quality food.\n",
      "Got lots of recommendations here and did disappoint! Souvlaki and tabbolUlah were fantastic for a small unassuming place. Clean, nice, friendly and good!!!\n",
      "HUGE servings and AMAZING FRIES... One order of the gyro combo is enough for my husband and me to split for dinner. We love this place (it's a 3 min drive from our place).\n",
      "Souvlaki plate is amazing!! That's all I was going to say, it said it all. Just in case you want more... The Falafel Pita, Chicken Pita and Dolmas are all all great! :-)\n",
      "The food here is very good and fresh. Ambiance is not great but is on par with most Greek restaurants in this price range. I would have given 4 stars, except their website says they are open on Sunday and they definitely are not. I have been by twice to check. Now I see another yelp review that says this was pointed out to the restaurant last fall. This is really inconsiderate to the customers. Seriously, how hard can it be to change the hours on the website?\n",
      "We love this place. Great food, always fresh!!!! Same cook every time so the food is consistently fabulous!! For the meat eater: go with the chicken pita. For the veggie lover: go with the Greek salad and the fresh steamed Veggies. Mmm mmm tasty.\n",
      "Friendly staff. Make sure you order the gyro plate and souvlaki plate. Yum!\n",
      "Love this place!! Opa!! The food is fresh, staff is always courteous and friendly! Try the Gyros sandwich! Yum!\n",
      "Taste of Greek is one of our all time favorite Greek place in the valley. The pita bread is delicious, the chicken pita sandwiches are delicious (we always add feta to them) and the service is great. Their homemade hummus is wonderful, too! We always do take-out as we live so close....\n",
      "An honest review of the food: it's pretty bad. I had a gyro and it was good/ok. Too much meat, could use a little more sauce, but overall it was not bad. I'm just getting to the bad part. My wife ordered the tabouli salad. She had to spit it out. It was 90% parsley, and it was very, very bitter. Inedibly bad. Took it back to the counter and the man, who was *very* nice and accommodating, agreed to refund our money or give her something else. So the man brought us samples of hummus and baba ganoush. The hummus tasted like a dirty dish rag, and I'm not trying to be funny. My guess is that they cleaned the bowl they made it in with dirty rags and thus imparted a mildew taste and smell. The texture was not like any hummus I have ever had before, more like mayonnaise with no tahini or lemon taste at all. Just awful. The baba ganoush was no better than the hummus. We believe it was simply hummus mixed with a little boiled eggplant. It also has the same dirty dish rag taste and smell as the hummus. Just plain bad. As for atmosphere, well there isn't one. Semi-clean, semi-dirty, dark, with no decorations except for some gyro posters. I'm not trying to be mean, but it's akin to something you would find in Glendale, not Scottsdale. Why one star? Well the man that helped us was very pleasant and refunded our money, plus the gyro was not bad.\n",
      "01/05/13 2.5 stars. Came here on a Persian coworker's suggestion I try it. I was informed by the nice young man that Taste of Greek was out of the steak pita that my coworker told me to check out. (Since I try to avoid chicken and lamb due to food allergies, steak and chick peas are the only proteins I'd be considering, anyway.) Since steak was not an option tonight, I went for a la carte items of chicken pita ($7.95), regular hummus ($4.50 or $4.95), and a couple of falafel balls ($1 for two pieces). Surprisingly, it took longer than I expected to prepare the falafel balls and pita wrap, which I took as a good sign that they were cooked-to-order. The hummus was the only one that was pre-prepared, and it came with ONE olive. A rather tasty olive at that, and it was a pity that it was all by its lonesome, since the bite that included it was the only time I thought the hummus was worthwhile... Still, I've kept the container in the fridge, as it still is a protein source. (However, now that I think about it, if it's not organic, then really, I'm not doing my body any favors- SAY NO TO GMO!) The falafel balls were piping-hot and tasty, albeit a tad too salty. Again, I'm going to assume the chick peas weren't organic and the soybean oil used to fry it wasn't either, so this may be the last time I ever speak of them... The first few bites of the pita wrap didn't win me over UNTIL I remembered to add the tzatziki sauce I'd requested to be on the side (cuke allergy). After I'd slathered on the homemade sauce, it was very good! Worthy of a few allergy symptoms, even. I'll be coming back to give the steak wrap a try, but I doubt I'll be back for the other items, unless ToG goes organic. If you know of any organic mediterranean restaurants, please let me know! :)\n",
      "Good place to grab lunch. They use fresh ingredients and the serving size/price is reasonable. - Greek Salad: Pretty good. There were lots of fresh veggie toppings and a ton of feta. I prefer more lettuce on my salads, but that's my only complaint. The tahini sauce it came with tasted a little spoiled, thankfully it was on the side. For only 50 cents more I got a huge soft pita on the side. - Falafal: Really good. Most restaurant's falafal balls are dry and plain tasting, so I was very pleasantly surprised that these were moist, fresh, and quite flavorful. Highly recommend! - French Fries: Mmm their fries are great. Big, crispy, and soft in the middle. - Gyro: I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend really likes the gyros. They look very sizable, and the tzatziki sauce is very good.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Should have been 5 stars, but let me explain: On a girls-only trip, a friend of mine and I visited Scottsdale, AZ over Labor Day weekend and decided to try this place out. My friend and I split the Fattoush (Mediterranian) Salad and thought we'd died and gone to Heaven! There was so much of it, we were able to save 1/2 of it for the next day's lunch. My only complaint is that on Sunday, we wanted to go back and get another couple of salads (YES, IT WAS THAT GOOD!) for dinner. We knew that it would be closed on Monday, so we Googled the website to find out what the hours were on Sunday (they close at 6pm) and we actually left the swimming pool early so that we could be at the restaurant by 5:15 pm (in case they wanted to close a little early since the next day was a holiday). Guess what? They were CLOSED! The sign on the door said that they were closed on Monday, 9/3 - nothing about closing early on Sunday, and I even checked the hours of operation sign to the right of the door to make sure their closing hour was 6pm on Sunday. They didn't just miss out on me and my friend, we watched 2 other cars with people walk up to the door and do the same thing we did (pull on door, read sign, look at hours of operation sign to the right of door, look at watch, lean into glass with hands cupped around eyes to see if someone was hiding inside, pull door handle one more time, shake heads and walk back to car.) SO DISAPPOINTED! Had they been open at 5:15pm on Sunday, I would have given them 5 stars. Hopefully they'll still be there next year when we go back to Scottsdale! I'm buying a week's worth of food, in case they decide to close early without notice again!\n",
      "We went here a few weeks ago, and I was definitly impressed! This local guy sure does know his food! GREAT FLAVOR, huge portions, reasonably priced. One small nit-the onion slices are huge, and I wasn't a big fan of that. But I recommend you try him out.\n",
      "What a nice place! The food is amazing and the people are so very friendly. The menu offers a very wide variety of the usual middle eastern flare. They even offer vegan dishes! I highly recommend the grilled veggies with hummus. The prices are VERY reasonable and the portion sizes are quite large. I am a large eater and I have never walked away hungry. Therefore, without hesitation I can say this is a great place to eat!\n",
      "Love hummus, falafel, gyros and the like? Come here! You can taste the freshness. Pita Jungle is good, but this is much, much better. Come here to get your Greek food fix, especially if you live/work nearby in Scottsdale Ranch or by the hospital. Despite being hidden in strip mall by Quizno's, Starbucks and Chipotle, it is a real gem. Good service too. Support small business in Scottsdale.\n",
      "The chicken here is better quality than most. It seems to be marinated in something yellow, but was fresh and reheated on the grill before entering my open pita for the Chicken Pita. Good dose of Tzaztki sauce and I added 50 cents for feta cheese (which should be included). Otherwise, it had all the regular stuff, but this chicken made the difference in sandwich star quality. Only issue is that the sole lunch special is for the GYRO which is normally $5.95. My pita only costs $6.25, but owner gives you drink and fries for about a buck, instead of 3 bucks. Not sure why chicken and any pita cannot be on special for lunch. This is a bit infuriating.l Respect the chicken!\n",
      "Taste of Greek is exceptional! We come here at least twice a week because we like the food so much. I usually order chicken gyro and sometimes pita with hummus. I highly recommend this place. The owner is very nice and I believe his son works the register, he is also very nice and outgoing. I work next to another gyro place, but after work I make the drive to this one instead.\n",
      "I had a craving for Gyros and I found a store that serves the food as a main dish and not something hidden in the menu. Store is nice and clean, every time I go here, the staff is friendly and we have carried a few conversations. Food is always excellent, never had a complaint. The food is a bit pricey though considering that other Greek restaurants in the neighboring towns will offer $6 for the same meal. Usually my bill goes very close to $10 - $11. Other than that, it is a solid place to get some Greek food.\n",
      "Place is under new ownership, Gyro Express. Am sad to see the old owner go, he was really nice and I wish him the best!\n",
      "Love it. Huge servings for a cheap price. Friendly staff, good food, and doesn't take forever to prepare. Will recomend to others!\n",
      "I was a little skeptical at first to try this place out considering tg e first time we went there the power was out so they were closed. The next time I came was during the lunch rush, and they had it pretty under control. The only thing I didn't like, was the way the tables were set up. Not very much room for a party greater than two. And also, the table was sticky. The food was tasty. I ordered the gyro special, and it was very fresh & tasteful. It was very hot though (not complaining!!) so I had to wait about 10 min to eat it. Definitely would recommend and go again.\n",
      "My girlfriend just had her nails done in the same center. We walked by and ordered a few Gyros to-go. Got home and we both took our first bites and looked at eachother with the same thought. These were awful. Now I know why they were not busy at all.\n",
      "Ehhh I'm a hummus snob and I'm still determined to find a hummus spot. They put too much garlic in their hummus and the falafels are just okay.\n",
      "If I were judging visual appeal and ambiance I'd be hard pressed to award Taste of Greek even a single star. Thankfully I'm not, and the delicious food and speedy service here earn a solid four stars. The ingredients are fresh and the food is served hot. The fries are always perfectly crispy without being burnt. The gyro meat is a bit greasy, but it is freaking delicious! The servings sizes are generous, and the gyro special is a killer deal. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Give Taste of Greek a chance to earn your business; you'll be glad you did!\n",
      "Ordered the \"grilled veggies \" plate to be helathy...an give them a chance over pita jungles version . These were frozen then thawed overcooked greasy soggy veggies. Not ever going back.\n",
      "The food was very flavorful but I don't recommend getting it to-go. I live about 5 minutes away and by the time I got home the pita bread was completely soggy and I couldn't enjoy half of the fries for the same reason. The parts I did get to eat were very delicious though. The staff was very friendly as well. It was kind of pricey but that's looking like the norm for all the Greek places I've been to. I probably won't go back only because I've had better at either My Big Fat Greek Restaurant or The Greek Pita in the Tempe Market Place food court. Still if you live close by and are craving some greek it's a good place to go.\n",
      "Come here on girls night out. You will not be dissapointed. Hunky dark Italian servers aside, the food is excellent. I think this might be some of the best italian food in the Valley.\n",
      "Service was just ok, food was good but a little too pricey. They were really slow to get us food and check. Would not go back.\n",
      "Favorite Italian place in Scottsdale! Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Phoenix for the first time. This service is great. They accommodated 15 of my family members and we had the best time!\n"

      "The food here is consistently good, but let's face it ladies...if you've lived near downtown Scottsdale for a while, you've heard about the hot waitstaff. They even had their own calendar for a couple years! Sadly, on a recent birthday outing with 4 other girls, we were disappointed to find that the hot young boys were nowhere in sight (no offense to the fine waiters that do work there). That's the real reason we chose Brioni's, as there are other places to get good Italian food if that's what you're after. Granted, it may be that the boys had the night off for their other job with the Chippendales, but I doubt it. We were there on a Friday night, and they seated us in a room I didn't know existed (the place is huge, with several rooms), not in the bar area where I'd had good times in the past. The service was good, although the corner where we were seated smelled like old wood...? It seems the crowd here has aged a bit as well..not that there's anything wrong with that...but it was more of the close to retirement set, rather than hot middle-agers like us! Bottom line: still great food, good place to take visiting family around the holidays, but unfortunately the man candy is gone...\n",
      "So, I was introduced to Pasta Brioni about two years ago by one of my best friends and her sister. We trying to decide where to eat, and they we're like \"Let's go to Pasta Brioni because the servers are sooooo hot!\" So we went, and yes the server was very good looking. The girls were pleased. Aside from the staff, the food has been good every time I have been there. I always get the four cheese rigatoni, and it is very good. If you go...get the crab cakes as a starter. Go for the food, the \"soooo hot\" staff that I have heard about has been hit or miss.\n",
      "Freaking Outstanding. Great food. Fair pricing. Super atmosphere for old school Italian.\n",
      "I went on a Sunday night before a movie. I had read the reviews about being welcomed right away and sure enough, the wait staff was on top of it. Super friendly and welcoming. My waiter was flippin' fantastic. I'm not sure if he was the owner or manager or something, he was dressed differently than the other wait staff. He gave some fantastic recommendations, he was funny, just an all out pleasure. The food was also fantastic. I read one review that complained about the sweet butter that they serve with the bread: I admit, I was first taken aback by it but learned to love it. All in all, great food, great service, fantastic ambiance. Perfect. And I almost forgot one more thing! One of the people I went with is gluten-free (I know, **groan** haha just kidding), and our server brought out a piece of gluten free, flourless chocolate cake on the house. We didn't even ask for anything for dessert. It was a very welcome surprise, and the cake was damn good.\n",
      "The food was excellent! HOWEVER...the Service was nonexistant! We arrived at 6:40PM 1/19/2013, we were told they didn't have our reservation for 6. They were able to seat us within 5 minutes on the heated patio. We were handed menus and then the Waiter dissappeared. Later on another waiter came and introduced himself as Mike and he would be taking good care of us. He took our drink order and we never saw him again. Later on the original Waiter came and said he'd help us out. He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted bread. They gave us all a warm roll and dissappeared again. We had no butter or dipping oil for the bread. One os our friends got up and fetched oild and vinegar from the waiter station. Later on the original waiter came back to take our order. When I said that I believe we were abandoned, he said that they were busier than usual and that I hurt his feelings. He took another drink order but didn't return with them. Another 3rd waiter came back with our drinks about 20 minutes later. Our food was great but then it took another 30 minutes to get our bill. It took them 2 hours and 20 minutes to serve us from start to finish. The whole time, I watched to see how busy they really were and the poor service was due to disorganization. Not one women works there and I think that's a big part of their problem. Women would have been organized and efficient. These guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed. I don't think it had to do with being busy (there were empty tables the whole time), just laziness and/or an inability to be organized and efficient. We won't go back again.\n",
      "I came to Pasta Brioni during a work trip to Arizona. It is a conveniently located restaurant not to far from the airport with a ton of parking. They offer a wide range of Italian fares from pasta, pizza, seafood, and more. They also have a large wine list as well. The decor reminds me of the old school NYC Italian restaurant. The dim lighting sets the right mood for drinks and food. For dinner I got the salmon with a glass of white wine. The salmon was very delicious. It was perfectly cooked and marinated. Each bite made me wanting more and more. Overall, great food and fantastic service. I will definitely consider coming back the next time I am in town.\n",
      "This was the 1st year I didnt spend Thanksgiving at my aunts home. Retired, my aunt didnt feel like spending all day cooking. I decided to try Pasta Brioni. It was amazing! The food delicious and our server \"Stony\" was great. Thanks for making our evening such an awesome delight!\n",
      "I really like this little place. :) The food is very good, and I've never had a bad meal here. Salads, calamari, red sauce, pastas, bread, olive oil...all very, very good. Dessert was kinda meh (though I ate it anyway - it's rude to wrap with Italians), but they have a decent wine list, so eat up, and skip dessert. 98% of the all-male staff are exceptionally hot, btw (there might have been women working there, but I didn't notice in the sea of tall, dark and handsome and dressed in black). Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone. I was tempted to write my number on a few bev naps and pass them around to anyone who eye fucked me longer than 10 seconds. I'd recommend not taking a date you're pretty into just for this reason (lesson learned - lol).\n",
      "This is a great place! I've become a regular. Happy hour is amazing, the portions are full size! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favs are fried ravioli, penne vodka, caprese salad, and eggplant dish. Give it a shot especially if you love Italian food!\n",
      "You cannot beat their penne alla vodka with shrimp. Been eating it for YEARS and I've yet to find better. Promise!!!!!\n",
      "I have always loved the food especially the meatballs and pizza but until today I have been reluctant to go more often because the bread is so important to me and theirs had been heavy and too dry for me. Today it was totally different and delicious!!!\n",
      "Wow, wow, wow. Had a large group service was amazing. food is delicious I had always heard great things but those things are true and then some. The Calamari was amazing and fresh. the Pizza was just right, i like to fold my slice! All the appetizers we had were perfect. We did some pre gaming for a bachelor party but the apps were so good we had to get more food. highly recommend.\n",
      "The pizza is excellent and inexpensive. The rest of the food is good as well, but a bit more expensive.\n",
      "A huge group of us (we filled about 8 tables) were visiting Phoenix and our hosts recommended Pasta Brioni. The food and service were amazing, despite the challenges of feeding 75 people all at once. Servers got us our drinks quickly, refilled our water glasses often, and kept those huge yummy rolls coming! We ate family style (ordering 4 big dishes to be shared), and yet the kitchen was able to accommodate a few of us who had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free). The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come! The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery). The meat-eaters at the table were equally ranting and raving about the veal shiitake (in a marsala sauce) and the chicken martini (in a white wine sauce). Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Phoenix!!\n",
      "Had reservations for 6 PM, got there at 5:50 PM and we're seated right away. Table was already. My daughter wasn't feeling well so we ordered soup it took them 45 minutes before they even realized she was never given the soup, I had to ask for it. We didn't get out of there until a quarter after eight we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. A party of eight came in after us and left 25 minutes before us. Not too happy with them. Not like they used to be.\n",
      "I decided to try the penne vodka. Since everybody's comment seemed positive about it. I live 2 min form this restaurant so I got it delivered to my house. Well, how to say it? It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye. Seriously guys.!! Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good. I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here. The only good thing was the can of coke!\n",
      "My Favorite Italian Restaurant tucked away in Old Scottsdale. Vodka Penne with Shrimp and a touch of spice is my fav! Desserts are old school homemade recipes and the cheesecake and tiramisu are the best I've had in Scottsdale!\n",
      "Our meal was ok. Nothing to write home about. How does an italian restaurant run out of Bolognese?\n",
      "I'll start with the positive. Service, ambiance and bread were good. However, if you put pasta in your restaurants name, don't serve it over cooked. Ruins the meal. The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks. If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.\n",
      "I absolutely love this place!!! Service is always great, especially with Mikey the Don. Everything is amazing here. We catered for our employee recognition event and everyone LOVED it. And their cheesecake is to die for.\n",
      "Awesome service...good traditional Italian cuisine....love Pasta Brioni!\n",
      "Unfortunately, the food was less then mediocre at best. We both ordered their cheese ravioli and after the first bite we both determined that it had been cooked in the same water that had had some type of seadfood cooked in it. The taste of shellfish was very evident. Also, their bruschetta was not good at all. I would not recommend the restaurant.\n",
      "Some friends recommended Pasta Brioni, and then we got a coupon, so we decided why not. 2 large pizzas for $16.99, we added 2 toppings, delivered hot in less than 30 minutes. To our surprise the pizza was amazing! Total with delivery $21.69, great deal, very good pizza! Yes, we recommend and we'll be getting delivery again!\n",
      "The Good - The food was very good, which, of course, is most important. The Bad - My biggest disappointments were, number one, all the glasses on the table for 4, both water and wine, were horribly water spotted. I've never seen such a thing in a restaurant. Number two, my husband had a soft drink and asked for a refill. He was charged for 2 soft drinks. Who charges for refills these days?? Very disappointing and petty.\n",
      "I love this place! I order take out a lot. The Caprese salad and beef sandwich are my favorites. I've ordered their pizza before and love it - they are also one of the few places that have kalamata olives! Delivery charge is $1, unlike many of the chain places around that charge quite a bit more. I've always had really great service. If there is something up they've always called me right away and I've yet to meet one of their delivery folks I haven't really liked. Today they did especially well, were especially fast and helped me get my cat back inside :)\n",
      "I like Brioni's. The Happy Hour specials are a steal. The ambiance is usually very good. I like the old school formal wooden decor. The food is anywhere from good to outstanding depending on the item. In general, they follow the Italian tradition of choosing the best ingredients, instead of gimmicky crap. I really like the mussels with the marachiara sauce. That (clear tomato with garlic) sauce is worth a trip. The calamari salad is also a wonderful and healthy choice. Split that with a friend at happy hour followed by a pasta dish and you're eating like a king for nothin'. I've had 4 or 5 pasta dishes that were all great. Today, I had the chicken sorrentino which was very good. However, I did have one bad experience that I'd like to share for the purpose of entertaining Yelpers and perhaps fixing the issue at a restaurant I enjoy eating at. If you're about to eat, you might want to stop reading. - I ordered my food. It was a later in the lunch hour and pretty empty. - I went to the bathroom. - After going, I saw there was NO toilet paper. This is pretty bad for an upscale restaurant, but whatever. Call it an oversight. - So, I called the restaurant from my cell phone and explained that I was in the bathroom in need of toilet paper. - No one ever came. I gave up because I was in a hurry during the work day. - After eating, I checked the bathroom again. Still, no toilet paper. I know this is a weird situation and I've eaten here about six times with no similar issues. I was too bashful to bring it up again in person and there was no feedback link on their web site. So, I'm hoping someone will read this review at the restaurant and fix the issue so that it does not happen again.\n",
      "Pasta was gummy..french bread is heavy.. nor do I say more\n",
      "How you doin? The rumors are true ladies, the servers are all men, all hunky, all the time. If you like 'em tall (or short), dark, handsome and sarcastic, you'll love Pasta Brioni. The servers even have their own calendar. Wait. Is this the male version of Hooters? This is a great place to come with the girls for birthday parties, bachelorette parties or 'just because.' The servers are very attentive- perhaps a little overly- (are lap dances always included with your meal)?? The servers aren't the only good part of this restaurant though. The food is delicious. The pasta's are all great- the ravioli, pasta giardini, lasagne- you can't really go wrong. So grab some girls, order a carafe or two of sangria and enjoy the scenery along with a great meal!\n",
      "I ordered delivery because the hubs was out of town and I wanted comfort food. I got the ravioli and lasagna (which between the two, lasted me 4 meals!) and both were awesome! The delivery was quick as well! They came with small side salads which was nice so that I could be extra lazy and not have to make one for myself :) The pasta was tender but still had a good bite to it and the sauce was my favorite - simple and sweet!\n",
      "ive been working across the place for almost a year now and finally got a chance to sit down and have dinner. one of our customers once ordered us a bunch of pizza from here and i managed to grab a slice before it all ran out, and it remember it being fairly decent. its very dark inside here, which sets a romantic mood. the decor is nice and everything looked well put together. the rolls were good and served with olive oil and parm. ice cold water, and our server was fast to greet us and get us started with a beer and a glass of wine. he showed us the specials for the day on the board, and we went with this chicken dish (forgot the name) to split (which he didnt end up charging us the $3 split plate fee for). the dish arrived in a timely fashion with a side of penne pasta. it was 2 generous-sized chicken breasts stuffed with 3 different kinds of melted cheese served over this absolutely delicious sauce and spinach. i guess it could be similar to the french chicken cordon bleu and it absolutely blew coup des tarte's one (priced at $30, and only 1 breast) out of the water. if you love chicken, pasta, and cheese, you must try this. i just wish i could remember what it was called. we had a pricing problem which was easily adjusted by our server with no hassle. all the servers in there are cute italian boys. the old woman seated at the table next to us drank way to much wine and was haphazardly flirting with our server. can't wait to try more of their pasta, i will definitely be back!\n",
      "UNREMARKABLE is the best rating I can offer. while it has been a few years since I last visited, I had been anticipating a some what better of a dinning experience. It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than \"please follow me\". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning. I followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room, he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred. By the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated. JC\n",
      "We had a delicious dinner with fantastic service at Pasta Brioni last night! It has been in the Valley FOREVER and most often my family gets takeout but I have to say, dining in is a super fab experience. They bring you warm, doughy rolls to start that are absolutely delicious. The best part, they have EVOO + Balsamic on the tables so that you can dip your bread! {my guilty pleasure} We split a bottle of delicious Chianti and then for my meal, I ordered a garden salad with their homemade Italian dressing {so yum!} and the piccata but subbed chicken for veal. It was SO tasty. I got it with a side of spaghetti that was just pretty average, I thought the noodles were a tad overdone but that is my only sorta complaint. All in all, I left SO full and ready for bed! Did someone say food coma? I would totally recommend Pasta Brioni for a family dinner, birthday, catering, you name it! They are also known for their cute Italian servers! ;)\n",
      "I would give 4 stars because the food was pretty fantastic but...read on. Great place to sit at the bar for late night happy hour! Bartender was super friendly and service was good. We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar. A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!\n",
      "A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds. Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes. Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite. The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill. We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!\n",
      "I had never heard of this place but went here for a rehearsal dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. We sat on the back patio which was great and our waiter was fantastic. The antipasto was delicious, as was the bread and oil for dipping. I wasn't able to order my own food since there was such a large group which was unfortunate, but they served a wide variety of pizza, and it was all pretty tasty. I would definitely eat here again.\n",
      "Decent Italian. Nothing more nothing less. Good service, and the staff was very friendly. Food was Eh, nothing that wowed or amazed me. I got the lasagna which was recommended to me by the waiter, and it was your average lasagna. A little too much cheese put on the top. Would most likely not return.\n",
      "We ended up here one night after grocery shopping, and craving Italian food (my partner is full blooded Italian -- Olive Garden just doesn't cut it). The prices? Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate. The eggplant rollatini was to die for. My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier. The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York. I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.\n",
      "The absolute best happy hour in the Valley! The food and drink options are wonderful especially the mussels and the happy hour wines are quite good. Did I mention the price? This place is affordable.\n",
      "LOVE THIS PLACE! My dad and I go here all the time! My dad loves the pizza, I am gluten free and love the chicken caesar. They staff is so friendly and know us by name. They have a casual side, formal side and a deli/ togo area. So really whatever mood you are in you will fit in! : )\n",
      "My favorite Italian place in Arizona, its a cozy atmosphere, terrific food and old school feel to it. A great dinner spot for date night!\n",
      "Being from Europe I tend to be avoid \"Italian\" restaurants in the US that lay the fake Italian on you thick. This wasn't the case for Pasta Brioni. I've been avoiding going because I tend to trust Yelpers but I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday and there were three of us. I tend to stay away from \"suggestions\" or \"specials\" bu the waiter did a great job of going over them and not being pushy. To start with the negatives, I'd say that my restaurant experiences (French,Italian or otherwise at least in Europe) begin with a few rolls of bread in a basket at your table and some butter (or olive oil). They weren't far off providing one roll and your customary olive oil but with a twist in that the bottle had an opening for balsamic vinegar which made for a great blend. I had the spinach and ricotta dumplings and the waiter was kind enough to suggest having it served with the vodka cream sauce. A great choice. My two friends had the capellini primavera (which I helped finish and it was delicious) and the chicken picatta (which I did not taste but looked equally good). All that capped with a bottle of Chianit and it was a great start to our Saturday night. I'd probably recommend it for a date or with family or a large group but definitely not for parents with young children as it wasn't necessarily the most casual place to dine.\n",
      "I have never written a Yelp review before. But, after a recent trip to Pasta Brioni, I found myself inspired to write my first. This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best. This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved. We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal. At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill. When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word. Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work. I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place. I prefer my pasta without the uppity Scottsdale attitude.\n",
      "Thank you for such a memorable night for our friends birthday! Charles and CJ were amazing and catered to all our needs! The food was fabulous (The salmon and eggplant is to die for) and we were all treated with the utmost respect despite being a difficult crew. A special thank you to Charles for even assisting us in taking the birthday girl to our car following dinner; she had a little too much fun prior to our wonderful experience at Pasta Brioni! Looking forward to going back soon! A+++++++\n",
      "So disappointing. Haven't gone in few years and decided to try. Wedge had wilted lettuce, tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor. Then the veal Chop. Served with frozen spinach, tasteless mushrooms drenched in butter and the chop itself was bland and blah. The ciopini was blah. Overall not good at all. Too bad, used to be great. what came first, no business or crap ingredients and no chef? Surprised it's still in business.\n",
      "Went with a groupon - would never have though of going otherwise. I am glad I did though. Food was spectacular. I had penne pasta from the special menu, with some kind of vodka sauce, peas, ham, cheese - it sounds boring but it was awesome. My partner had veal marsala - again awesome. We will be back - it is pricey but worth it\n",
      "Never again. We made reservations for 5:45 on a Saturday night, definitely did not need a reservation though, the place was dead. We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant. The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said \"once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!\". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too. I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table. I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread. My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal, he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said \"I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good\". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate). We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back. Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night.\n",
      "We've eaten here for years. However, it's been a little while since the last visit. The food has always been good, leaving me wanting more. That was until lastnight. Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients. The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness. Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree. This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp. Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list. It was very disappointing.\n",
      "Went on a recommendation of my nail technician, but I thought it was going to be better but that's probably my fault for setting the expectation. I found toasted ravioli after so long and it was pre-doused in marinara, bah. I wanted a dish that was on the dinner menu, but was told \"the kitchen is too busy tonight, can't do that\" so that was a bummer. The penne al vodka was okay, thus the 2 stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to order from there again.\n",
      "Took friends from Chicago to dine last night. Our waiter Michael just happened to be from the same neighborhood as my friends. Instant bonds were made. We had a great time, food was excellent and Michael was just perfect as our server. All the other waiters that stopped by our table for water bread etc were just as friendly. The place has a great family feel to it and without pressure to dine and leave. Will go back for sure!!!\n",
      "This is a cute little pasta joint. Very New Yorky feel minus Don Corleone :) I had their pasta pollo which was delicious! Drinks...well they are what they are... I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks except maybe a Irish car bomb Ouch! However, order a drink and sit at the bar. Bartender Brianna was pretty cool and she'll make you smile. Sitting area for dinner can get crowded but you get a more intimate feel. If your date likes pasta...well you know where to go now - good luck!\n",
      "What a wonderful experience! My parents were celebrating their 65th wedding anniversary and I booked the small wine cellar room for my family and out of town guests. The food was exceptional and the service was phenomenal. We had at least two waiters ensuring that our every need was met. Everyone had a wonderful evening that will not soon be forgotten. Thank you, Pasta Brioni!!\n",
      "Two couples, four different dishes and no complaints. The food was great and so was the service. I can't believe this restaurant is a stone's throw away from an Arby's.\n",
      "Great Italian food! Went on Christmas- great service, waiter was extra nice. All food was delicious. Great gluten free pasta too! Highly recommend!\n",
      "We were encouraged to try this restaurant by friends who had been to a birthday party here. We were mostly impressed. We had good service from arrival to departure. I think we were the only customers when we arrived at 1:25. The wine list was a disappointment. My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from. The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive. There are a lot of American wines Two of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy. Wife and I split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it. This is not an inexpensive lunch but the prices were not unreasonably high.\n",
      "Back for the first time in 16 years. Only thing I'm trying to figure out is why it took me so long to go back!! I ordered a special dish that they had just added to the menu, Penne Milano. Incredible. We had the homemade cheesecake which was the best I can remember in a very long time. The place has been updated and the ambience was great. I know it won't be 16 years before the next visit!\n",
      "Service: flawless. Host helped right away giving options of table, booth, bar and out door. Waiter was on his A game. Filling waters, getting orders, everything was great. No complaints. Food: yum! Italian food. Bug portions. Enough to split or take home for leftovers. Hot bread brought after ordering. On the table balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil available. We ordered a Caesar salad to share and I got the penne vodka with chicken. Pasta cooked well. Sauce was balanced. It is very good pasta. I will be returning. Environment/ambiance: very Italian restaurant. Had some TVs at the bar. Dark lighting. Outside was nice. everything was clean. Mixed crowd. More for quiet gatherings or dates. Lots of Frank Sinatra playing. Parking: lot, spacious.\n",
      "Continues to be a 5 STAR dining experience! Busiest time of the year, Car Auction, Horse Show, TPC . . But DAVID, Owner/Partner in charge of the dining room, had it running smoothly as always last night! COME HERE ONLY if you want great Italian food, a warm, intimate room, relaxed and non-pretentious staff, but most of all, GREAT ITALIAN FOOD ( . . . sorry, but we love this place. We've been coming here for years)! The menu is awesome, so many wonderful dishes, top quality (tonight we had Sea Bass, Shrimp and Shiitake Mushroom pasta, and I had an incredible Chicken, vegetable, penne pasta dish (wow, only 650 calories, couldn't believe it) and they were all fantastic as always. Love you Past Brioni, don't change a thing . . . see you again soon!\n",
      "horible sauce.......doubtful if fresh tomatoes used or even canned marzanos the sauce was a tomato paste and water and reminded me of what poor immigants ate when they arrived off the boat at ellis island.. decor predictable and keeps in line with other bronx-like establishments..oversized portions but who cares food is terrible would not return to casa brioni (marinara manor)\n",
      "My gfs and I went for happy hour. You have to sit at the bar to get the discount pricing. They pour large bottles of wine and pizza was tasty.. Looking forward to trying their pastas next!\n",
      "The food is pretty good, but it loses two stars for fact that you almost never get your entire order when you have it delivered. I'm not even talking complicated orders... a sandwich that comes with pasta salad will show up with no pasta salad more often than not.\n",
      "Food is good, but service is lacking. I had called in advance to inform that I would be bringing in my mother for her 80th birthday. The person I spoke with mentioned that they would have a special table ready for her and a cake. When we arrived, we were instructed to pick our own table; no special preparations. Had to ask multiple times for the parmesan cheese which, when finally brought out, was in a grinder that kept breaking on the waiter. At the completion of the meal that waiter asked, \"done yet\"? How about, \"ma'm are you finished yet\"? The olive oil was rancid. For the price of lunch ($74 for two), will not be back.\n",
      "Went to Pasta Brioni on a recommendation from the concierge at Talking Stick Resort and Casino. We had a great experience here. We sat out on the patio after being immediately greeted and welcomed and given a choice of sitting in the restaurant or outside. There is a nice mix of bar seating, dining room and patio. We went on a Wednesday night in March so it wasn't overly busy. The patio was nice and cozy and had good furniture and heat lamps incase. The waiter we had was named Stallone. He was great. Very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were long lost customers he hadn't seen in ages. We also met the restaurant owner Dave who was great. There was a medical incident in the restaurant while we were there and the staff handled the first responders and customer with attentiveness, class and dignity. We mentioned to Dave that we heard the cannoli was recommended but overpriced according to some other Yelp reviews so he brought us one on the house. Dish portions were large and we couldn't finish what we had ordered. Great night. One star was lost because of the location. Plaza is a bit sketchy looking and not in the most vibrant part of Scottsdale although it's been in that location for 20+ years which means they are doing something right\n",
      "Pasta Brioni was one of the first restaurants I tried out when I moved to the valley last year. The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!\n",
      "I have always adored this restaurant because the service is fantastic and the pasta is some of the best you'll find anywhere. This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do. Many thanks and kudos!\n",
      "I've been here twice and I get their rigatoni in marinara sauce, its delicious! Plus their nice warm breads that they bring out to start with are sooooo good! They have these different flavored butters that make them even better! Plus they waiters are all super friendly and very familiar with the menus. During lunch hour they stay on time and I'm always to get in and get out if I'm in a hurry.\n",
      "Penne vodka. Cannoli. You're good to go. Literally, you can eat in or just walk into the pickup door (north side of the building) and take any of their meals to go without needing to call ahead.\n",
      "Our introduction to Pasta Brioni was lackluster. I had heard great things about the food from friends and finally decided to try it for my birthday. We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion. There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back.\n",
      "Pasta Brioni in a nut shell: Hot waiters. Mediocre food.\n",
      "Authentic Italian food at a very reasonable price! Portions are huge, you'll have plenty of leftovers! They serve hot bread rolls with amazing sweet herb butter. Great service, elegant, relaxing atmosphere.\n",
      "Classic Italian Food. Great service. Our waiter was personable, and was very accommodating to our special requests. The decor is very nice, what you might expect from an upscale old Italian place on the east coast. Everyone loved the food. We started with a artichoke to share, and it was a great treat.\n",
      "Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni. I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths. We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited. My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.\n",
      "Took the girlfriend on Valentine's Day after making a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived they set a table and showed us to our table outside. It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance. They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs. Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect. We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm.\n",
      "while i cant speak about the looks of the men working there... I do think they only hire people from New York or Jersey... the servers have the all the attitude that you would expect out of a Sopranos episode... the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in the Bronx despite being in a strip mall... But by far the best thing this place has to offer is the food. while the menu is not too large and surprisingly does not have alot of Italian dishes most things they will make for you... for example last time i was there they made chicken parmesan... i would go out on a limb and say that if it is not on the menu they will probably make it for you... especially if you are a female! this is tops in the valley for the real deal itilano place that makes you feel like you are on the east coast\n",
      "I am sorry to give one star, but after the second attempt I can definitely say that the food is VERY DISAPPOINTING! I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting. Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special. I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.\n",
      "We have been looking for a great Italian restaurant in Phoenix for some time. This restaurant came highly recommended, so we drove 40 minutes to give it a try. David the owner took the time to welcome us to the restaurant, which was a nice change of pace. The food was fresh, and pasta dishes were amazing! We will definitely be back soon!\n",
      "This is the spot for a bachelorette party dinner! We had a group of 14 & were treated like the queens that we are. I hadn't been to Pasta Brioni in quite some time, but when we were organizing a bachelorette party one of us suggested this place for dinner because of the hot waiters (yeah, I'm just gonna be shallow, and not play coy about that) & its proximity to Old Town. I think they actually offer set menu deals for large parties, but with a group of girls (who may or may not by picky eaters) we didn't take advantage of this. I don't think any of the set menus include alcohol. I had the mushroom risotto & it was fantastic! It was creamy, but not too creamy, and they're was just the right amount of vegetables to risotto. I didn't care that I was amongst all girls, I happily ate the whole thing. Service was fantastic as well! I believe our waiter's name was John (I can't believe I can't 100% remember his name) & he definitely played up the fact this was a bachelorette party group. That being said, all of our orders were correct (except for one minor drink order) and everyone was very happy with the food and service. I should also point out the bachelorette got a special dessert at the end of the night ;) I would definitely come back to Pasta Brioni for any type of meal, but I would especially keep them in mind again for a large dinner party.\n",
      "I really wanted this place to be good, especially after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. But sadly, it was just mediocre. I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters. What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was. My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk. My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven. I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good. After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert. Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway. Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area. Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief.\n",
      "Just about everything here is top notch. Grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite, but have amazing pasta dishes, salads, numerous tasty sandwiches hot and cold. Even the pizza is among my favorites in town. They have a small patio that is not very inviting, and the restaurant is very old and somewhat run down. That's the only reason that I didn't give five stars. Though it's old, it's clean.\n",
      "My wife and I have been looking for a good Italian place in the area for some time. Another couple took us to dinner at Pasta Brioni. They've been going there for years and raved about the place.. The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking. Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal. The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese. The dish was very good and had lots of food. After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side. Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening. Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner. I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes..\n",
      "Food and portions were excellent. Staff was very friendly. We ate at the cafe side of the restaurant. They put together a few different dishes along with a salad that satisfied all our cravings. The chicken with eggplant and promiscuitto (sp) in a wine sauce was awesome. We would eat there again the next time we're in Phx.\n",
      "My husband and I took some family friends who were in town from Minnesota to Pasta Brioni for dinner. It was our first time dining here and we picked it mostly for the location and reviews. The food was delicious and portions were great. I am giving this a four star rather than five only because towards the end of our dinner I was parched and looking for our waiter for water refills, and the menu is a little on the expensive side.\n",
      "I'm not sure I will ever go back. Went to Pasta Brioni with my mom on Friday and after we were seated our server came over and said, \"Well let's get this show on the road.\" I guess the restaurant was expecting a large party so they didn't want to work before the party arrived. Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said \"Nahhhhhh\" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you.\n",
      "I tried the Spaghetti Bolognese and it was amazingly good. It tasted like my grandmother spaghetti. But was better. My grandmother would be jealous. Everything here is just amazing. Service is 5 stars by far!!\n",
      "Nasty calzonetti, undercooked dough and icky burn marks on the dough made for a terrible meal.\n",
      "Pasta Brioni...what can I say? This place has some of the best eggplant parm that has ever passed through my lips! Mmm mmm mmm! My boyfriend and I came here on a whim after another one of our fave Italin spots in Scottsdale (NY's Best Italian) closed and we were NOT disappointed! It may not be the fanciest or most romantic place from a décor & lighting perspective, but the food is amazing and reasonably priced. I did wish they had a bit more selection on the wine list but that's really a minor complaint. I loved my eggplant and my man loved his shrimp scampi pasta. And we BOTH loved the yummy fresh bread. You have definitely NOT seen the last of us Brioni!\n",
      "Went to this restaurant for the very first time with my family last night to celebrate a triple birthday. Our waiter was excellent- friendly, interactive and funny. Everyone at the table tried a drink they liked, myself- several bellini's were taken down. Delicious!! Ordered mussels for my appetizer and they gave a great sized portion- enough to share with the table and all were open and able to be eaten. The pasta alla vodka was incredible. The portion size was huge and I definitely have a bunch left over for lunch. I highly recommend this place!\n",
      "The food was BOMB! Order the eggplant rollantine with 4 cheese sauce in lieu of marinara. Must try it!!! The desserts were stellar. Pumpkin cheesecake and tiramisu = holy amazingness.\n",
      "So I've ordered delivery from pasta Brioni before because their penne vodka never disappoints. But last night my boyfriend and I wanted to do a low key date night and I was craving Italian that wasn't going to break the bank. I think I can speak for both of us when I say we made a great choice in choosing Pasta Brioni. We ate on the lounge side which is very casual and low key. the vibe is like an old school Italian place- Sinatra playing and all. The food, as I expected, was delicious, but more importantly the service was top notch. Our server Brian was really awesome! Prompt, friendly and funny. I'm honestly surprised that anyone would give this place less than 5 stars.... But oh well, more pasta for me because we will definitely be back!!\n",
      "Absolutely amazing .... went w my aunt and uncle and we had spaghetti, shrimp scampi, and eggplant and ALL were amazing! Evan is awesome - even as an Australian ;) Highly Recommend!!!!\n",
      "Outstanding service! I simply do not understand why this place isn't packed all the time. The food is delicious and the service is superb! We eat out often and good Italian food is hard to find in Scottsdale but this is certainly the best.\n",
      "Still Excellent! Mussels were super. Linguini with clams and 4 cheese rigatoni delicious. Needs better selection of craft beers.\n",
      "Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale! Been coming here for years and am always impressed. The service makes you feel at home and the food is amazing!\n",
      "Pasta Brioni is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Scottsdale! I love the Penne Vodka pasta with pees! This restaurant was the first place I went out to eat when I moved to Scottsdale and I've loved it ever since. I also love that there is a section just for fast take out, so during the day it is quick and easy and during the night it is a nice dine-in restaurant. It is affordable and delicious! So glad I came across it the first day I moved to Scottsdale!\n",
      "We arrived in Scottsdale after a long drive from Santa Fe. We were hungry! Sadly we forgot about the time change and showed up for dinner early! It was not a problem, despite the fact the chef was doing prep (loudly) in the kitchen we were welcomed and given a table. I know they weren't ready for prime time but they didn't bat an eye. We ordered and food arrived. The food was delicious. I had the salmon on a bed of spinach with capers and risotto. It was garlicky delicious! Hubby had the same thing he always orders, Chicken Parmesan. It disappeared. We were full but the waiter suggested some \"home made dessert.\" We chuckled and asked who's home? He said the Chefs wife does the desserts, then named off the offerings. We had to have (shared mine you) the cheesecake. It was a perfect finish to our meal. Thank you all for making our first meal in Scottsdale a memorable one! Now if someone would just turn down the furnace....Phoenix in July? Oh my!\n",
      "Great place, way bigger than it looks because of all the separate rooms. A nice lounge/bar area is vibrant to the left of the entrance. The bread service is awesome - scratch made rolls with a hint of parm and garlic. They were heavy in a good way - a cross between a lighter pretzel roll and either a popover or a brioche roll or maybe 1/3 the way between all three! The eggplant rolatini appetizer can easily be a light entree - with plain noodles it would be a full meal! The ricotta filling was fluffy, light, creamy AND flavorful. So good! The vitello sorrentino was amazing! Tender veal medallions dusted in flour and pan fried with a wine butter sauce. Service was excellent by Leah. They also offer pizzas and calzones mostly at lunch and we would like to try those on our next visit.\n",
      "Second visit to Scottsdale -- second visit to Pasta Brioni. First time was great. This time -- \"eh\". Ordered the mussels in a tomato broth (this was very good). Husband said his chicken parm was just okay; friend's spaghetti and meatballs same thing -- just okay. My salmon was a bit on the fishy side and I was uber thirsty the entire night. Actually had to get up out of bed for water during the night. Seemed pricey for what we got ($40/per person) - with 1 drink each. Probably won't go back. Have since heard that ownership has changed and really -- it wasn't worth the drive from Surprise. Sorry.\n",
      "Food is always great and they have superior wait service. Never a bad meal or dinning experience.\n",
      "i don't know why i have no problem going into bars alone in non-english speaking developing countries and fucking shit up but in my own country i feel like a total twat doing it. some of my most memorable travel experiences started with me alone in a bar with a book- dancing on tables with randoms i met in ljublijana, clubbing with the croatian water polo team in dubrovnik, midnight motorcycle rides with cambodian teens in siem reap. so what the fuck is wrong with me that i had to talk myself into going to a bar alone in scottsdale?? yes, true, i am in a red state and on many levels that scares the shit out of me. i just don't know. yes, i brought my computer to do some work, and i sat at the bar, but i was consciously self-conscious. maybe this is a sign of aging. i don't like it. i do like pasta brioni. it is walking distance from the mother's house, and i think the happy hour aint bad. i had a huge glass of wine, raviolis and a single yet potent meatball. the total? 10.80. is it the best italian food i've had. not even close, but it's filling, not bad and as there are others eating solo at the bar, i felt less lame. given, the others at the bar were mostly above 65. it kinda made me feel happy that women live longer than men, so when im that age most of my friends' husbands may be dead (knocks on wood) so that at least i can go with my aged pussy posse years from now.\n",
      "I've been here several times over the years. It seems like it's losing its mojo a little. The decor is a bit shabby and in need of a refresh. On a Saturday night it was pretty dead. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very nice. Her tattoos were great! The beer selection was kinda weak. Memo to Brioni: there's a craft beer revolution going on and Sam Adams and Blue Moon don't cut it any more. The bread is very good and the linguine pescatore is always a winner. I had an OK experience here but just not as good as I've remembered from past visits over the last 15 years.\n",
      "Ordered the pizza online and it came early which is a plus. Pizza was good, a little heavy since it was a four cheese but can't knock it for that. Crust was great though. Plus it was big so I guess I have lunch for three days. Woohoo!! Online ordering was easy and convenient. Will order from them again!\n",
      "We ordered to go on a tues night and it took 1hr and 15 min. They had a tin of orders and we were told it would be that long. That being said, it was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken luccabratzi, which is a huge pounded out chicken breast with a salad on top. K had a pasta Primavera and added chicken. It was a huge portion with a ton on fresh vegetables. He also had a ceaser salad. It was all delivered hot and fresh. We loved it. $40 including tip. Not bad! Would definitely order from them again!\n",
      "Nice staff, good choices on menu. We ordered the calamari-- not sure how you screw fried calamari up but Pasta Brioni managed to, in the fryer too long. The pasta meals we ordered were decent. Nothing great or special. They handled a large group well though and the service was good. Oh and the bread is really good too.\n",
      "A very nice spot for a quiet lunch. Very good service and great food. The chicken salad is amazing and so is the vodka sauce.\n",
      "It's been years since I've eaten at Pasta Brioni. The food was as good as I remember and a good bang for the buck. The service however was a little off the mark. We were seated in the back which may have caused delays in our server getting to and checking up on us but that is no excuse, we are in your restaurant and should be treated as well as customers in the front room.\n",
      "The red sauce has no flavor. The chicken martini was soggy....not crispy, I specifically asked for crispy. It was a soggy mess. I also requested light sauce. Again. Soggy. The butter served with the bread was sweet.... ? The worse part was the loud private conversation of the wait staff and the bartender. They stood right behind us and were extremely loud, laughing shouting.....Really horrible. The dust on the blinds (that we were right next too) was an inch thick. Needless to say, not good. I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy. Even the beet salad was terrible. How do mess that up, try Terrible dressing, bitter lettuce. Some sort of beet that tasted sour and old. We will not be back. Again I wonder where the owner is and if he eats there.\n",
      "Went here a few weeks ago for a \" girls night \" dinner before heading out and it was AMAZING. I am Italian, and pretty much a Italian food snob and this place felt like I was eating Sunday Dinner at my grandma's house. We signed up for their e-mails online and scored buy 1 get 1 free vouchers. We ( group of 5 ) ordered a few entrees and shared: Antipasto salad, chicken martini, spinach and ricotta dumplings ( AMAZING - and I am not a big ricotta cheese fan, but these were superb ) the bread was great - the service was friendly and very good. Not sure whats up with some of these negative reviews - but it's a excellent italian spot and I will continue to return.\n",
      "We wanted to find some good Italian food and saw the high rating and rave reviews on Yelp so figured this was a good bet. We were right. The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff. The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help? Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue. The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good. The only downside was locating it. When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility. It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street. We drove by a couple of times before figuring that out - just glad we didn't give up and miss out on the great meal!\n",
      "I felt like I was \"back home\" in a Boston Italian restaurant. I let our waiter know that we had never been there and hoped to be impressed since we have our \"favorite\" italian restaurants but were here on a recommendation. Their specials all sounded fabulous. I had the gnocchi with spinach and tomatoes - yum. We all loved the food. Most of all, this restaurant truly puts the emphasis on service. The staff was all attentive and it showed.\n",
      "My favorite Italian in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Great location in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I recommend the eggplant rollatini as an appetizer and the Rigatoni four cheese for a main course. If you saved room for desert they also offer some nice homemade cakes and other sweets :)\n",
      "I've passed the place for years and have always wanted to try it. I found them as a delivery option on Grub hub, wish I knew they delivered this whole time. The spaghetti is delicious, the lasagna is delicious, and the caprese salad is fancier than any other I've had and delicious :-)\n",
      "I was craving pasta with something ... something I can't make at home. Some kind of... I don't know. Comfort food with flair, if you will. We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too. Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu \"along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu.\" ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay. It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal. Oh, my date had that lasagna and I didn't try it, but was told \"Fine.\" when asked how it was, and he was actually talking about the food (and not some I'm-mad-at-you-but-not-telling-you boyspeak). It looked like it had cheese on top. No shit, it's lasagna. Not a good descriptor, I know.\n",
      "Was in the mood for Italian and figured we would give this place a try. Wow, what a great decision. The food is amazing, I ordered the Chicken Gorgonzola and it did not disappoint.\n",
      "Back at Pasta Brioni for another incredible meal. The new owner has made a lot of improvements, had a prime ribeye which melted in my mouth. We were running errands in Scottsdale and showed up without a reservation...MISTAKE! The restaurant was packed and we were lucky to get a table...next time I'll call first.\n",
      "If I was a local and powerful don and I needed somewhere from which to run my crime syndicate, this would be my home base. Either here or Christos in Phoenix. It has that formal Chicago/New York Italian feel to it...and I like it a lot. Ambiance aside, the food is the real attraction. Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality, resembling the perfect blend of taste and presentation.\n",
      "The chicken parmesan sandwich continues to top the charts. It is really the undefeated champion in this category. The sandwich is always loaded with the best tasting cutlets, sauce and just enough cheese to keep me happy. At about 10 bucks, based on the size, you should be able to eat one half only for lunch and save the rest. Unfortunately, I have only been able to accomplish that feat once due to not being able to stop eating the addictive food. The pasta salad also makes a nice side dish with it's creamy taste. Great lunch and/or dinner.\n",
      "Food is good, but the service is lacking and they somehow manage to f*ck up every delivery as of late, which is why I haven't ordered from them as much as I used to. Great for dining in, but not sure I would recommend the delivery unless you don't mind eating something you didn't order or getting stuck having to go to the store to get your own damn beverages, I mean, how difficult is it to check the order before you leave with it?!?! -_-\n",
      "Thank you Pasta Brioni for another great dining experience. We don't get there as often as we would like but each time we are there you can be guaranteed we will come back. Excellent service and food that is out of this world. We love introducing our family and friends to Pasta Brioni as they too are always ready to go back there\n",
      "Service was pretty good. Our waiter was really nice, but kept calling my mom sweetheart and we thought that was a little weird. It was super hot in there, to the point I felt sick. Kind of hurried to get out of there, because of this. They started with water, then brought one roll on a plate to each of us, then our drinks and meal. I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and iced tea and my mom ordered originally the Chx Marsala, but he recommended the Chx Eggplant meal (forgot name) so she got that. Food was pretty good. Nothing too amazing. Bill was $40 almost for two of us. Just expected more for the price of it. Will I go back? Eh? Maybe....\n",
      "For AZ this is one of the best Italian restaurants. The food is good. I love the chicken and creamy red sauce and rigatoni dish the best. The pizza is also very good. They ambiance is fine. The prices are reasonable. Also a good central location with plenty of parking\n",
      "There's a saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" and it is a good saying! The sign isn't the best, but trust me, you need to stop your car and go here STAT! We walked in and it just smelled amazing- that's a good start in my book! We were greeted by a friendly server and given fresh bread (made in house). The bread was phenomenal and soft. It went great with some balsamic, spices and oil dipping sauce. We chose the calamari as an appetizer and two pasta dishes that were equally as delicious and fresh as the bread. I could've kicked myself for not coming here sooner! This place is a gem! The pasta dishes were roughly $18 each and the appetizer was $10, if I remember correctly. Perfectly priced for the large quantity and fresh quality. One of the best parts of the restaurant is that it truly was a gem. It was definitely a place of the locals and not touristy and it was a great vibe for a week night date. The ambiance was lovely and the kitchen, while open, was pretty much quiet. What a beautiful little restaurant! Thank you for a wonderful evening, we will be back for sure!\n",
      "4 words -cold chicken pasta salad! i LOVE this place. i try to make a trip here at least every other week on my lunch breaks. I usually go to the \"to go\" side of the restaurant just because i'm grabbing a quick lunch during work. i have always had fantastic, fast, friendly service. i strongly recommend you going here for a lunch or even a romantic evening out. Always a winner!\n",
      "I only mention this because of all the women reviewers commenting on \"the hot waiters\". I remember a very friendly and attractive female bartender- This is Scottsdale, home of the beautiful people. Anyway, I like this place- Not real pricey or pretentious (rare in this town). Good basic food and drinks- great service, esp at the bar!! Suggest Linguini and clams or calamari.\n",
      "There's just something about Sunday night and pasta. It goes together like... tomatoes and mozzarella? Last night, I made my way to this neighborhood pasta shop for a family dinner. My meal was spectacular. I ordered the Linguini with seafood and I'm pretty sure the entire ocean was on my plate...in a good way. They brought out the plate of Linguini with all the seafood toppings including squid, shrimp, oysters, clams and probably some fish I couldn't even name for you. At any rate, it was delish! The pasta sauce complimented the fish perfectly and I found myself eating much more of it than I should have. So speaking of seafood, Pasta Brioni accidentally must have merged with a sushi joint last night and they accidentally brought my Mom her halibut more on the \"still swimming\" side of the plate rather than cooked. When we brought it to the server's attention he was mortified and I will say this... Because of how apologetic the server was, how they handled the situation and how accommodating they were with their mistake, I don't see a reason to have the experience alter my impression of Pasta Brioni. They brought my Mom out a new meal in record time and we were well on our way, after delicious Tiramisu and some chocolate mousse plate of goodness of course! In summary, sometimes it's entirely about how a restaurant handles unfortunate situations. It seemed like the kitchen just had a \"whoops\" moment and that happens to the best of us, so for that I give them a get out of jail free card. Other restaurants should follow their customer service lead! Plus, I think I might have been in my own food coma of happiness from my own meal. Is it bad that I couldn't wait for my Mom to get her replacement meal and instead scarfed down my personal ocean on a plate? I did give her a little taste as she waited for her own.\n",
      "Great atmosphere and when it is cooler we will definitely be back to sit on the patio we walked by! We had a bunch of ladies meet up that have never been here before. We each tried a different dish while sharing a bottle of Barbara red wine. Dishes we ordered were a Cesar salad, bolonese, linguine pescatore, penne vodka---all great Italian food! Deserts were homemade cheesecake, flour less cake and tiramisu that we ordered. Sitting in the bar area at a table was great atmosphere for our ladies laughing and telling stories. The chef stopped by our table and even stayed to chat with us. We had a great time and will be back again!\n",
      "I've been coming to this restaurant for about 17 years and I'm still a big fan. Although it has had some ups and downs, the service and food have always been no less than above par. Our most recent visit was one of the best I've had in the last past couple of years. The service was prompt, attentive, and delivered with personality (Mike - great job). We started off sharing the Beet salad, which was something I've never had before. The presentation was unique and the flavor, ingredient ratio, and amount were very satisfying. We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Martini as entrees, which I think are some of the best in town without a doubt. I was so eager to dive in that I forgot to take a picture. We'll definitely be coming back again soon - more than once.\n",
      "Pasta, pasta, pasta... Yes, please! I love their spaghetti and meatballs. Go there during happy hour and you will not be disappointed. It was a little warm in the bar area.\n",
      "Amazing food! It was a little pricey but worth it. The service was great and the food was out in a timely manner. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and cute! If you are looking for a good italian meal, I would go to Pasta Brioni.\n",
      "Loved it. service was great, food was great . Medium pricey but for the food you can't complain.\n",
      "Food was delicious and the ambiance was very nice. They homemade cheesecake dessert was the perfect ending to the meal.\n",
      "I'll start with the Pros. My meal was very good I couldn't stop eating it. Laid back atmosphere. Server was friendly and put together a meal for my friend that wasn't on the menu. The cons were the portion sizes were massive. I know in the Italian culture pasta is served in big portions, but I took half of the dish home, and pasta the next day is just not the same. Since the prices are high and you get what you pay for, I'd rather have a smaller portion with a lower price. I ordered what I believed to be a side ceaser salad. That was also huge, seemed like a whole head of lettuce. It was very tasty, maybe a bit to much dressing that caused it to be not crispy. It was also disappointing the server didn't offer to crack pepper on the salad and pasta, and offer grated cheese on the pasta. To be honest, I would have been happy with the bread and salad and I would have been full for 6.50. Yes, the side salad was 6.50, that was a bit ridiculous. I had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well. So I think lowering the prices and the amount of food they give you can set this place over the top.\n",
      "I've eaten their food at least a dozen times, but have always gotten it To-Go. Having tried several dishes, I can honestly say the food is decent. It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst. The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order. I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home. Pricing is okay. Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I). I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery.\n",
      "The food and service here are always stellar! We last ate at Pasta Brioni on 8/9/15. There were 9 of us and we all thought our pasta was some of the best we'd ever had. Caleb was our waiter and he was awesome - very knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive and very funny!\n",
      "THE BRIONI BOYS ARE BACK!!! And they are serving the best authentic Italian food in the hood. Wine selection is phenomenal. Even the bread is much better now.The patio now has a real comfy feeling. I, always sit at the bar, and personally have tried every item on the happy hour menu. My favorite is still spaghetti and meatballs or the 4 cheese rigatoni But you must come on Thursday night to listen to great jazz and watch one of the BOYS pour your favorite wine.\n",
      "Amazing food with even better service. If you are in the area and looking for delicious Italian food, this is the place to go!\n",
      "Just wanted to add that I received a personal message from the owner apologizing for our experience and promising a better one next time. In this day and age of no customer service, this was a very classy and professional touch. We'll be back.\n",
      "The food here rocks, the service is marginal. However, were in Az & delicious Italian is so hard to come by that I overlook the short falls. Love there vodka sauce & white pie.\n",
      "Very impressed with this restaurant. We had the Halibut (daily special) and the lamb. The lamb was perfectly done and very flavorful. Halibut also very good. Our waiter was also 5 star and helped make the whole meal perfect. We will be back. Don't forget to try the cheesecake. They call it NY cheesecake, but it is really better than that.\n",
      "One word...DELICIOUS!! When we walked in we were greeted by what I'm not sure was the owner, chef or both. But he had is white jacket on and was pretty involved with all of the tables pretty much the whole time. We ordered a veal bolognese and the chicken Parmesan. Both were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were huge! Our server was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions for dinner! It's super casual but you could still wear something nice if you were feeling it. I will definitely return here. And next time I may share a dish so I can have some tiramisu. A must try!!\n",
      "Today the food fell a little short of expectations, I ordered the nightly special which was lobster and shrimp risotto. The lobster tails were smaller than a typical tail, not a small portion as the dish came with two tails and two shrimp plus the risotto The reason I mentioned the tail size is it might be a variety I have not had before, the lobster had a great grilled taste but had a texture that was not what was expected , not the buttery softness I associate with lobster (overcooked?). The risotto was cooked to the right consistency but could have used more butter and cream (or what it is they use to make risotto delicious) I'm guessing the chef didn't taste this batch before it went out. The staff was great, our server was Jason or Thomas. 4 stars based on years of patronage and have always experienced excellent service and quality food with today's exception on the food missing the mark..\n",
      "This place is amazing. Very cute. And very trendy. The service was great. Water was full at all times. The bread rolls are amazing. The food is exquisite. I had the chicken pesto and it was so creamy and full of flavor. I came here with girls and I would recommend this place for date night. They dim the lights after 8 pm and its just a very cozy feel. I will be visiting again soon.\n",
      "I really wanted to like this joint, I havent enjoyed pasta for a few months and was really looking forward to consuming food here. Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said \"Nope, can't do it we have people outside.\" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids.\n",
      "I have been coming to Brioni's for years. Since I moved out of the area I have not been here in a long time. On my birthday a large group of us were planning on going out to dinner but did not decide on a place until the last minute. Of course they could not take a party of 8... what was I thinking. Anyway we came to the decision of Pasta Brioni so I gave them a call and they were very accommodating. Within 15 minutes of getting there we were sat. Our server was great and very knowledgeable. The food was as good as I remember. I will always be a customer of Pasta Brioni.\n",
      "Love this place, they have the best vodka sauce in town. Service can be a little slow during the day.\n",
      "The waiters are pretty hot.. well not all of them but many.. the food is so so.. service, if I had bigger boobs I think the service would have been better.. would not return.. I wake up to a hot man every morning so I have no worries about checking the waiters out again.\n",
      "Family owned and operated Pasta Brioni has the feel of a New York City Italian Restaurant. All the waiters here are young, hot, hunks who even have there own calender. Come here for the delicious Italian dishes and I am not sure if I am talking about the food or the waiters!\n",
      "First time here. Great little place. Nice, but not to fancy. Great food and atmosphere. Would recommend !\n",
      "Where to start, let's just saw Awful!!!!! Service was ok, waiter was pleasant. Ordered the angel hair with chicken, it showed up almost 10 minutes after every one else was served, and when it did, the pasta was almost RAW... How do you screw up angel pasta, well they did. Another in our party had the eggplant parm. They should call it no eggplant pram...barely any eggplant...overall, ever rated, over priced, and just not very good....\n",
      "The calamari appetizer & Chicken Martini were out of this world delicious! We had dinner served family style for a group of 40. The food service was well coordinated & efficient. And the Brioni Boyz are never a disappointment! ; )\n",
      "Awesomesauce. No seriously, they have awesome sauce. The food is amazing. I didn't give a 5 star review cause the Calamari was meh and as an Italian restaurant I expect good calamari. Other than that, the service was top notch, the food was amazing and in large portions and overall great, old school mom and pop Italian restaurant. I got the 4 cheese Rigatoni with grilled chicken and the bf got The Chicken Parm and it was superb. Pasta done al dente just right and the grated Parm at the table, you know its authentic Italian. Good stuff all around and priced right.\n",
      "So all this hype on hot waiters had this place on my list to do on my Stay-cation. Sad to say, I was majorly disappointed! A group of gals hit this place for a late lunch on a Friday. The server acted like he was bothered from the get-go. The service was slow and he was rude and cold. The food was pretty good. I had meatballs and capellini. The sauce was one of the best I have had. My friends enjoyed pizza and a meatball sandwich. I would possibly return for the good food. The service left something to be desired, especially a hot hospitable Italian man.\n",
      "I really enjoyed my experience here. Our waiter was super attentive and recommended the amazing salmon salad. I don't like eggplant but the eggplant in this salad was really good. The pesto pasta was just alright. It really didn't meet my expectations which was sad. The salad and service was good enough.\n",
      "Tonight my husband and I ordered delivery and let me tell you it was phenomenal!! We ordered the mussels for starters, Caesar salad, cheesy garlic bread and the penne vodka pasta with chicken! We dipped the bread in the delicious tomato garlic basil sauce that the mussels came drenched in and that was heaven in itself. Delivery came within 20 minutes of my phone call and the service over the phone and at our door was great! So happy we found a new delicious favorite!\n",
      "I've been coming here for years, and it's always been my favorite Italian restaurant in town. But my feelings skyrocketed to a whole new level when I sat and had dinner at the bar alone tonight. Laura, my beautiful bartender was not only a great server but very knowledgeable about the menu(because I tested her on it). A restaurant that has always focused on their male servers is getting a facelift! Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar with her. Pasta Brioni is a must try and must frequent!\n",
      "Been here many times over........ Where are the beautiful waiters go? service is ok but I was told they all went to Un Baccio....food is still ok but service with beautiful waiters made this place awsome....:(\n",
      "Awesome food, better service, and an awesome staff! Great happy hour on the bar side. Wendee rules!!!\n",
      "Great chicken penne vodka! They forgot my chicken once on a to go order and they sent a fresh order to my home and added in a piece of chocolate cake! Fast service. Good food.\n",
      "Great Happy Hour and the food is always amazing. Home made pasta and always a special board full of creative dishes. Highly recommend\n",
      "Love this place! They always remember us and the food is real awesome Italian food!\n",
      "I've been going to this restaurant for many years and it is by far the most amazing Italian food in Arizona. All the dishes are old school, traditional Italian recipes that are to die for, and the seafood is always so fresh. The desserts are ALWAYS amazing, their cheesecake is my all time favorite. My grandparents introduced me to this restaurant many, many years ago and we have never had anything but top notch service and consistently great food. Pasta Brioni is a Scottsdale staple, there simply isn't any other restaurant that could compare.\n",
      "This is a good local spot for Italian. The food is amazing and the service is usually pretty good. Delivery options make it convenient to order on late work nights. Oh, and check the staff calendar if you get a chance!\n",
      "We were in Scottsdale for training and had met the owner Brian the previous evening. He implored us to come see him for lunch the following day, \"we were going to love it\". What a mistake. The food was slightly better than Olive Garden. We walked in and there was nobody to greet us, we wandered past the kitchen and asked the cook if they were open. Our server was working the place by himself, it took FOREVER for any service. There was one other table in the place beside us, and it was slooooooooooooow.Well over an hour for lunch, with four people in our party, and one other couple in the restaurant. No lunch prices, just a dinner menu, I spent 27 dollars plus tip for a bowl of pasta and a glass of iced tea. (great rolls though.) The owner never bothered to come out and say hello, or thank us for coming to his restaurant. How they have stayed in business as long as they have is beyond me.\n",
      "Amazing Food. We liked it so much we came back the next night with some of our friends. Spinach and ricotta dumplings melt in your mouth, and everything from the chicken Parmesan to the beet salad was delicious. Wonderful ambiance and reasonable prices. Great for every day dinner as well as out of town guests.\n",
      "Attentive wait staff and quick service. I love that whole wheat pasta can be substituted on request. The Capelini Primavera is fresh, and the serving is quite generous. You definitely get what you pay for here. Can't believe I didn't try this place sooner!\n",
      "Good italian food, but not five star. I had a huge pepperoni and lettuce salad but it was chopped really fine, not my preference. Best surprise was the sauce on the mussel appetizer, ask for more bread to soak it up. Plus the olive oil and balsamic on the table were fantastic. Huge servings.\n",
      "Pasta Brioni is one of our favorite restaurants in old town Scottsdale. It is a pleasure to see a restaurant where the owner is a visible presence! We had the veal, Caesar salad, calamari, and everything was awesome. We will be back again soon!\n",
      "As an Italian, I am picky to say the least. If you want good old school and authentic Italian this is the place!\n",
      "This was our first visit to Pasta Brioni based on high marks from several friends. The atmosphere and service were fine but the food was disappointing. Our shrimp risotto was more like shrimp and wild rice and the linguini pesto chicken needed salt to bring out the flavor and I never salt my food. Disappointing food in both our meals. Maybe other dishes are better but it will be a long time before we go again to find out. Save your money, there are several better choices within walking distance.\n",
      "Most ridiculous happy hour ever! This restaurant has a bar side & a dining room side. There are stools at the bar & some booths on bar side. We arrived for happy hour & all stools were taken so we sat in a booth in the bar. Waiter told us that the happy hour prices were only good AT the bar. We said But we are IN the bar! He said sorry. 33% HIGHER price for drinks AND food 3 feet from the bar. IDIOTIC! We went to Roaring Fork, nicer place, pub tables, lower prices for drinks & food at their happy hour. They lost us as customers & we live in the neighborhood!\n",
      "Wow. So good. Can't believe I hadn't eaten here sooner. The flourless chocolate cake was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Awesome patio. The Vodka Penne was amazing too.\n",
      "Excellent Italian dining at a reasonable price. Reservations required as the restaurant is small. I had the pasta Bolognese. Delicious, rich, cooked perfectly. Huge portion. Had more than enough to take home for another meal. My wife had the eggplant lasagna. Very good. Had the cannoli for dessert. Probably the best I've ever eaten. Why only four stars? The waiter was completely disinterested. He came over and asked if we were ready to order. When we hesitated for a couple of seconds, he immediately said he'd come back later. Really? After our meal was served, he never returned to ask how our meal was. Or to refill our water glass. Now, this wasn't some college student. It was apparent he was one of the managers as he was dressed in a sleeves rolled up shirt and slacks. We would go back again as this is one of the few restaurants in the Phoenix area that knows how to cook real Italian food that's also delicious and plentiful.\n",
      "I went here last night despite quite a few yelpers giving it a thumbs down. But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the \"other side\" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the \"to go\" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question.\n",
      "We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday. We chose Pasta Brioni based on the Yelp reviews. I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives. The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full. This is where the service stopped. We were sat without menus for 10 minutes. Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials. Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink. A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item. He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter. After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order. He took our food order and turned and left. I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order. Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink. I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened. He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do. I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins. Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner. The manager? or host? apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly. Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either. Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it. My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done.\n",
      "I am very pleased with my experience at Pasta Brioni. Definitely on the pricey side but I was taking my girlfriend to dinner on Valentine's day so that it was a special occasion. It was evident that the staff was working in a very stressful environment with almost every seat filled but I was impressed with their professionalism and friendliness regardless. The environment was beautiful as we were seated outside (thanks to the beautiful Arizona weather). Our waiter was very friendly. He was very helpful and made pleasant conversation. Many of the staff was interactive with the people and seemed to legitimately have fun in doing their job. The food was just as amazing as the service. I got the penne vodka with chicken and a garden salad. She got the rigatoni pasta with meatballs and a Ceasar salad. AMAZING. Paid 65 including a 15 dollar tip. Overall they helped make our Valentine's day experience amazing and this business deserved all the credit in the world for their amazing food and professionalism. I am a huge fan. Thanks again Pasta Brioni!\n",
      "Excellent service and food. Very family-like restaurant. Good take on a date restaurant or a good just sit down and eat great food.\n",
      "Very Very friendly staff.....Love their pasta dishes....Personally I am not a fan of the way they prepare their chicken HOWEVER many folks I went with loved it..\n",
      "Hotel Indigo is all about being cool. There are no city maps available because that is not cool. There is no parking garage or parking lot because that is not cool. There is no free breakfast buffet because that is not cool. The elevator, common areas and room décor is all about glam and being cool. I could see how I would have loved to go there at some specific occasions in my life. The hotel is in the gentrified area of the city and it is in good shape. The bottom line is that a hotel should provide you with the quality temperature and sound levels to facilitate rest. Indigo did that hence that is what counts the most, not the mistakes by reception or missing items for the room coffee. I got a good rest there and I appreciate that.\n",
      "We visited Pittsburgh to check out \"Pitt.\" Though we were a little misled about how far it is from campus (15 minutes is realistic) it didn't matter. The entire staff couldn't have been nicer. It's in a neighborhood experiencing huge revival (East Liberty). We used valet to the max. The beds are fabulous. The shower was huge. Great TV. Free Wi-Fi. The decor is cool. Anything else you want? Oh yeah--the bar. Well, we didn't check out the bar! But if we end up being parents of a Pitt student, this is where we will stay again.\n",
      "Great hotel in a very convenient location walkable to Whole Foods, Google, Target, etc. Looks like a new hotel, with boutique/hip elements but not exorbitant prices. Large rooms with character, extra spacious shower. Friendly service. Noticed some Google folks stay here too. Way more personality than the nearby Springhill Suites. A couple adjacent blocks have dollar stores and check cashers; the main adjacent block has a large Presbyterian church on Highland Ave.\n",
      "One of the best hotels I've stayed in. My boyfriend and I were visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and needed something reasonably priced but able to offer a great experience. This is the place. It's close to many things like Target, a Whole Foods, liquor store and even a pretty good Mexican place. The room was very clean when we arrived, a huge bed with soft linen and a spacious bathroom. Great wifi connection & plenty of channels to scroll through. I have nothing bad to say about our stay, this place was the best thing we did for our trip. Just a tip: try to find parking in the street behind the hotel, Whitfield, for free instead of paying 24 bucks/night.\n",
      "I can't say enough good things about this place! Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, especially the valets. The room is super cute and trendy, comfortable bed, great bathroom, good wifi. I hope it remains as affordable as it is now ($120 night for a June weekend stay booked on Expedia). I will definitely be staying here again when I visit Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Very nice hotel in what seems like an neighborhood going through a transformation. The hotel was true to the art Deco description. Patrick at the front desk was very helpful with everything from finding food at 3:00am to fixing an extra charge. While we didn't eat at the restaurant, the menu looked good and the food smelled great every time we passed through the lobby.\n",
      "Booked a double room ahead of time. Checked in and was told all they had were single, king bedrooms. Didn't work as there were 3 of us. Manager said it wasn't his problem as I booked through a 3rd party site. Told him I called the hotel directly to tell them of my request and he didn't get it. Then asked for a cot or rollaway, which was told they didn't have any. Ended up sleeping on the floor. Had to call down to get pillows and blankets. Not offered them by the \"manager\". I used quotes as he was a pitiful excuse for one. Noticed there was a maintenance worker on my floor with 2 open doors. Looked inside to see unfinished, double rooms. Guess that was one of my rooms, which they didn't have ready. Woke up at 4pm to idiots screaming in the alley. Since I didn't want to pay $20 per day to park, I found a spot on the street. Had to continuously check to make sure my car wasn't broken into or stolen. With broken liquor bottles in the gutter and shady characters loitering, not the greatest area. I wouldn't recommend the hotel for single, female business travelers. As I was checking out at 6am, I was offered coffee. Waited 5 minutes only for the front desk clerk to tell me they didn't have any. For $250 a night, I expected a lot more. Probably not worth half that. Very disappointing.\n",
      "The hotel has rejected my review several times, claiming I mentioned other hotels (not true). Doubtless it's because I mentioned the toilet paper in the toilet when we checked in and other signs that the bathroom was used after it was \"cleaned\" (smeary faucet, hair in sink). The main indication that it was cleaned was the TP roll folded into the little triangle hotels like to use to say, \"Ok, guest, we're ready for you.\" Ok, everybody makes mistakes (although this one's pretty bad for a hotel), so we reported this immediately to the front desk. They promised to send someone up to the room. We left for several hours, only to return to find nothing had changed. The rest of the room was pretty nice, so it's too bad the hotel chooses to react to criticism by trying to hide it. That just makes me think this is more than a one-off problem.\n",
      "I had the pleasure of attending an event at this amazing hotel and let me just say, it exceeded my expectations. I have never been much of a \"hotel snob\" but this place surely set the bar high. They had me at \"dog friendly\" although the rest of the evening just got better and better. But yes, you can bring your dog, to the bar, like yes, inside and have a drink with you. Um, awesome! There is a rich history enveloped by the hotel's ambiance and you can really tell the folks here are proud of what they have done with the place. The culture embedded in all of the tiny details really blew me away. Chef Jose and the Wallace Tap Room really blew it out of the water. His attention to detail was spot on, including many themes from the Prohibition era that I never would have thought of. Our cocktails were heavenly and refreshing and the fare was delightful. I especially recommend the strawberry French toast and Pittsburgh fries. The rooms were stunning. If you have a chance to book the General's room please do. I could live there. I couldn't stop staring at the details such as the cinematic wall paper and gorgeous pillows. I will definitely make the Taproom a staple in my social life! PS- Definitely check out their exclusive blend of Zeke's coffee. Best cup of coffee I have had in a really looong time.\n",
      "This is a lovely hotel that my colleague and I stay at whenever in town for work. I would say the hotel itself is a 4 star, but the people that work there are fabulous and push this up to a 5 for me. Today I had to pull some room statements from a few months ago, and Patrick was incredible. Very professional while juggling my call and guests checking in, patient and with a great sense of humor to top it off.\n",
      "Acting as the forgotten step brother to a superstar hotel a block away, the indigo shines where customer service, nice atmosphere, and cool digs are apparent. Again, exceptionally friendly front desk staff on all 3 days of my stay made this a memorable experience. If you find that the 'other' place down the street is booked (as I did) or too expensive, do not fret! You'll love it here. I did not try any food service so I can't comment I that.\n",
      "Fantastic place in a decent neighborhood, with lots of trendy bars and restaurants. Close to college campuses etc. Noah Sintic, someone working there, was very nice, and helped us learn about the local neighborhood. Any questions? He's your guy. Room was well decorated and extremely clean. And the bathroom was amazing haha. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Great hotel, friendly staff, comfy bed, great restaurant in the lobby. Would recommend to anyone!!!\n",
      "I have strong preference for Starwood properties out of an occupational addiction to SPG points, but I am very glad that I stayed here for a company function at Carnegie Mellon. A few reasons why this property stood out to me: - Echo other reviewers' positive sentiments about Jordan the manager. He was the first to greet me when I arrived, and consistently checked up on me regarding my needs (e.g., packages, billing) that I had told other staff members about. How he discovers and remembers details of so many individual residents escapes me, but it is truly amazing to experience personalized service akin to a small country B&B at a large corporate chain! - Secondly, a housekeeping staff named Tania periodically wrote (by hand) inspirational notes to me when she looked after my room. I have never experienced this level of thoughtfulness anywhere else, including Mandarin Oriental/St. Regis/Four Seasons/etc., which pride themselves on outstanding service... - I am quite picky about bed quality as it really affects sleep and thus health during extensive business travel, and I have to say...the bed was very comfortable. Mattress was just the right level of firmness, and they provide a very sumptuous five-layer sandwich of sheets, thin blanket, and down comforter. There are a few small things the property could improve upon, but it didn't take too much away from an overall excellent experience: there is no bathtub and housekeeping only provides 1 bottle of water per day (unless asked, I suppose). Some thoughts about the neighborhood: upon checking in you may get the impression that it is somewhat unsafe. Yes, there are pedestrians that look different from you and identify with a different income bracket. Yes, if you wake up early enough, you will find that people line up in front of the county assistance center and dollar store down the block. But this is real life for many in Pittsburgh...and should you run into someone coming out of either establishment while exploring on foot, chances are that person feels a lot more discomfort wondering why he or she has to pick up food stamps while others can saunter out of boutique hotels, than you do for the mere inconvenience of undesirable scenery. So should this happen to you, I encourage you smile, nod hello, wish him or her strength and courage for going about what must be another challenging day, and feel thankful that you are privileged enough in this broken world to stay in such a lovely property!\n",
      "After a poor overnight experience at their nearby 'hipster' themed competitor over the holidays, when we were back in town decided to stay here as we wanted to still stay in the same area. Overall, when we are back in Pittsburgh (~10-15 hotel nights/year, there) we will be coming back to Indigo as opposed to the aforementioned over-priced pretentious competitor and the more corporate competitor that is also nearby. Indigo seems to be the best combination of value, location & experience. The rooms were sizeable, well-appointed and functional. The shower was sizeable and super. Bed was very comfortable. I went to high school back in the day not far from here and this neighborhood is much safer that it used to be. We had a car but walked all over the place....Zeke's, Social, Mad Mex, EastSide, Union Pig & Chicken, etc. Granted it was mid-week in April but the hotel was very pleasant and quiet. The external noise was much much less noticeable than the competition up the block (where we also stayed on the 5th floor). Everyone working there was quite pleasant. At breakfast the manager stopped by each morning to make some kind, not forced small talk. The only knock that takes it down from 5 stars is the valet parking. Not worth $24/night for a few reasons. - This is an appropriate rate for closed/secure parking in areas where parking density is an issue. - If you came back to the hotel after 11PM, the valet was off for the night and you parked yourself. - Parking was one of 2 places; 1) directly across from the entrance, 20 feet away. It just made more sense for the valet to hand me the key and I walk over and pull myself out of the spot as opposed to watching them run over and do a quarter loop around the block to orient the car in the driveway. 2) in a surface lot around the corner. If you use the Pgh Parking Authority app, you could park in the same open lot for 1/2 the price. - Basically, I ended up parking/pulling out myself due to valet availability and/or common sense 80%+ of the time. The parking is not really in a secure, closed area. If you are not one of the first 10 cars in, directly across from the front door, your car is in a lot no more secure than curb parking.\n",
      "Great looking hotel inside! Room was very clean & it was interesting to have a hotel room without carpeting (assuming due to pets) I love that they accept pets of any size. Plenty of street parking so save on the valet. Although, the area is \"up & coming\" if you were traveling as a single woman as I was - use the valet if you can not find a close spot at night. I did not feel comfortable to walk the streets alone at night. But, sitting in the hotel bar was just fine. Employees were not overly friendly except for the gentleman in the vest I encountered at the front desk (sorry, forgot your name) & the gentleman working the bar in the hotel (newer to the bar, sorry I accidentally threw out my receipt with your name). No one else really interacted or they seemed worn. I was there for 3 days and I have to say I do not have any complaints! Bed was super comfy & the shower was amazing!!!\n",
      "Had a good stay, front desk was rude at times with a few confusing situations with check-in and the shuttle service/uber reimbursement , but overall it was a great hotel to stay in a great location.\n",
      "All the hotels in the area were booked for the Steelers game and it was looking like a lost cause until I found this gem! Recently opened this week-- this is literally 2 blocks away from my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh (Spoon and BRGR). They still are not 100% open yet-- as the gym is still under construction but they'll take you to the gym down the street. Staff is very attentive and customer focused. Decor is beautiful and very colorful! In my room, there was a zebra rug and a lamp that I initially thought was a telescope. Very beautiful rooms! Entire property is non-smoking as well. Make sure to check out the lobby floor as it has the three rivers depicted on the floor. For those visiting Pittsburgh, they have an interactive map with places to eat and visit :)\n",
      "WARNING - A Nice Hotel Stay Ruined By An Obnoxious Price Gouge - WARNING This is a converted Holiday Inn, made all sleek and modern. The public areas were very nice and either new or well maintained. The lobby was so modern, it seemed somewhat lacking in utility - and chairs - and there was an overpowering air freshener scent that hit you in the face when you walked in the front door. The rooms were very modern. The bathrooms were huge, with granite floors, which were slippery, and huge (6' X 8') glass showers. That was cool but, with one rain showerhead, most of it was completely wasted space. The rest of the room suffered in size for the enormous bathroom. In a room with two queen beds, there were only two chairs, and no table. There were only a couple of drawers in the long modern dresser/desk thing down one wall. There were only two plugs behind the nightstand, with a clock radio and phone already plugged in, so you couldn't charge phones next to the bed. I forgot my power strip. The floors were wood/laminate. Altogether, the room tried to be modern and sacrificed function and comfort to do so. Everything was very clean. We did not have time to try most of the amenities or the bar and restaurant. I got the impression that the place was pretty empty. The reason for the terrible review, rather than good though is that there is no self-parking! They have a lot, but it is valet parking only at a cost of $24.00 per day ($35.00 for large vehicles). This is not in the city center. They could simply charge a reasonable amount for parking. This is simply a way to have a lower price in online reservations systems and still squeeze a whole lot of money out of unsuspecting guests. No sir, if you mislead guests on their true costs, you get one star!\n",
      "We loved this hotel! The customer service was outstanding. The decor of hotel was comfortable and Art Deco. The manager and his team offered us the best customer service at all times. We loved our room. It was so comfortable and big the bed was very comfortable. It was my boyfriends birthday and they had something left in the room for him every night of our stay. It was wonderful. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "This review would have been 5 stars because the room was stylish, spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom featured a huge spa-like luxurious shower. The staff was approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable about the neighborhood. Room service was prompt and the food delicious. However, the reason we needed to use room service was that the private party in the restaurant/bar area was playing such loud music and partying. It was impossible to even have a conversation in the public areas of the hotel since it felt like being in a nightclub!\n",
      "Cool hotel near Penn Ave in East Liberty. I attended an event here, Yelp's Makers and and just loved the layout. I am such a fan of great lighting, and when you walk in, it's pretty well lit. It reminds me of a hotel in Paris, but in Pittsburgh. Who doesn't want to walk in a place and imagine you are in a different country? They have a restaurant on the lower level that I was able to try out, the Wallace Tap Room. It was good and inexpensive. They have valet parking, but I chose to park on the street. It was an event after 6, so you should be able to find a parking space on the street then. If you want to host a nice event on the east side of the city, they have ample space and rooms. Be sure to go and check it out.\n",
      "We haven't been to the East Liberty area in a while. It was a pleasant surprise to find this gem. We found the staff to be pleasant and knowledgable. The rooms are generous in size. Everything was clean and new. Some have complained about the valet parking situation. I would invite them to consider the positive impact that providing jobs for local youth has on the area which has been traditionally depressed. We will definitely return to the Hotel Indigo next time we are in Pittsburgh. We wish them nothing but the best!\n",
      "Looks are deceiving, everything is cheaply made. No refrigerator. Hair on the shower floor (gross)! The valet workers all seem tired and not too helpful. Pro was that it was a specious room and good location. Rather pay a little more for Ace hotel down the block.\n",
      "Brand spanking new hotel with fantastic service from the parking valets when you first arrive to the front desk and most importantly, the bar. One of the best features are the coffee shops, bars, and eateries within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. I stayed here as I have family in The Burgh and will make this my go to hotel when in the area\n",
      "The hotel exceeded my expectations. The neighborhood, while not aesthetically cute, is safe with some major restaurants and businesses nearby. Highland Park is close where we could walk our dog. We were close to the children's hospital, where we needed to go. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating (Patrick and Kenny in particular). The rooms were spacious, modern, and CLEAN. Don't be deterred by the location. There are good restaurants and a cafe nearby, not to mention Anthropologie was just a short driving distance away. The staff were very open to pets. Our pup was very happy staying here.\n",
      "I absolutely enjoyed my stay here at Hotel Indigo, our reunion host hotel. I appreciate the wonderful service and hospitality (i.e. front desk staff, valet, restaurant, housekeeping) that we received during our weekend stay, truly accommodating and the rooms are gorgeous and offer a very modern feel. Will definitely visit again!\n",
      "We had dinner at Wallace's tap room located in Hotel Indigo and it was great ! Not only was the food good but the ambience was really nice, they have some really nice intimate pillowed booths that were really comfortable. Our service was fab too, our waitress Tori was very informative and accommodating. We just looked at the hotel rooms when we were down with dinner and they were beautiful. We definitely eat at again and will suggest their hotel for out of town guests.\n",
      "Wonderful hotel for the price! Nicely appointed, and professional and friendly staff. We were in town for my daughter's birthday, and the staff all wished her a happy birthday and greeted her with balloons and candy. Breakfast was delicious. Couldn't have been better!\n",
      "What can I say about this hotel to give you an idea about how awesome it actually is? I love hotels and love to see what they have to offer. I'm a major fan of boutique hotels and have enjoyed my stays at the Hotel Monaco (more downtown and swanky). However, there is something different about Hotel Indigo. Hotel indigo is a vibrant and down to earth property. The decor is gorgeous for a romantic stay-cation and comfy and casual for a long stay. The rooms are spacious for the area and the neighborhood has a lot to offer (if you know where to look). However, don't worry! Patrick and Veronica at the front desk can point you in the right direction. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for his birthday (we're both local to Pittsburgh). We were warmly welcomed by the 2 lovely people earlier mentioned. They were so accommodating and the management (Jordan Bartels) along with the front desk helped me surprise my husband with his Birthday gift by placing it in our room before check in. Who does that? Amazing. After we got to our room, Patrick brought my husband a mason jar of nostalgic candy and a birthday balloon! Stephanie was our server at Wallace's taproom who was sweet and helpful. We had delicious cocktails at the bar made by a bubbly and talented bartender named Cat. Then to top it off, the bar manager Ashley chatted with us for a while and made us feel like home. To top off our stay, we slept comfortably in our soft bed and never heard a peep from the hustle and bustle of East Liberty. To sum up my review for this hotel, all I really need to say is , \"When can I stay again?\"\n",
      "A bit torn here. I think if I had stayed over a less hectic weekend, I could easily envision another star. Instead, I was here over Carnegie Mellon graduation and they were clearly overwhelmed. First of all, the room was beautiful. Modern and well appointed with a huge shower complete with waterfall rain head and hand held wand. What I wasn't crazy about was the view which, especially when paying well over $350 night surge rate, should have been explained. Our panoramic window revealed a brick wall and a large A/C duct. Was almost laughable. Okay, I actually did laugh. No big deal. Rest of the hotel was modern, clean, well appointed and visually striking. What was a big deal was that the restaurant, bar and valet staff were over stressed and service floundered. Everything from getting our car from the valet ($25/night) to getting a drink was tedious and that's putting it kindly. I understand a hotel's practice of jacking rates through the ceiling during the busiest times. This is to be expected. But along with the bump in price, needs to be a bump in service and clearly, last weekend it just wasn't there. Also, worth mentioning, is the crater sized pothole directly in front of the driveway that I needed to navigate my M6 through in order to avoid literally destroying the car's wheels and suspension. I don't know if it's the hotel's road or if it belongs to the city but, for God's sake, fix the damn thing. It's dangerous and an eyesore. None of this, however, would prevent me from staying there again as nothing was all that egregious. It was more like inconvenience which, as aforementioned, shouldn't have been a issue considering how much I was paying for the weekend ($627 just for room and parking for 2 nights). It's certainly a few steps above the local Hampton Inn and the plethora of other chains in the area.\n",
      "This place was great! I was in town to visit Carnegie Mellon and needed a hotel in the area. I found this place was the same price as the nearby Hampton Inn and decided to give it a try. The room was great! Bed was comfy, shower was large, and front desk staff were very helpful. Booking and checking in were very easy. If you need a shuttle to/from PIT, there isn't one available. I didn't rent a car while I was in town, but I found transportation pretty easy. Hotel was near several bus lines and I didn't have a problem getting an Uber. The neighborhood is definitely...in transition, but it felt pretty safe. Area was walkable and there were enough places to eat in the area. There is also a new Target in walking distance if you happen to leave your entire toiletry bag at home like I did.\n",
      "I attend the Yelp Pittsburgh Makers and Bakers event. The hotel is located right in the main part of East Liberty. It is in walking distance to many restaurants. I didn't see the rooms but the event space was spacious and was able to hold this large event well. The decor is new and fresh. Check out their restaurant on the first floor. Really good food.\n",
      "Pros: This place is in a great place! It's in an area that is walking distance to Target, CVS and lots of restaurants. This neighborhood is currently being developed so it's not like staying in Shadyside or some of the nicer parts but it's safe. The staff in incredibly friendly & the decor is so awesome & modern. The entire hotel is super clean. Con: I only have 1--the shower. I think that my room is being remodeled and they are almost done but didn't want to miss out on money so; they allowed the room to be occupied. My shower floor was covered with mildew--it's gross. I have shower shoes; so I braved it & I had already unpacked and It was late so I stayed in the room. I will stay here again BUT only after I check to see if the shower floor is covered in mildew lol. I'll post pictures so you can decide what's best for yo\n",
      "Very friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful hotel and rooms. Good coffee . The reason for four stars is that it is not in the best part of town. The area is revitalizing but is not there yet. I would not suggest parking far from the hotel or walking alone at night.\n",
      "I've stayed here twice and very pleased both times. Everybody was very nice. The place was decorated nice and I loved my room. We ate in the restaurant quite a lot and it was pretty good and had a good happy hour and the folks in there were the nicest of all. The room had a Great view, great shower, and my bed was super comfy! And super reasonable price! Get the parking package online for $5 and save a ton on parking.\n",
      "Just stayed at Hotel Indigo for 5 nights. The room was fantastic; spacious, modern and nicely decorated. The bed was amazing! Nice and firm making for a wonderful nights sleep. Loved the iHome bedside radio with bluetooth. The bath was modern and spacious, and loved the Aveda bath products. In room coffee maker was a nice touch, although in general I think Keuring coffee cups are a environmental disaster. Only, and very minor complaint was uneven housekeeping. Not leaving coffee and coffee condiments each day, so had to ask front desk, which they happily provided. I would definitely stay here again. I loved the diversity of the neighborhood, the proximity to bus service and local eateries. A very walkable neighborhood.\n",
      "If I could give this zero stars I would. We were staying here for our wedding reception. The first moment I tried to check in and was told they couldn't find our reservation. We were told to just \"stay at home since we lived in the area\". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago. Next, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can't make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude. Lastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving. Overall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you work in the hospitality business, you should NOT be rude, sarcastic and cold to your patrons, which was especially horrible considering the event. I will never stay at a hotel indigo again.\n",
      "My husband and I had the opportunity to stay at this wonderful hotel for our anniversary. What an incredible hotel. Loved the trendy decor. Our check in was quick and easy. The room had a large shower with a wonderful waterfall shower head. Plenty of counter space in the bathroom area. Bed was very comfortable. Very nice hotel. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.\n",
      "Silly lead, Mr Potts, kept playing with his hair. Otherwise a great place to spend an evening.\n",
      "What a GREAT SURPRISE! I wasn't sure if I was gonna enjoy this performance. Admittedly, wasn't my favorite movie... I enjoyed every second of the AMAZING talent on stage! All I can say is, \"Don't miss this one, your gonna be singing the tunes all the way home\"!\n",
      "First time here this summer. I wasn't even aware of this place if not from fellow yelpers. I could not believe it's been around for 40 years! We've seen the production of \"Bye Bye Birdie\", \"Tarzan the Musical\" and \"Lend Me A Tenor\" this summer 2015. I watched them with family and friends and everyone had a great time. The plays, the sets, the actors were fabulous. We pack picnic baskets and eat here while people watching and enjoying the scenery before the shows. We love the idea of watching plays under the stars. (Make sure to bring sweaters as it could get cold at night) Highly recommended and will definitely be back next season!\n",
      "The live performing arts is something I did not fully appreciate until after I was grown. I've been to a few plays over the years. Some high budget shows at well known and respected venues. Some were smaller productions at local play houses. Never had I been to a play at an outdoor venue. That is until I went out to Super Summer Theatre earlier this summer. I went to see Bye Bye Birdie. I had heard of it before I went though I had never seen any of the film or theatre productions previously. I knew that it would be about a 1950's era rock'n'roll star so I was not the least bit surprised to hear the early rock hits of the late 50s and early 60s playing before the show. I was rocking out like nobodies business despite my young(er) age. I love that music. Anyhow, I knew I would be having fun when the show got going. I did have fun though I don't think I spent much time watching the show. Being outside under the stars was a distraction. I am a bit of a sky watcher and living in the city I don't often get to see so many stars. Spring Mountain Ranch, where Super Summer Theatre is housed, is away from all the city lights and therefore provides amazing star viewing opportunites. I almost didn't even recognize the sky. I did know what I was looking at when I saw at least three satellites passing over head. That was cool. This scenery was my big take away from the night. The ranch is nestled against the mountains which, with a setting sun behind them, create some magnificant shadows. They also keep the night air crisp and cool. I was glad there were a few food trucks around so I could get a hot cup of tea and warm me up. Sitting on the lawn and taking in the fresh air while sipping on a cup of Earl Grey was a nice way to spend the evening. It was almost relaxing. Had it not been for the hundreds of bats zipping around and buzzing my head I would have been happy as a clam. I appreciate bats and like to see them from afar. But I don't want to hear the wind coming off their wings as they swoop my head. Eek. Other than that and the constant smell of burro poop, this is an awesome venue and a great place to catch a good show.\n",
      "Great evening for all ages. Rent a low chair for $1 worth it! The performances are top notch. Great sound and lighting. Bring your dinner, favorite drink blankets and it a perfect date or family outing.\n",
      "I don't know why it took me 10 years to come back out here, I forgot how much fun we have! This is yet another reason I love Vegas, there is so much to do off the Strip, and for those people who complain there isn't anything to do here, well here you go. I'm not gonna lie, I didn't watch either show we came to see (sorry, hopped on the booze train), I think the first play I saw was Rent, and most recently was Spamalot. This is an excuse to get all your friends together, eat, drink, picnic and socialize. They split the grassy knoll into two sections, one for people with high chairs, and the other side is people with low back chairs and blankets. I like to seat near the back of the grassy area so we can chat during the show and not disturb people, also there is no rush for us to get there two hours before the show starts to get prime seats. Pack a blanket, beach chairs, and make a great picnic out of it. They allow alcohol! Bathrooms were clean, I didn't see a lot of bugs out, but I did spray bug spray before for good measure. They have a concession stand, as well as 1 or 2 \"food trucks\", a coffee truck was there yesterday. Temperature is awesome during the summertime.\n",
      "I love this place !!! Everything from plays to the weather to the staff !! Pack your picnic basket and b a bottle of wine or two (or whatever floats your boat). Get there early, sit back and enjoy. It's that simple !! oh btw Spam-a-lot was fantastic !! Thank you Super Summer Theatre !!\n",
      "We went last night to see Ain't Misbehavin'. The show was very well performed by a cast of 5. The band and piano player were superb also. I'm looking forward to seeing Damn Yankees next month. It was a pleasant moonlit evening. This is what makes Super Summer Theatre special. I always enjoy their productions.\n",
      "Current production of CRAZY FOR YOU is just the best. We went back a second night to see it again. That good. We took our picknick dinner and enjoyed wonderful evenings. Casting - choriography - music - jokes were all super.\n",
      "Super Summer Theater has been providing Las Vegas with outdoor entertainment for 39 Seasons. Located at the foothills in Spring Mountain Ranch State Park the theater provides relief from the heat in the valley. Currently playing is Spamalot which is a rendition of the motion picture Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Prior to the show we find King Arthur and Patsy making the rounds through the audience for photo opportunities. Throughout, the cast shows energy and enthusiasm. The sound and lighting systems worked perfectly. Kudos to Sandra Huntsman (Lady of the Lake) for her beautiful voice. Overall it's an entertaining show for all ages. The affordable price maintained with the help of volunteers and donations makes Super Summer Theater a great family outing. Arrive early, bring picnic food, blanket or chair and enjoy the show. As an option you can purchase food and rent a chair. Unlike many other events exiting the parking lot is quick due to the traffic control provided by several police officers.\n",
      "This is definitely a hometown Vegas attraction. I've been out here tons of times and it gets better every time. In a town where people barely know their neighbors, it's amazing that I can't come up here without bumping into friends from all over the valley. You have to get out there early (doors open at 6pm for an 8:30pm show) to get a good spot. Two sides of the lawn allow for tall chairs on one side and low chairs and blanket seating on the other. Folks love to bring out their picnics (wine bottles allowed!) and enjoy eating and visiting while we wait for the sun to go down and the show to start. I recommend a cooler that can be carried by two or that has large wheels for rolling over rocky terrain. The evening starts out warm as the sun sets (hello, it's the desert!) but cools down nicely by show time. Shows start late which makes it hard for little ones. My 5 year old was snoozing 5 minutes after Beauty and the Beast started. For a small community theater, the talent is amazing and the show quality top notch. Outside of one show that was more depressing than I expected (I had no idea what the show was about beforehand), I have never ever been disappointed! If you are a resident looking for a real hometown, family friendly attraction, then Super Summer Theatre is a must!\n",
      "The park is beautiful, the plays are well rehearsed and well performed and the atmosphere is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas strip. A must do item that should be on everyone's list of things to do in Las Vegas. I had a large party (11) going to see a play @ Spring Mountain Ranch put on by SST and had family coming in from Ohio who had no idea how warm it gets during the day. Once the day had started, it was quickly realized that 112* in Las Vegas meant 100* at the ranch. My brother -in-Law suffers from a condition called syncope, which can lead to a sudden and extreme loss of blood pressure and cause the subject to faint and require emergency medical attention. This condition is often brought on by over heating among other things. Although the tickets say no refunds or exchanges, I reached out to \"Bryan\" and called him on his cell phone to ask what could be done. Due to the fact that the tickets were in excess of $180, and that I called hours before the play started, and that it was a sold out show with many at the gate wanting access, Bryan agreed to allow me to exchange the tickets for the afternoon play in October. If all businesses treated the customers with such care and empathy, the world would be a much better place. Congratulations for a job well done! #customerforlife\n",
      "Why wait? Buy your tickets, pack a picnic, and get goin.' When it's hot in Vegas, the grassy lawn at Spring Mountain will cool you down. We meet up with several couples a few hours before plays begin to watch the sun go down behind Red Rock. Each couple brings a course and we share dinner together. I like the sunset, wine and conversation the most. I usually fall asleep shortly after dinner, not because the plays are uninteresting, but who wouldn't fall asleep after drinking wine then laying down under the stars? I plan to buy a short chair for next summer. Sitting upright should help. In my view the actors and musicians are talented. Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory was fun. My favorite play was The Buddy Holly Story in the summer of '09. The music was amazing. For a few hours on Saturday nights in the summer I feel grounded and connected--thankful for my friends and the gorgeous landscape that surrounds us.\n",
      "Went last night with so friends to see Memphis. I was so surprised what a great venue this was. I am a season ticket holder for the Broadway Series at the Smith Center and I would say the rival each other for different reasons. The stage was very impressive. The set was fantastic and way more detailed than expected. I was also impressed by the lighting, sound and counties. The talent was also very, very good. I love that this is an outdoor space. You sit surrounded by the cliffs and mountains of Red Rock Park. Absolutely stunning. The sitting area is shaded so even though the sun is still up as you arrive if you are going to get a seat and plan to picnic, you'll find a shady place for your group. This is a great event for families. The lawn in front of the stage is grass with 2 sections. One side is for Chris with legs and one is for blankets with the option of chairs without legs. You can bring blankets and stadium pads with back rests ( the kind with no legs) or the rent plastic white patio chairs with the legs cut off. You can bring food and drinks in including your own alcohol. The do have some concessions. I didn't check this out as we brought a picnic but I saw pizza, ice cream treats and snow cones.\n",
      "This is the 38th year for SST, and I'm surprised how many people don't seem to know about it. That's good, I guess, because it's crowded enough already. We've been going here every summer for years. It's one of my favorite activities because it's a nice drive outside the city, it's always cool and pleasant in the meadow, the crowd tends to be older, mellow, and appreciative, and the productions are surprisingly good, especially the ones put on by PS Productions. They always seem to be superior. My fave, though, is that you get to bring in your own food and beverages (including alcohol), no searches, hassles, or pressures to buy their wares. BUT, if you get a late start or decide to go at the last minute, they do have a snack bar with hot dog, nachos, popcorn, candy, etc., - your basic movie theater food, but at reasonable prices; like a dollar for a soda and 2 bucks for a big hot dog. Only complaint is that tonight, for the first time in my experience, they used recorded music. Hope this won't be a trend as live music has always been part of the charm. Oh, yes- don't get in a fight with your BF and leave him home because then you and your friend will have to drag the chairs and the ice chest down to the meadow and all the way back by yourselves instead of having him drop you off near the entrance and haul all the crap for you. Sometimes we just don't think things through.\n",
      "I have been to the Super Summer Theater about 4-5 times and have seen such productions as \"Tom Sawyer,\" \"Noises Off,\" \"Aria,\" and my favorite musical, \"1776.\" The quality of these productions are surprisingly good, and the price (I think it's $10 in advance and $15 at the door) are more than reasonable. It's a great value. Plus, you can bring your own food and drink to the production- no more spending $5 for a hot dog or $7 for a beer! I highly recommend going out to Red Rock to catch any production you have the chance to, this theater production is well worth the effort to see!\n",
      "I recently went SST with my family. The entertainment was great and the atmosphere was great, but the (volunteer) workers were not. Some of them were absolutely rude. As we were parking (for one of the shows) we witnessed an interaction between a person with disabilities and a volunteer worker. The volunteer worker was screaming at the person with disabilities. It was degrading and so unnecessary. It scared my kid. I felt bad for the person with disabilities. As a result of this experience my kids and I no longer want to go. I think next season I will support something else.\n",
      "Perfect day...not too much sun and a little breeze...for a musical in the park! Can't wait for bye bye birdie...love the doo wop music is the 50s\n",
      "We were invited by another couple for a night out. It's been years since I've attended a play at the Spring Mountain Ranch State Park. So I thought ok, why not!?! Well WHY NOT indeed! I forgot how well kept and pretty the meadow is. All the staff/volunteers we encountered were very nice, even though it was hot as heck the evening we attended. Not sure how they keep smiling while they stand for hours in the blazing sun, but they do it with grace. Parking was well organized and they keep the cars moving pretty quickly. The play of the night was \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\". A really hard show to pull off, considering it requires a flying car and two of the main characters are young kids. The Baron and Baroness were absolutely hysterical and had the crowd laughing every time they came out on stage! The actor and actress played so well off one another and made a fantastic team. If you haven't come to a play yet, I strongly suggest you pack a blanket and great picnic and make a night of it.\n",
      "A local hidden jewel for summer entertainment. I've been coming here with my friends and family for years now and it is something we look forward to attending every year! If your looking for ambiance, cooler weather and making memories this is worth trying. It's romantic for couples-bring the wine, it's great to bring the friends and fam-share your snacks or have a small potluck. The theater is sometimes Fantastic and some times it's a yawner but if you go with an open mind you will be pleasantly surprised. A few of my favorites over the years was Fiddler on the Roof, Beauty and the Beast and my all time fav Annie-best bonding time with my daughter! Just saw Oliver on Saturday and had a hard time following however the most amazing lightning show made it all worth it. ;)\n",
      "I hate to be giving so many 5 stars but luck seems to be going my way lately. Get there early! It is first come, first get seating. Bring a picnic or they do have honey backed ham sandwiches for sale. Picnics are more fun. Before the play we walked around and saw the donkeys. Bring a camera. I would like to go back when you can tour the old ranch house. Everything was very organized, clean and comfy. I am going back for the other shows later this summer.\n",
      "For only $12, a couple of my friends and I got to enjoy a lively production of Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and have a picnic while we were at it. This was the first outdoor production I ever saw and it was an amazing sight to see people huddled all around us with their families, enjoying wine and picnicking. About 15 minutes before the show began, the band began to play classic rock songs (Don't Stop Believing by Journey, Highway Star by Deep Purple, Back In Black by ACDC) and invited people to go up on stage to sing along. We all had a blast and everyone was having the time of their lives. The production itself was well-worth the $12. The only downside to watching an outdoor production in the middle of summer is the rain, and sure enough, during the middle of the show, it started to pour. I was impressed by how the cast took it and the guy who played the pharaoh even managed to joke that we 'should be thankful it wasn't raining frogs.' Nonetheless, we stayed till the end of the show, all wrapped in our shawls and blankets. It was definitely an experience that garnered so many memories and I can't wait to watch next year's productions. Keep in mind to bring raincoats for the kids and easy storage for all your food. You may want to settle with bringing your own picnic blankets or else you could rent some chairs for $1 each. There's always something for each member of the family here so just make sure to come in with an open mind and a lot of enthusiasm and I promise you'll have a blast!\n",
      "This place deserves 10 stars. Amazing. This was my first time and I can't believe it has taken me so long to get out here. First I recommend getting there early because it fills up. There are basically two sides; one side is for people with chairs and the other is for blankets and chairs without legs (yes that's right, chairs without legs) We had about six of us spread out on 3 blankets. Two of my friends had cushion type chairs that were perfect, but the rest of us sat on pillows. I definitely think sitting on this side is preferred but would recommend bringing or renting a chair (they have them for $1) We brought wine & food, picnic style and it was perfect because we had just finished eating when the show was about to start. The setting and scenery is so nice that I can't imagine not having a good time out here. Tickets are only $12 if you buy them in advance. Legally Blonde was absolutely amazing. I was laughing the whole time. It was great!! Such a fun night out with friends. There's also a concession stand and one of my friends got a few bags of popcorn for our group. I think this place is ok for kids, depending on the show content. There seemed to be a fair amount of kids, but they seemed to be fairly well behaved. I can't wait to go back next month, for The Producers! *Be careful on the drive up, one of my friends got a ticket for speeding from one of the park rangers.\n",
      "Picnic baskets in tow, full of yummy snacks wine, and goodies... We went with some friends last night for the very first time. OMG!! It was such a fun night! I am already planning on the next show. This is absolutely be one of my Summer Theater activities from this day forward! We bought our tickets directly from Prestige Travel on W. Lake Mead. Even at this point, it was great. The staff there were so sweet and helpful. 8 of us headed in for an awesome night, rolled out our blankets and got settled in. Once the show started, I was shocked at how great the production values were. To be honest, I was expecting something on par with a good community theater. I WAS MISTAKEN!!! The show was fantastic, great voices, smart staging, and on point start to finish! Oh, I don't forget the pack of wild burros sauntering by! Las Vegas Magic for locals right here! ALL THIS for a $12. ticket?? That is right! Can you believe it???? I will probably not miss a single show Super Summer Theater show from this moment forward! WOW! What a treat!!\n",
      "Surprisingly good theater in the evening under the stars. The show started at 8 but the parking lot opened at 5. Was suggested to arrive early since had no tickets and it was the closing night of Beauty and the Beast. We weren't so well prepared for the long pre-show wait but most of those around us were. It's BYO-everything here. Had to rent chairs (only $1) but most brought their own. Some refreshments are available for purchase - sandwiches, fries, hot dogs, even pizza - but a big cooler and pot luck would make seeing a performance a great way to hang with friends for the entire evening. My only issue was the rather inconsistent seating guidelines. Some were (nicely) told where to align their chairs while others were pretty much allowed to do as they pleased.\n",
      "Had a great time. We have been here several times and each time has been a blast. We will definitely be back. Love that my BF is a board member, so we are luckily enough to get VIP privileges. Tonight, 'Memphis' was great. Former student at Palo Verde HS, Heather A. was wonderful and beautiful. So proud of her. Last play seen here was 'Beauty and the Beast', it was amazing!!!!! Also, while at the Spring Mtn State Park, I got PIKACHU on Pokemon Go!!!!!!\n",
      "My wife made the suggestion that we come up here last year, at first I wasn't super excided( normally local theatre is average at best). Last year we saw Beauty and the beast, and it was really good , the stage and sound quality is far above expectations. It was a well directed and organized production, just as good as some Broadway shows I have seen in the past. This year we went to the wedding singer, and the production was great, same quality show and overall organization. So now I have seen multiple shows and they both are great presentations. The quality of show really makes you feel like you in a high production show not sitting in a park eating a picnic. So the seating is first come first serve, I recommend getting there aroud 6 to 630. Bring a blanket and a picnic have some drinks. They normally have a good section of vendors selling fair stlye food for reasonable price. I do recommend renting one of the chairs that sit on the ground they are $1. The downside and the only downside if you ask me, the restroom situation is not nice ( as a guy I'm ok but the last 2 times my wife has had no tp and had to hover ( or that's what she calls it ) So by far one of the best vegas spots to watch a great show and have an awesome night out, its by far the best date night in Vegas. Also its extremely affordable, buy your tickets early they have a tendency to sell out!\n",
      "This is the perfect place to spend a nite out! I went to Super Summer Theatre for my first time last nite.... and I cannot wait to go back! I had a fabulous time hanging out and enjoying the show with friends. The weather was perfect! All of the staff there was so friendly and helpful! Just a great atmosphere, I am very much looking forward to going back!\n",
      "Went back to Super Summer Theatre for our first time in years and loved it! Truly a treat and just a great evening. Terrific performance. Affordable. Fun. Great scenery. We'll be back very soon. In fact, we plan to purchase tickets in advance for the entire season, since I hear some of the shows sell out. Next time we'll probably rent chairs there for $1 each rather than bringing our own.\n",
      "What a wonderful venue!! Shows are great. Tickets are affordable. No matter how hot it might be, by show time all seats are cool & in shade. It's the \"Hollywood Bowl\" of Vegas. Bring a picnic dinner or purchase food at the venue. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Oh Fiddler on the Roof. Coincidentally enough, it reminds me of the high school production I saw...and wait, is that the girl who was in my high school's rendition of Fiddler? Oh, yes it is! Something about being under the stars, escaping the deadly Vegas heat, and attempting to be more cultured has its charms. Watching this with my brother and Paolo D. turned out to be a great night. As for the performance, it reminded me a lot of high school - endearing in its effort. Though singing was spotty in some areas, the production itself was better than I had expected. The venue was perfect - gorgeous in its nearby rock formation (and on the night of our performance, imminent thunderstorms), cool enough to enjoy a true warm summer's night, and accommodating for an impromptu picnic. Only a half hour drive from the city and tickets costing about 15 dollars, I am in love with the Super Summer Theatre.\n",
      "I hate to let out the secret that this is the BEST kept secret in Vegas, but this place is amazing! This is my 5th visit and I am never disappointed. Where else in this town can you spend $25 and get great entertainment for 2. The views of the mountains are beautiful to boot. Bring your own food and drinks and a relaxed attitude. You can also bring blankets, chairs and pillows for a relaxed evening. Wine, food, entertainment, and with the right people, you have the makings for a great night!\n",
      "I give it a 5 star! It was their 39th season and we went to see Shrek The Musical, for it being an outdoor theater I didn't expect such great music, props, and actors. The play was funny and entertaining. You can bring a picnic basket, beverages even alcohol and a blanket and watch it underneath the stars.\n",
      "The moon started its journey, rising from behind an expansive tree, reaching onward to the middle of the sky as Super Summer Theater finished its last production of the year. I've been coming to Spring Mountain State Park for over 4 years to enjoy Super Summer Theater's open air productions. They vary from PG to PG-13ish musicals and plays. A gently sloping green meadow serves as the audience seating and you can locate yourself anywhere you want, but be willing to arrive here early to get your favorite spot...even though there is no bad seat since their sound system is quite nice. Getting from your car to the meadow is an easy stroll, thanks to the newly extended walkway. There are several food trucks at the back of the meadow, but most patrons prefer to bring their own favorite picnic items...or at least bring as much as you are willing to carry. Oh, and about drinks....no corkage fee, so bring a bottle or two of your favorite varietal. There are 6 coed restrooms, each with a sink, toilet paper and a air dryer and addition port-a-potty. The only part I didn't care for was that a few people were smoking in the open air and it spread around making it unpleasant for a lot of us. Super Summer Theater remains a fairly family oriented setting. When out of town visitors ask me what do I do in Vegas besides gambling. My response often includes the beautiful hiking trails, The Smith Center and Super Summer Theater....where we pay so little but receive such a rich blessing in return. Be sure to come with someone you want to cozy-up with since it gets cold in the early and late summer times. You may like to bring your blanket, wear thick socks and layer your clothing options, depending on the time of year. You can rent a chair for $1 if you're not bringing your picnic blanket. Tickets were $15.95 in advance and $20 at the door for the 2016 season. But keep in mind that it often sells out, so be sure to purchase ticket ahead of time. Come and breathe fresh air as you experience an amazing performance that the ticket price simply can not justify. You can check out their schedule at. http://supersummertheatre.org See you there!\n",
      "YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(218/365) \"Picnic and A Show In The Desert\" Now this is what its all about! I've heard alot about SST for years and we FINALLY got to spend a night out with Paolo and Jieun when we went to see Shrek. This is a perfect example of \"There's much more than the Strip\"... This is a great place to arrange a night out with family and friends to just have a great time. We went during the hot summer months, but didn't have to worry about baking in the heat because it was surprisingly cool the whole time we were there! There are two seating areas on the lawn-one half where chairs are allowed,(you can rent chairs there for $1) and another area which I personally prefer because you can bring low back chairs, or lay out a blanket picnic style. Pack your own picnic basket like we did with some cheeses, wine, sweets, and some beer and a couple bottles of wine, and you're good to go! If you're too lazy to do so, no worries, they have concession stands there as well. Shows do sell out, so grab your tickets fast or better yet, become a season ticketholder! The show was very fun and entertaining, but no photography or video is allowed during the show. If you haven't been here yet, I strongly suggest you do so with you family, friends, or significant other to the Super Summer Theatre! ALOHA!!! Shaka Meter: \\uuu/ \\uuu/ \\uuu/ \\uuu/ \\uuu/ 5\n",
      "This is such a perfect night out whether it is with family or friends. Even if the weather is 110 degrees that day, up at the park it is cool and perfect for watching the plays. You are allowed to bring your own food and drinks, even alcohol which is almost unheard of anywhere here in Vegas. I have been going since I was a child and am continuing the tradition now as an adult.\n",
      "I've been coming to this for a few summers now and it's been equally as fun each time. They always have great plays/musicals lined up. The latest is Bring It On: The Musical, which Hamilton's own Lin-Manuel Miranda actually helped create the lyrics & music for. How cool is that?! The theatre itself is outdoors, on a grassy field in the middle of the Red Rock area. But don't let that fool you. There's plenty of trees & wildlife buzzing about, it's like a little oasis! You can pay a few bucks to get yourself a chair to sit in, or you can bring a blanket & picnic dinner to enjoy during the show. Lots of folks bring food from places like KFC or Cafe Rio, but there's also several pop-ups where you can purchase snacks like funnel cake, popcorn, snow cones, etc. Just a heads up: Most of those places are CASH ONLY! but very tasty. Parking is very organized, thanks to volunteers. Prepare to present tickets at the entrance, but don't fret about time too much. Last time, I showed up minutes before showtime but was still able to see perfectly from the back of the picnic area.\n",
      "I went with David and Diana S to catch Fiddler on the Roof last night. I didn't expect a lot and I really don't know anything about FotR, but I found their production to be quite good. Sure, some of the singing was a little lacking. That's being way too nitpicky, though. To me, a solid lead can really set a show apart. I'm happy to report that the guy who played Tevye was outstanding--full of charisma and stage presence. I highly recommend catching one of their shows. Any show really. Worst case, you spend $15 for a ticket and get to escape the valley heat for an evening under the stars. That's worth the price of admission alone. I went simple--cheap brie and wine. Just don't forget your bottle opener.\n",
      "Beautiful meadow, quality and fun musical productions, inexpensive tickets, the amazing natural beauty of red rock, picnic with friends, and did I mention the BYOB? Super Summer Theatre is the best! First off, I wish we had gotten their earlier, but it was a quick trip to vegas with this fun excursion. Next time... You pack along a picnic, some of your favorite beer, wine, whatever, and you lay out a blanket in the sunshine. What could be better!? Well how about as that sun starts setting you get to enjoy a quality musical- we went to see Spamalot! We're not talking broadway quality, but its not community theater quality either! I was very impressed with the show's production and the caliber of the performance and for only $12.95 a ticket! Super Summer Theatre- keep it up! I am very excited to come back to town (Vegas) and get away from all that is blah about the city (the Strip) and enjoy another evening with you!\n",
      "Love this $12.00 excuse to get out of the heat, picnic under the stars in a quaint natural amphitheater and enjoy some great live performances! We always have some spare cash with us to drop into \"the hat\" for the maintenance and upkeep of this gem in our midst. Even if you pay full ticket price at the door of $20.00, it's a bargain. Saw The Music Man and Legally Blonde this season with the latter being one of the best shows I've seen here over the past few years. Super fun, super beautiful setting in the park, super easy parking and really friendly volunteer staff. GO!\n",
      "Independent theater productions in Vegas...I know its hard to fathom but yes...it surprisingly does take place in between the chaotic walls of this city of mayhem we live in! What's also hard to believe is the fact that it has been around for 33 years and I did not have a clue! I am a huge fan of the performing arts and have always tired to support local theater groups in every single place I have lived and this is one spot that will help continue that tradition. Super Summer Theater is a great way to escape, relax and visually stimulate that right side of the brain (and for all you dirty-minded people out there this stimulation does not include ladies who are wrapped around a pole). Located at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park, the theater is nestled among the beautiful red rock mountains that hold a spectacular and serene view. Every summer they feature 3 classic American plays/musicals that run for one month each. The best aspect of this theater is that it is an outdoor theater. They encourage people of all ages to come out with their blankets and picnic food/equipment to supplement their experience...and if you ask me the best way to add to that is with a bottle of wine...or maybe two! Just when you thought Vegas was nothing but casinos, clubs and stripper poles...Super Summer Theater is proof that culture does actually and thankfully exist here.\n",
      "Awesome venue on a summer night! Great group or date night location. Getting out of the parking lot was a lot smoother than expected. Wish the snack shack stayed open longer but you can bring your own food, drinks, blankets.\n",
      "One of our FAVORITE family traditions! The productions are excellent quality, the setting is so beautiful it almost seems unreal! We love bringing a picnic and wine and enjoying the cooler temps during a pre show dinner. Spread out a blanket and snuggle my little ones year after year. I am so thankful for the volunteers that make this happen each year! The prices are shockingly low for a great night out!\n",
      "Love this place and plan on performing on the stage come 2017 ( fingers crossed ). Family fun and picnic time with some cooler weather down in Blue Diamond. Such a nice getaway and easy to create lasting memories with the ones you love! Come every year and still have nothing bad at all to say, especially because the staff and employees there are soooooo sweet! Checkout the 2017 season and get your tickets ahead of time!\n",
      "So much talk about going to one of the show had lead me to seeing no shows and close to missing out on a good performance. Once you turn off to Blue Diamond heading towards Bonnie Springs, the temperature automatically drops by ten degrees. Sitting outside in a comfortable 85-90 degrees under the stars will quickly put most things back into perspective. Add some family, friends, a picnic, a fun show, and you have a wonderful time. I saw Fiddler on the Roof with my sister and Paolo D. Even though one of us didn't know what the play was about before going, it was easy enough to follow... most of the time. The singing was good... most of the time. The unique enjoyment of watching the sunset right before the play was amazing... always. My only complaint is that my friend called a few days before the production and they told her that it was sold out. When we got there, there was a stand to buy tickets. With discrepancies like this, more than eight people couldn't go. I also learned that night that your meal is only limited to your imagination. People were bringing in anything and everything.\n",
      "I can vaguely remember in the my youth rolling out to Vista and watching summer theater in a park. It was neat to see a community come together in peace and enjoy a play. Fast forward decades later, and I finally got to enjoy theater in all place in the desert, but in the shadows of beautiful Red Rock at the equally beautiful Spring Mountain Ranch State Park! Which if memory serves....the SST has apparently also been around for decades. The GF, Boy and I met up with the Boy's GF's family after purchasing tickets for \"Arsenic and Lace.\" The play is a wonderful adaptation of a surprisingly dark comedy originally from the early 1940's starring Cary Grant. The location is many degrees cooler than anywhere in the Vegas Valley. Entry was without problems, despite the other party having the tickets. We were directed to a holding area until they arrived. When we rolled in...the parking was professionally administered by staff. The venue is small and somewhat intimate. We rented chairs for a buck and sat the right side of the venue. I am not sure, but this seemed to be where a majority of the seat sitters were located. The left side, appeared to be for those just lazing on the grass. I believe wherever you would sit, would be sufficient to enjoy the show. That is...unless your sitting behind someone with an enormous melon. Being over six feet tall, who would have thought I would be bobbing and dodging around a colossal cranium trying to take the stage in. I took the hit so others in the party did not have to. Thank you MM for offering! We brought several coolers containing fixtures for sandwiches, wine, and sweets. There is concessions but I can not vouch for them. The stage craft was detailed and in keeping with the performance. The sound system was perfect. At the end of the performance there is a mass exodus. We chose to chill in the lot, watching others fight the crowd, while watching a lightning show somewhere in Arizona. SST is a treat. A local gem everyone should experience. I can't wait to visit and enjoy it again someday.\n",
      "Attended the last showing of Beauty and the Beast on June 18, 2016. We were visiting from Hawaii and just so happened to see the sign for the show when visiting Spring Mountain State Park. I love Beauty and the Beast. The type that will watch the Disney movie over and over AND sing along to every song. We called and looked online for tickets but sadly they were sold out. Luckily we were told that we could purchase tickets at the gate ($20.00 per person at the gate). Yelp reviews helped us a lot to make sure we arrived early (by 5:30pm) to purchase tickets. When we arrived the line to get in was already snaking around the parking lot. Though it wasn't fun standing in line waiting for the gates to open it was amazing to see how many people had gone to watch the play. When we got in, we rented $1.00 chairs to sit on and found seats fairly close to the front. The volunteers however weren't very helpful and were scolding certain groups of people for taking up too much space and not others. I think we could have gotten close seats we were told and just went around and in front of people. The show itself was AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. The set was amazing, the actors was amazing, and omg the singing! I was in Beauty and the Beast heaven. The princess in me went crazy and I am so happy I was able to attend and watch this play. I wish I could attend more but this was only my second time to Nevada and I don't have any plans of returning any time soon. Nevada natives, if you haven't been to Super Summer Theater you definitely should. Bring your family, food, alcohol, and extra cash to purchase some of the yummy food they offered. They also have bathrooms which are pretty nice but the lines get really long.\n",
      "I went to the first performance of the \"Super Summer Theater\", it was supposed to be a show featuring a variety of different songs from Broadway Musicals. However, they completely changed the rhythm and the tone of the songs to the point that they were no longer even recognizable, ruining classics like the King & I, Oklahoma, The Sound of Music, etc. It was so bad that by the time it was over the majority of people had already left. Keep your money I want the 90 minutes of my life that you stole back!!!\n",
      "Make sure to come early, pack a blanket and picnic. The show starts when the sun sets. Parking is much easier if you get there early. They do have snacks if you don't mind ball park style foods. The shows are high quality. The actors, singers, and dancers do an amazing job of bringing it all to life!\n",
      "One of the best kept secrets out in Las Vegas. We went with a group and brought food, drinks, and snacks. All I knew was it was a outdoor play, by the mountains. And the view was spectacular, the weather was like 15* degrees cooler than in the city. We went at sunset practically it was perfect. They had chairs to rent and a few small vendors for things to buy if you didn't bring in food. We ended up bringing KFC, bucket of chicken, potato wedges, and we brought a cooler of drinks. ( and a small table from a table in a bag, aweseome idea) The actors and performers were good we watched the play \"Tarzan\", which I never seen the movie, but quickly got the idea of it. We had a great section of seating and we sat on the end so it was nice when we had to get up we didn't have to bother anyone around us. It was a good to get away from the Strip, in cooler weather, chill by the mountains, and watch a show.\n",
      "After seeing this place pop up on Yelp and being featured in a newsletter/blog that I follow I decided to give these guys a try. They're only a 10 minute walk from my house so I thought this would be a great opportunity to find a new brunch spot close to home. I popped in Saturday morning with my girlfriend only to find out that they're doing brunch on Sundays only at the moment. No matter, I grabbed a tea to go, of which I had 4 choices of loose leaf varieties to choose from. The woman working was very friendly and explained how they're taking things one step at a time and slowly introducing more and more. Right now this is a great place to hang out during the day to grab a hot beverage and chit-chat with a friend or come in the evening for a cocktail or two. No open Wifi networks popped up during my visit so this may not be the place at the moment to hang out if you're trying to get work done/being a laptop hobo.\n",
      "Been here twice, enjoyed it both times. Great craft beer selection, everything from hoppy IPAs to sweet Belgian ales. Also an impressive cocktail menu, with some delicious concoctions. Try the Ruby for something sweet, or the Jacket Pocket for something a little more bracing Great intimate atmosphere, low lighting. Music and ambient noise is a little loud later in the evening. Place got busier the second time I was there, probably due to getting written up on BlogTO. Lots of hipsters\n",
      "Richard P from Northwood is now messaging me trying to convince me of the benefits of their 'tab' system. See my previous review, it does not work. He says its hard to do separate bills and a lot of work for servers and customers (huh?!)...so they don't want to do it. I wonder how all those other restaurants do it? Magic? Actually when you do split bills its so nice and easy for the customer and we love it!! For now I'll continue to avoid this place at all costs. Richard P's private messages to me explicitly told me that they do NOT do separate bills. They do allow you to try and calculate what you owe on the one bill that you receive, but that is NOT a separate bill. He also\" justified\" to me in previous messages why northwood doesn't do separate bills, so I'm not sure what his comment to my review even means. Regardless, I will never return after the rude service I received. As the server at the last restaurant I went to told me \"of course I can do separate bills for you, and any place that says they can't is lying or has severely outdated equipment\" If anyone wants clarification on what was sent to me, feel free to pm me! :)\n",
      "I came to Northwood for birthday drinks and left not at all disappointed -- which was a feat considering that the running theme of my birthday for the past few years is disappointment. Northwood is the type of place that feels like it fell right out of my dreams, and it would definitely go into the regular rotation if I was local. Perfectly friendly and non-intrusive service, makes a mean cocktail, serves coffee, and open til 2:00 am? Yes please. The time of year plus inclement weather meant that it wasn't busy when I visited, which made the atmosphere all the better for lingering over perfectly balanced cocktails. I selected the Pretty Vengeance for quaffing, and enjoyed it so much that I promptly ordered a second. If I could have torn myself away, I would have ordered one of the other delicious-sounding offerings, but there's a time and a place to stick with the tried and true (the time is your birthday, and the place is Northwood). I will be back, even as I attempt to recreate the sweet nectar created by combining vodka, vanilla liqueur, vermouth, pear, and cardamom for home enjoyment.\n",
      "I recently started going to Northwood with a couple of friends to do some work during the afternoon. I really like the atmosphere and the service, as the staff is nice and attentive. The decor of the place is fitting as it both a bar and café, and the tables are comfortable to sit on. The best part about the place, for those of us who have an incessant need to be connected to the grid, is the ample amount of plugs. I don't understand places that do not provide sufficient plugs for their customers--many of whom are graduate students or young professionals--, because it means that people who would become regulars--and spend more money--simply don't. I used to be a regular at another café nearby, but since they do not have many plugs--it was somewhat like Lord the Flies in there--I have opted to go to Northwood instead. In addition, they have free and fast wifi.\n",
      "My new favorite place. The atmosphere was both intimate and welcoming. We had prompt and friendly service and without doubt the best cocktails I've yet to experience in Toronto. Would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone.\n",
      "Finally! A place where I can drink high quality tea while my boyfriend can drink high quality booze Sweet concept for sure\n",
      "This is one of my own main haunts on Bloor West. The cocktails are awesome, the ambiance is wonderful for meeting up with friends, and I'm really happy that they've recently expanded their food offerings. Check out the rotating weekly dinner specials, I've eaten on my own a few times and also have dined with friends. I went for dinner with a party of four with mixed dietary needs (one vegan & g/f, one g/f omnivore, two omnivores who will eat anything) and we all walked away happy and well fed. That night I loved the pickle plate, beet tartare (yes beets!), the white bean dip, and some perfectly cooked brussel sprouts. As for the cocktails, I'm a gin drinker and love the Paper Moon, the Paradis is also quite nice.\n",
      "The newest hipster cafe/bar/saloon to hit Bloorcourt and the first really big makeover on this block in recent years, Northwood is brand new, opening its doors yesterday. The atmosphere was really enjoyable and relaxed but then again, there was only a trickle of customers coming in and discovering the place. If you ever entered Regal Gardens, the Chinese restaurant that pre-dated Northwood, the interior is not even recognizable in a wonderful way. They did a complete gut. The east wall is now exposed brick, a long bar on the west side featuring an eclectic cage holding all the liquor, a chalk board menu of preferred uppers and downers and a mish mash of old schoolhouse chairs, wicker bar stools, wooden benches and sturdy retro pub chairs. It's got that nostalgic dive bar feel without the actual griminess or smell, maybe because it's only seen one night of patrons so far but I appreciate this. It's clear a lot of thought went into the place and the furnishings, which is really refreshing. The staff are friendly, the coffee is good, the selection of sweeteners includes coconut sugar and maple sugar. I even had an enjoyable vegan cookie. Menu and brunch to come. I was promised vegan options which is enough to win my return patronage and if it's good, make me a regular. I did not check out the liquor but hopefully they have a nice selection of local and craft beers, as places like this are inclined to. The only drawback I saw was the extra .50c for soy-based drinks. Down with the soy tax!\n",
      "Been here a few times and despite trying other places we end up wanting to come back! The drinks are so good! We are hooked on the amazing varieties. Black walnut! White lodge! And death and company spin offs! Wish there was more finger food though! Ambience is great as well! Low key and not pretentious! I want to go again now!!\n",
      "Came here for a friend's birthday. Relaxed atmosphere, good selection of beers, moderately priced and good music. The place is a bit heavy on the moustaches and plaid, but a good time was had by all. It's small, so if you've got a big group, get there early!\n",
      "The owner has Phd in Film.... no wonder the lighting is sensational! I've never seen better lighting in a bar. Specialty cocktails are great. Lady Grey Sour... original and tasty. Yogi Berra might say... \"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded\". The last time I walked by, I wanted to stop in, but it was kind of packed.\n",
      "Another favourite local hangout. I usually go here because Northwood has some of the best coffee in the city--aside from Lit/Crema. The baristas do a great job, and they never mess up the espresso. Also, the cocktails are super inventive. I was here for brunch a few weeks ago, and it was delicious. I had the Northwood after explaining gluten allergies to the server. The bacon was really good quality, and the eggs were perfectly poached. I can confirm that the potatoes were crispy as advertised.\n",
      "In the middle of a major snowstorm what does one do when there is an event hosted by the Legendary Jennifer K well one braves the elements and digs in further. This spot is not that far from a subway stop though it did feel like quite a walk given the snow packed sidewalk. In summer one will hardly notice the distance. Nevertheless all the gloom disappeared when I saw the host sitting at the bar enjoying a drink. The setup is simple yet effective. They had a happy hour going on a Saturday till 7 for some draft drinks but I had to order a bottle of ST BERNARDUS ABT 12 since the first batch sold out at LCBO. The server was a bit taken aback as I guess not many people order this bottle and brought out the wrong glass at first and even had a bit of trouble opening the bottle. Nevertheless having it on the list is good enough in my book. The place has a laid back feel and is good spot to chat and enjoy, or just unwind which alright in my book. A great start to a great evening (or one can call it a good place to end a miserable day) 3.5 Stars. Will be back for sure.\n",
      "Northwood is far too often overlooked regarding their well thought out beer menu. With excellent options in style and brewery range, this place is a win! Recently they have started offering a more substantial food menu and it is all homemade and VERY tasty! Service is friendly, efficient and well informed. Oh and P.S. their coffee is delicious too!\n",
      "I was at Northwood on Friday August 8, 2014 with some friends. First the place has the worst menu...one of the dish is white beans blended in house with some dry bread! seriously!! you could at least use real beans. It tasted like water sewage. I am still washing my mouth from that. Now I was Ok with that after all it is a drinking place so I did not go there for the food. Now we were a big group. We asked them to split our bills since we were drinking and we were not attached by the hips! The answer was no we do not do that unless you wanna give us your credit card and we open a tap. My boyfriend and I said yes to this. We gave our visa and order drinks and some lame food as follows: Ginger ale 3 beers that awful white beans with the dry bread some even more awful cheese (I really hate French wanna be restaurants) one scotch one cider *extra side dish of bread. Now, my b/f and I wanted to leave the party earlier so I approached the over worked bartender. I should mention now the place gets busy and they are very under staffed. I told him we had a tap and I would like to clear it. He gave me a bill and I noticed the scotch and three beers were missing...I told him about this omission....you see I could just not mention about this but I am a normal citizen not a thief! He went back and added the drinks...here is my problem. He ADDED what I told him was missing but DID NOT TAKE IT OUT OF WHERE ELSE HE HAD IT! I mean yea busy but it is not my job to move drinks from one tap to another. Now one of my friend called me the next day and told me they over charged her exactly those 4 drinks that I told him he was missing. I sent the receipt to my friend and told her that it was paid in full except that side bread. I forgot to mention the extra sad bread order was not on my bill. I told my friend I am sorry I forgot the extra stupid bread...but I was pissed the restaurant charged my friends for something ALREADY PAID FOR! Now this is my advise to Northwood or any other bar establishment serving groups that are not gonna all come together or leave together and not providing 5star menu: If you are too cheap to have a system where you can put numbers so people can have different bills, perhaps you should not be in the bar business. No 10 people go to a place to have drinks and need to wait until the end of the night to pay all at the same time!!!!!! this is stupid! You are Bloor and Ossington, a place to go before you go somewhere else...read your targets!!! If you think your staff cannot keep track of who drinks what (assuming your staff is sober), funny you assumed your drinking patrons should do the calculations and the remembering! It all boiled down to service. Your service sucks. You basically robbed my friend. I will never be back at the Northwood and I hope you do not rip off others like you did to us. Also BTW, your staff was defensive...not sure if this was being overworked or underpaid or just cranky but guess what, I wished I did not tip you... Have good short life.\n",
      "Not only is the decor cute and atmosphere hip and welcoming, but their good is unique and delicious. I loved the white bean dip and all their sandwiches looked amazing. Also if I could have the waiter with the ice blue eyes again that would be fantastic.\n",
      "My husband and I came here with the baby on a lazy Sunday afternoon while our 3 year old was with a family member. It was pleasantly busy, and we managed to snag a 4-top by the window. Service was pleasant and fast. They have 4 or 5 beers on tap, including two from Beau's Brewery (yum)! They also had a full cocktail menu, if that's your thing. The day we came they were doing a pop-up brunch, $20 pp for an appetizer, main, and dessert. We are vegan, and that wasn't a problem at all. The food was delicious and creatively done. Other than that, they had some baked goods on offer, but I didn't see any vegan options for those (I could be wrong though). One of the bartenders is my fave bartender who used to work at Disgraceland down the street, and she's a total sweetheart and is GREAT at what she does. I would love to come back here at night and check out the vibe. One complaint: I really wish that they had drip coffee. I almost took off a 1/2 star, but I really liked this space so much that I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n",
      "I came here for drinks after Karaoke and they had an excellent selection of cocktails and other late night drinks. The atmosphere was great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly. It's a very chilled out spot with fun loungey music that makes it feel very intimate. Don't come here expecting to dance or be rowdy, it's not that type of crowd.\n",
      "The perfect place to down a few bottles of Dieu du Ciel Rosée d'Hibiscus in the middle of winter when you're really missing summer. Love the mood lighting and actual candles this place has - full of character without trying too hard.\n",
      "Every time I return to Toronto this is my first stop for a gorgeous cocktail. The real deal. Best on the block. Homemade bitters, aged cider, crafts beers & a ton more & my favourite the Choupette - elderflower, lemon, thyme and gin. The snack menu is pretty yummy too, I usually go for the plate of pickled veg. The space is super cool yet romantic. Percect for a date or hang. They've usually got a great DJ spinning too. During the day, the coffee is aces and the space is a dream for getting work done.\n",
      "I came here for a Yelp event was very impressed by the nice intimate setting for a bar and the very friendly bartenders. I had one of their cocktails called the \"Lady Grey Sour\", which was an Earl Grey rye, lemon and black pepper. It went down very smooth. That can be dangerous for me. Anyways, the assortment of drinks is very good and is definitely a good bar.\n",
      "It's hard to imagine this placed once house a chinese restaurant selling shit on a tray. The owners of Northwood have transformed it into a cafe-cocktail lounge, doing random pop up dinners every so often, and real cocktails at night. I'm very appreciative that they serve cocktails the traditional way, with blocks of ice to ensure your drink doesn't get watered down. At $10 a cocktail, it's very reasonable for the two ounce pour delicious tasting mixed drinks Their 10th & Arch (bourbon, maple syrup base is delicious on so many levels. The Lady Grey Sour was very unique to say the least. Also, they carry a great selection of beers and some that i didn't even know were still brewed (when was the last time you say anyone actually carry Stroh in Toronto). The place does get packed fast, and it's gaining popularity fast. So be prepared for that and arrive early.\n",
      "Just go to Northwood, it speaks for itself. I have been here a number of times, and the first time was a spontaneous choice as my boyfriend had just heard that a bar opened up around the corner from our apartments. So I went, and we brought along his out of town friends as well. The atmosphere is fantastic, not exactly a sea storm of young and beautiful and young and restless youths doll'd up to indulge in the consumption of sweet sweet liquid luck that will hopefully lead them to sweet sweet bedroom luck. Not that you cannot achieve that, I mean, their beer menu has the most amazing selection ranging from local blends, to Deu du Ciel, Cheval Blanc, and Beau's (a personal preference)! And the cocktail artist makes fantastic gin creations, also their bourbon is...well...as good as bourbon can excel to be. And the music is soulful! But what I am trying to get at is that in Northwood, there is a crowd that will appreciate your chiller conversational mood, and will happily adapt to your fluctuating happy intoxicated and comically conversational mood as you keep ordering lovely rounds of lovely things! Sometimes they will have an amazing chef in the house, he will cook up the most amazing pop up menu for dinner, or tiny bites, or just midnight snacks that go really well with the fantastic musical accompaniment that they will provide on certain wonderful evenings. If there isn't a DJ spinning very soulful jazz and funk vinyls to ignite your conversational moods, then there will be a DJ spinning really earthy shoe gaze rock and roll beats as they dim the lights so your refreshing moods are the only things that light up the atmosphere at night. Once, Brandan Canning was there spinning, along with a chef, but I could not go. Like their facebook page because they will update you on sweet events, and specialty beers being added! Also, a perk, they are open daily from 10am to 2am! So what are you supposed to do at Northwood at 10am? Well, the cafe atmosphere there is amazing, I go there for conversation dates, reading, and sometimes get a nook in the corner with a tab growing with Americano orders and just do my homework all day. The barista there is a fantastic person! The coffee creations are amazing, the music is delightful, the crowd is a wonderful mixture of the most interesting and exciting and sometimes the most calming people you may want to start a conversation with, or merely just exchange a smile and a laugh with or ask for the time. I love it here. It's exactly what the growing suburban and urban members of the Chirstie Pits neighbourhood needed to come together and be happy.\n",
      "Stopped in for a quiet Sunday night. Staff was kind and prompt. The toddy warmed us up, and the wine was lovely. The lighting really made the place feel intimate and almost secret like a speak easy.\n",
      "Northoods brings a decent bar to an area of Toronto that has somehow been devoid of good bars, although it's an awesome place if you like kimchi and soon tofu. The DRINKS: --BEER: They have a pretty extensive bottle list, all at rather high mark-ups, 3-4 times LCBO prices. They have a decent but not amazing draft list. Lots of focus on Beau's, which is one of the weaker Ontario breweries. I was astonished to drink a tasty, but standard-production Beau's for $9.50/pint. Woah, that's crazy-town pricing. Thankfully, happy hour made it normal for $2 off, but there's no excuse to price a standard non-barrel aged American pale ale like that. --COCKTAILS: They have a good cocktail list and apparently a pretty diverse set of ingredients. I ordered the Vieux Carre, a cocktail I had been looking for here for a while, but it unfortunately was underwhelming. The flavors were off, fairly watered down...I think the server/bartender/everything else was harried, so I think it spent some time sitting in ice. I also think the vermouth was low quality...not the nice richness that helps balance this drink of say a carpano antica. This cocktail is also made with 1.5 oz of liquor...for a drink with no mixer, that's but one shot (and at $11). Maybe that's why they felt so compelled to water it down to make it look presentable in a glass. The FOOD: Very limited menu! Just a few sandwiches...didn't try. The SERVICE: Very good when it was available. When we were there it was pretty full and it seemed like one guy was doing all the waitering, cocktail making, and beer pouring. He was super friendly and knowledgeable when you had his attention, but we mostly didn't have attention. On the whole, this place is too expensive for what's on offer. Not going to rush back.\n",
      "Walked in to this bar by chance and was thoroughly impressed. Emily was a charming host and made me feel like this was my local pub. The cocktails were delicious and proportioned to maximize strength without compromising taste. 10/10 would try again.\n",
      "Came here on a Saturday night after dinner in ktown, which was just a short walk away. The place was fairly packed around 9pm and we got a seats at the bar, the atmosphere was great! I ordered a their cocktail special which was a \"punch\" with rum and spices and it was very good! They also have a good beer selection and drinks were reasonably prices. The place is a little small so the waitress would bump into me sometimes walking from the kitchen to the tables and there were limited number of hooks for your bag and coat but will definitely be coming back for drinks and checking out other restaurants in the area!\n",
      "Coffee was fine but waiters are slow and kind of too cool for school. Nice decor and selection though.\n",
      "Cute and cozy spot for beer, especially during the daily (!) happy hour. One day when my beer bud and I were exploring that end of Bloor for the first time, we saw the sandwich board advertising $2 off any beer between 5 and 7. I made a mental note for us to come back. We're glad we did - we love the vibe, the decor, the service. This isn't a local for us, but we make a point of coming in for a pint when the location and timing works out. This is the first place we tried Kissmeyer on tap. A tad pricey during regular hours (we've found it for significantly less), but nice at $6.75 (before tip). The place does fill up from 5 to 7, so be warned you might not find a table if you arrive too late or come with too many people. Some folks make this their coffee and laptop spot during the late afternoons and this spills over into happy hour. A lot of people are here for the cocktails, not the beer, so it's fun to sit at the bar and watch the concoctioneering.\n",
      "Another amazing gem in the neighbourhood - excellent coffee shop by day and bar by night. Northwood keeps us coming back for great coffee and superb cocktails. The music at night is just right. A new favourite, can't wait to try one of their pop up dinners or brunch.\n",
      "I was here a few months ago for a co-worker's birthday outing and I was pleasantly surprised that they also served coffee in the mornings. I recognized one of the bartenders who was previously a barista at Lit Espresso Bar - Alex Castellani. Really cool guy. Anyway, I'm seldom out in these parts of the west end, but I really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere they provided. The cost for booze was moderately priced - a bit more than I'm comfortable with, so I usually stick to 2 cocktails max. Anything after that is if I'm feeling splurgy (or want to get drunk). They've got a decent selection of wines, craft beers, liquors and cocktails sourced from all over the world. They've also got a decent patio too if you're ever in the area and want to hit a patio to have to imbibe in their delicious libations. If alcohol isn't your thing, they also serve coffee as well, with expertly pulled espresso based drinks from their two group Synesso espresso machine.\n",
      "Nice place with a fantastic atmosphere, assuming you don't mind the indifferent, hipster staff that work here (which in turn attracts a largely hipster crowd). Drink selection is great though and worth a visit. Patio is being worked on now and should be open any day.\n",
      "Really enjoyed my time here on a Friday night. It was just busy enough and there was a great vibe inside, with a perfect soundtrack of old school hip-hop beats. I had the No. 9 (Dark as Night, Sweet as Sin -- $12) and the No. 8 (7 1/2 Floor -- $9) cocktails, and both were EXCELLENT. I was particularly fond of the No. 8, which was on the sweeter end as far as cocktails go, and went down nice and easy. There was also a late night snacks menu on offer, and although I didn't have the chance to sample any of the food, I was intrigued by the options ranging from Agedashi Tofu to Beef Sam. Half the place has more of a cafe feel, with a lovely exposed brick wall, and the bar side feels a little bit \"grungier\" and more industrial. Looking forward to returning again soon!\n",
      "Toronto gets it. At least its nightlife industry gets it. This is yet another golden lit, dark-walled, laid back, approachable bar that says, 'hither, but where else is there the cackle of drunken kids, heartwarming thirtysomethings and comedic snarling trios of women along with shots of fernet, and a casual, open enough space for anyone who isn't interested in drinking?\" It could be the fact that I hail from the land of more bars per capita than most places but somehow most bars are packed, and I have the feeling I've seen it all... but, from an outsider's perspective... the approachability of a bar is more important than anything else, and Northwood gets the point: there's no fucking curtain, there's no hostess ready to say no, and there's no line. There are chairs outside in case you want to wait for a better seat... there's standing room inside. There's low tables, bench tables and a bar. Service was massively attentive and casual. Table service through the night with plenty of water top offs. And, with the fernet on the menu that can be slung back or taken a nip off of... this place is like an alternatively better version of many hideouts in SF. People in Canada are nicer. The drinks are cheaper. And there's more leg room.\n",
      "I am far too old and grumpy to put up with wobbly chairs and tables, overpriced cocktails and a ridiculous menu. The staff seemed to hate their jobs while we were there. I get it. I have hated serving tables too. I really think that this place is best for a burgeoning young relationship where you aren't eating anyway and are trying to impress your date with how sophisticated you are.\n",
      "Great place for cocktails and drinks. They have an extensive menu for cocktails, beer, wine, and other liquors and everything I tried were satisfying. The food menu is very limited so would not suggest it if you are looking for a good/full dinner. The place is dim, not too noisy, and very relaxed.\n",
      "My favourite bar in our hood! So happy to have this place close to our home. Great craft beers as well as yummy fresh cocktails, and the snacks were great, too! The cocktails are $12-16 range, which is fair compared to other cocktail bars like this downtown. Oh, and great patio for the summer! YAY!\n",
      "Good atmosphere, good snacks, great alcohol list, and love that you can order non-alcoholic drinks into the wee night: lattes, hot chocolates etc.\n",
      "The atmosphere is what you pay for here. Cocktails will run you $12-15 and a beer on tap is about $7-10. The drinks are pretty good though and the wait staff is courteous and friendly. Sitting at the window bar was quite nice although the place got exceptionally loud on a Tuesday evening such that I was effectively yelling by the end of the night.\n",
      "Where's Northwood, GPS? Intersection of Plaid and Grads, with a side of Kimchi. I stumbled inside. I stumbled to the back. I stumbled downstairs. By the time my eye glasses cleared up I had landed, at the bottom. Vintage and cosy warm, I must have slipped down a hippie rabbit hole in space/time. No matter, I'm glad they had urinals instead of outhouses in this snow stormy weather. I pulled myself upstairs and saw a note. Beware: slippery stairs. Wish I had read that. This evening I sat at the bar listening to one of my all time favourites, Milk Frothing. I wish I had time for coffee but alas 'twas a beer-crawl and I know my limitations. Why not take a cold-brew (http://northwoodto.ca/cold-brew/) for later? Apologies, out-of-stock. We sat, drank, chat like Canadians at a Canadian café/bar The end.\n",
      "I was meeting two of my oldest friends here for a little catch-up session, and thought \"Hey, great idea: I'll bike straight from work! It's only Bay/Bloor to Christie Pits, that's like 10 minutes. -15 is nothin'.\" Idiot. My hands froze solid. Halfway there I kicked my chain off completely, and had to do a sidewalk pit stop to get it back on. By the time I got there, my fingers were so numb, I couldn't even get my bike lock undone. I rushed inside to defrost, and realized I couldn't get my helmet off. So there I am inside Northwood, fully clad in coat, balaclava and helmet, blowing hot air into my hands and watching my bike suspiciously in case a lunatic impervious to the cold decided to run away with it...for 10 minutes! Relevance? The friendly bar staff made no jests at my expense. Thankfully. Though I felt shame. I finally de-iced, locked-up, my friends showed up smiling and eager for a few child-free hours (3 kids between the two of them.) We were thrilled by the $2-Off-All-Beer deal between 5-7pm (every night!) and ordered some tall bottles of suds (I'm an 1850s prospector, consarn it.) I had a Garrisson IPA and a Chimay Blue. Both warmed me appropriately for the frosty trip home. We also ordered some snacks! They suggested getting a few dishes, since the plates are small. This was true and good advice, but the beer was filling enough that I think we were satisfied. In any case, my Root Vegetable Winter Salad was phenomenal. Beets, carrots, rutabaga & radish, with goat cheese and sunflower seeds. My taste buds danced around the flavours like a Bill Cosby tapdance-off, and when it was over everybody won. I can't wait to try and recreate it at home (The salad, not the tapdance competition. My neighbour already passive-aggressively bangs my walls to complain about the reasonable level my GF plays Sarah McLachlan, I don't need the downstairs neighbours finding an excuse to poke at their ceiling with a Swiffer.) Anyway, it's a great space, the cocktails are also good, and now that I know the food is good I'll be coming back more often. Not in this weather though.\n",
      "A welcome addition to the bloor west hood. Impressive list of (bottled) beer and a few nice draughts. Wine list & cocktails are unique. Snacks are served (sandwiches and the like) and good coffee is part of the mantra. Possibly the best iced drip coffee i have ever tasted. No milk or sugar required! I like when cafes are true to their name: serving both caffeine and booze in true European fashion. The patio is lovely, as is the interior. The bathrooms are spotless and have a cozy cottage-like charm. Thumbs up!\n",
      "I wish I owned some kind of share in this place that allowed me to always have a table here. Living around the corner I've spent a few years finishing a bottle of wine with friends and facing the dark options of a Bloor West selection of bars whose zenith was Pour Boy's (yeah there's Piston or 3 Speed but..I dunno. We never jived.) Now instead of walking into decades of burps and sad old zoo cougars, we get to hop over to Northwood; fresh paint and friendship. It's a comfy and beautiful spot, and the drinks are priced up but not high (a single Fernet with lemon was $5.60, for example). Daytime: My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time mid-morning, and had really pleasant espressos looking out on Christie Pits in the sunny front window. Crowd: I know it's hard for some to hear, but \"hipsters\" are just people under 35 with a shred of whimsy. Conclusion: The world is great and I love it.\n",
      "Took a half hour to be told that the \"snack\" I ordered was no longer available. Took another 15 minutes to be given something that looked like dog food and had a chefs hair in it! Yuck!\n",
      "Was sitting outside and the wood table was crawling with little tiny bugs :/ had to keep shooing them away with their menu! Other than that the drinks were food with good craft beer and wine selections. Had their Old Fashioned and the orange/ice was done right! Didn't have a chance to try their food but the atmosphere inside looked perfect for a summer night. Friendly staff and very relaxing vibe. Will be back :)\n",
      "This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, which used to be a bit meh. Northwood is definitely not meh. The atmosphere is conducive to productive work during the day and the Cold Brew is really choice. Five stars to Brian who handled some really delicate customers last time I was in! Northwood has delicious & amazing cocktails. I highly recommend the Lady Grey cocktail--complete with cracked black pepper. Also Beau's Lug Tread on tap make it an even better local watering hole. Go here, it's just what you needed.\n",
      "Definitely one of the best cocktail bars and cafes in town. If you are looking for a place to have a great drink and great conversation, don't miss out on Northwood My personal favourite is their cocktails with coffee in them. You can have it in the late afternoon and get re-energized. If you are looking for food, this is not the place to go for. Snacks are good but not food food.\n",
      "Very nice coffee place. Great oatmeal raisin cookies\n",
      "There are already too many photos here of cocktails rested near laptops, so I'll spare you. What I love most about Northwood is that it's a daytime cafe that smoothly transitions into a bar. So if you want to come here around, say, 2pm, and work away on your laptop with, say, a cocktail instead of a coffee (or a cocktail *with* coffee in it), who's to judge... The place is clearly designed for the academic and creative-industry crowd, who make up the majority of its patrons. They have a wicked cocktail menu and a great atmosphere -- that rare balance between casual and classy, with an expected hipster crowd but no obnoxious behaviour. The staff are attentive but not intrusive. I come here at least once a week to catch up with a friend or to write on my own while sipping a drink. It's my favourite bar, and I don't even live near its neighbourhood. The LADY GREY SOUR cocktail is probably their signature drink, is excellent, and is exactly as it's described. But my favourite is STORM BREWING, which is a twist on the classic Dark & Stormy with a clever addition of their in-house cold brew coffee. This drink is definitely not for everyone, but it's layered and unexpected in all the right ways. When their experienced bartender(s) make it, it's brilliant. However, they seem to have a fairly steady bartender turnover, and many of their secondary bartenders make a poor and disappointing version (either far too sour or using flattened ginger beer). If you're really feeling adventurous, try the Black Lodge cocktail, but for me the combination of tequila, cold brew, agave sweetness, and egg white proteins is all wrong and totally undrinkable. They had some other amazing cocktails in the winter, and I'm looking forward to them switching the menu up again. So, if I can't stop coming to this awesome bar, why only 4 stars? First: the uneven drink preparation. I never thought much about the importance of \"mixology\" until coming here over the course of 8+ months and noting the really wide variety of quality in the drinks. For instance, in the winter, I used to order the Vieux Carre cocktail, which is difficult to balance well and *demands* top-notch ingredients. When one of the owners (or whom I imagine to be a key bartender, at the least) makes it, he takes great care and tries the drink, sometimes adjusting to get it right. The last time I attempted to order it, with a different bartender, it tasted way off and the rye whiskey itself was poor quality. When I mentioned to the bartender that it doesn't balance as well as always, she gave me a puzzled expression and said \"but it's such an easy one, I just poured whatever it said in the recipe.\" [easy one? it has 6 components...] I realize I might be more picky than most, but a great cocktail menu (at great-cocktail prices, no less) deserves better. Second, the food here is not good, at all. I think they're still trying to work out their kitchen, and I get the sense that the owners' heart isn't in the culinary side as much as the beverages. Don't come here hungry and don't plan to eat. It's a cafe/bar and it's totally amazing at doing just that.\n",
      "Oh boy... I'm not happy writing this. Service here is how I expect war criminals to be served in heaven. (Ignored, awful) I have been here around 20 times and around the last ten have been some of the laziest instances of service. Don't you want to come to my table and take more drink orders?? Don't you want to make money?? Sitting half an hour without a drink order on a table and no water glasses is insane and I am embarrassed to stay I stayed. It is never very busy when I come. And having to beg for the bill only to see the bartender start cleaning tables after saying \"yes\" is creepy. It's also creepy when they only pay attention to you when they want your money. This happens all the time. Once the bill is down they're like vultures. Good luck on the patio in the summer as you could be having a heart attack and none of the staff would notice. They would probably start cleaning tables around your dying body.\n",
      "Really wished this place was around when I worked in the Bloor & Shaw area. The last time I walked by this location it was a questionable Chinese restaurant. I couldn't help but notice there's something much better going on when I strolled by the other day. I could sense it was a coffee shop when I walked in based on the amount of people clicking away on their laptops. I figured I would rest my feet at the bar and have my fourth cup of coffee that day. I looked around to see if there was a menu and grabbed their clipboard -- it listed all the fancy coffees they make, but thankfully they had three edible options at the bottom. I opted for the ham & swiss sandwich. Americano was good. Girl working there was friendly, and the decor was quite nice. It's not a unique experience with lots of wood & black paint (similar to Beaconsfield or Churchill) but I appreciated the effort in making the place comfortable. Quite a bit of time passed since I finished my drink and I was wondering if my sandwich was coming or not. I was actually about to pack up and forget about it, but then a dude finally came with what turned out to be a rather delicious hot snack. Maybe not worth the six-plus dollars it cost (though it came with grapefruit which I skipped) but I was still satisfied. Would really like to see some more snacks. Even maybe just some baked goods like muffins or cookies. I realise it's also probably a rocking bar at night, but if it's going to do the coffee shop vibe in the morning/afternoon I would like to have a little more variety. I would have killed for some soup.\n",
      "I stopped in here with a friend for a drink in between other stops on our route on a Friday night. Obviously with such great reviews, we were looking forward to coming to Northwood. We walked in and it was very dark inside. No problem though, it was nighttime and it's a bar so the lighting was acceptable. Actually, this would be a GREAT place to bring someone when you're either not looking so hot or the person you're with isn't looking so hot! Anyway... The place was full when we walked in. All tables and bar stools were occupied but the guy behind the bar motioned to an empty table at the back and so we sat there. A server came to our table promptly with a menu. When she returned to take our order, my friend was in the washroom. I ordered a dubbel ($9) (so glad this beer is so often on drink menus now), and I told the server that my friend would order when she returned to her seat. Our server brought my drink along with a bottle of water and two glasses. My friend was still checking the menu. The server never returned... NEVER. I finished my beer and she hadn't even come by again ONCE! We decided that since the service sucked we'd be on our way. I put $12 (a 10 and a twoonie) on the table to cover my beer+tax+tip. After we were walking down the street, my friend handed me the twoonie I had left. She said she took it because the server didn't deserve it. I actually felt pretty bad because that meant I was actually 17 cents short on the actual bill with tax. I was then a little embarrassed that I ended up being short, but whatever. Anyway, I'm sure this place is great with a different server. I'd totally come back, pay my amount owing from my first visit and leave an appropriate tip on whatever I had during my return. (I just wouldn't bring a friend who might reclaim my tip money!) Even though the place was busy, the crowd was a little tame. Everyone was seated so my first impression was that this is more of a date place. (Actually, as far as ambiance, it reminded me a bit of Bar Volo). So yeah, the poor rating is really just based on the service, which was as I mentioned: non-existent. That said, I totally want to go back. And if anyone from Northwood is reading this... I'm seriously really sorry about being 17-cents short! (Not so sorry my friend scammed the tip as it wasn't really deserved anyway).\n",
      "Thanks to my DT-TO partner in crime Evelyn W for bringing me to her secret happy place where good things come in a cup all day long. She invited me here on a GTA/TO work day and said this was the place to be for Coffee, Cocktails and WiFi. I arrived a tad early and got a chance to scope out the joint for myself and was really impressed with the caged in bar, uber clean basement bathrooms and the espresso machines spoutin' steam ready to whip up my order. Even got a few moments alone with the morning barista before the crowds flocked in, she was very knowledgeable about her bean and made me a stellar Americano that kept the fire going most of the morning! After taking a brief break for lunch, we returned and I sat with a great cup of tea while I did my afternoon work. Upon our afternoon return Northwood was bustling with would be bloggers, next-gen work from hom-ers and various other Apple computer users. One item of note that as the body count rises in here, so to does the temperature and before long I was stripped down to my undershirt and jeans. So ensure you layer even in the dead of winter. While the preceding Americano and Tea were essential parts of my functioning day, the part I enjoyed the most was my end of day cocktail. A real treat lay in store for me as I let the staff choose my poison for me and I was blessed to be granted the opportunity to sip on their Smoked Old Fashioned done with maple syrup... So many Canadian flavours in my mouth at one time!!! I felt like was wearing flannel and a toque (I probably was), while sitting in a Quebec sugar shack, dining on Moose Meat and duck while watching Hockey Night In Canada. Yes! All that came to me whilst sippin' on this sweet-n-smokey delight!\n",
      "Would move to the neighborhood just to visit Northwood more often. The experience at Northwood is special, from the music to the staff and (most importantly) the drinks. It's the perfect spot for date night drinks, or catching up with a small group of friends. I can't think of anywhere else in Toronto that you get 2-2.5 oz cocktails for such reasonable prices ($11-14 for most), and they are some of the best drinks you'll have in the city. My boyfriend and I went recently and each had 3 cocktails, each better than the last. Our favorites were La Commune and Black Walnut. The bartender we had last time was fantastic. She managed to get cocktails out to 30 people quickly, was able to answer questions about the drinks, and was really friendly. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "So happy to have a new coffee shop in this area!! Especially since some around here are not as good... I love the atmosphere and the server was so friendly and helpful. I got a brownie with caramel and salt it was sooo good and the tea they serve is from tealish so it was also tasty. I love that it's a coffee shop and a bar and stays open until 2am!! I mean really what more could you ask for. It really has it all. The only issue I would say is that some of the chairs don't have backs to them which can be annoying if you go to do work. They do have some chairs with backs but just be aware!\n",
      "I love sitting here in the afternoon to work. The interior is so nice, the coffee is good and it's possibly my favourite local chill out place. Admittedly I haven't been here in the evening for drinks yet but the cocktail menu looks smashing. One year later... I love this place even more.\n",
      "I spent the better part of a day at Northwood and enjoyed it so much I wasn't even tired of being there at the end of it all. The atmosphere is great for working during the day and socializing during the evening. Seriously, this cafe covers it all. An added bonus of being there so long means that I experienced a lot of what they have to offer, and from lattes to sparkling wine at happy hour, to cheese plates, everything I had I liked. The menus are small, but creative and the staff is efficiently friendly. It would be one of my main hangs if I lived in Toronto.\n",
      "Nice little bar with atmoshere and good selection of drinks, including some beers on tap. Little because seating might be limited, but patio in summer time is rather large. People are friendly.\n",
      "I dig Northwood. It's the perfect spot along the Bloor strip if you're not in the mood for a dive pub or sports bar. It's casual/classy, with a relaxed vibe that still feels special. I like how dimly lit it it. The cocktails and beer selection are awesome, though I will say slightly overpriced (hence the 4 stars). Overall a great place to hang, whether stopping in for a casual drink or going on a date.\n",
      "Northwood is a gem. The drinks are fun, the atmosphere is cozy and the rotating list of food is always interesting. Plus, the fact that it serves tasty coffee and snacks during the day is just great. Only disappointments: it tends to get packed with hipsters later in the night, and the NYE dinner was overpriced and not at all memorable. I think the quality of the food really depends on who's cooking/catering, and the staff seem much more used to bar tending than serving tables. But all in all, I really like this place!\n",
      "This is a great new addition to the neighbourhood - I haven't been during the day for coffee etc, but I'm in love with the atmosphere and coming here mostly at night. Have been here a few times always with great service, amazing cocktails and is now my new fav place for Buck-a-Shuck oyster nights on Wednesdays. Make sure to get there early though after 6 because it fills up! Had a small birthday gathering here and had no issues by calling a week in advance!\n",
      "Nice little bar in the Bloor/Ossington 'hood. Had a few delicious cocktails made by a very attentive lady bartender. Came for a food pop-up & enjoyed everything on the menu!\n",
      "I love this place but they're a tad overpriced. I find myself only ever going between 5-7 when it is $2 off draught.\n",
      "Went here for brunch yesterday. Bavette steak was satisfying, and precisely medium-rare, as requested. Veal poutine had \"home fries\"-style pieces of potato, rather than (long, thin) french fries (which was not explicit on the menu). This cuts down on the surface area and is sub-optimal for poutine. It also did not have quite enough cheese, nor quite enough gravy. The veal itself was moist and tender, which, for the most part, redeemed the dish. Pork and beef tourtiere was great (if you're into that sort of thing). The pastry was crisp and flaky, the interior was lightly spiced, saucy, and flavorful. There was a bit of apple sauce on the plate which provided some great complimentary sweetness and tartness. Stack-o-flapjacks was a gratifying way to spike my blood sugar, and the bourbon maple syrup was a nice touch.\n",
      "I was quite impressed with the variety of cocktails Northwood had in their menu. Since I like bourbon and cognac, I finally settled for the Tiki Old Fashioned (yes that's what it was called). It had that blended deepness of cognac with a citrus finish. Definitely a drink only for those that like hard liquor. I'm glad that the bartender was nice enough to describe the differences and particulars about each drink as I doubt any first timers like myself would know which cocktail to best order. Meanwhile, my friends also enjoyed there drinks but I don't remember the drink names (see pics for parts of their drink menu). Northwood is a cozy and chill bar to try unique cocktails and catch up with friends. Try to go earlier as I heard that it can get really packed by late evening. Cheers!\n",
      "Overall not worth it. I did enjoy the environment and set-up but menu was disappointing. For an appetizer I did order hummus and what I got in return was a few dozen seasoned garbanzo beans. And the chai latte was bland, it couldn't even wash out the bad taste in my mouth.\n",
      "So my last update was a little off. They have stopped with the oysters, and the patio isn't in full swing, but... They have done some pop-up menus with varying chefs, but it looks like they've got some keepers for supper hour and they aren't messing around. Get some of their delish delights (think: tortiere, pea soup with biscuits and braised beef poutine) to go with your craft cocktails and reasonably priced wine and beer. Mmm K?\n",
      "I came twice here and both times was turned away because they were at capacity. The first time I left my number and was texted back 1.5 hours later. It seems unbelievable that the next available seat needed a 1.5 hour wait. The second time there was clearly a woman at the bar leaving and an empty stool next to her but I still received the same response. I told the host not to bother taking my number. Maybe I don't fit the clientele or the host didn't want to bother serving me... the drinks were good in the past but I couldn't care for the host.\n",
      "Dinner service. Patio. Music. New website. Northwood, you go girl!\n",
      "I love the ambiance at this place. The staff is extremely nice and they serve really good cocktails. My favourite being the Choupette, its delicious. Mr. H and I go quite often and even took our friends from the US, everyone loved the place. We once had to wait a long time before a table was available, there was one empty table but the customers were out smoking (for like an hour!) and the waitress was getting annoyed too. She said she would ask them to leave once they came back and move us over and she made sure to follow through. The later in the night it gets to louder the place gets too so keep that in mind, the place does however have a relaxed vibe and fun to visit with friends. (Ps: i have only been here late nights)\n",
      "Amazing staff, owner is awesome. If you call a tab a \"tap\" I probably won't trust your review haha. Also if this guy hated the beans why did he ordered more bread? Such weird reviews for this place. Snacks are always great and it fills a hole in the neighborhood for a predrink spot!!!!\n",
      "Really loved this warm, friendly spot on Bloor near Christie Pits Park. I came here with friends on a warm summer evening. By 8 p.m. the patio was full, but there were plenty of seats inside. We stayed through the evening enjoying beers and conversation. The place got full, but never terribly crowded. Inside the decor and ambiance are tasteful and inviting. The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable. They have an extensive selection of draught and bottled beers. I also hear that they do amazing cocktails. Maybe next time! Northwood is definitely worth a return visit.\n",
      "Super hipster crowd here. Gotta love the exposed brick and wooden seating. Drink deals Are not the greatest but alright. I like the variety of light fixtures and cozy setup . Not much for appetizer situation. They cannot split bills, only offer cash machine that'll charge you.\n",
      "Great little bar with a cozy vibe. Came in on a snowy night to find to my delight that they serve 1/2 priced wine on Wednesday nights. That's a drink special I can get into. Sign me up for a glass for Sibling Rivalry for $4.5! I'll be back to give this place another try.\n",
      "Really great bar with a cool atmosphere and drinks to match. Always a really good atmosphere here at the weekends. The bartenders are great for helping with recommendations. It's very cosy and intimate. I lived right beside this bar in Toronto so I went all the time and now I can't wait to return.\n",
      "Meh. My friends were really excited to go to this place, as they had been previously and had really enjoyed themselves. Given the variety of bars in Toronto, this spot is a total take it or leave it. We were a reasonably large group and the servers didn't seem particularly interested in accommodating us even though there was a lot of space available when we arrived (and a reservation had been made) Overall, service was spotty and we were ignored after being there for awhile. Drinks were of average quality and very overpriced. I had a panini that was a bit soggy, chewy, and cold. Probably fine for one drink if you're alone or on a date.\n",
      "Didn't eat here, but the drinks & service were outstanding on a busy Saturday night for a very large group. They were attentive, personable and spot on. Great vibe. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Sick atmosphere and sexy chemists synthesizing seductive solutions.\n",
      "Bar Crawl #1: Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale & St Bernardus Abt 12 Happy Hour Everyday till 7 pm! $2 off drafts and bottles/cans. Sweet! Of course I have to start off with a pint: Beau's Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale ($5.50 with HH specials!) and my Yelp friend with a can of Howe Sound Lager ($4.5 with HH Special). And of course if you prefer some exquisite import: A bottle of St Bernardus Abt 12 ($28). The interior is dark, dim and cozy. I like how Northwood is a coffee/beer/cocktail drinking place as that means I can hang out here the whole day. Too bad they were out of the 8oz Cold Brew to go. I guess I have to come back soon to try out their cocktails and coffee! And free WIFI!! Oh that means I can even yelp a bit!\n",
      "Been here many times, it's always great! Amazing beer selection. Perfect date or just casual place. No pretentiousness, friendly service.\n",
      "Do you like being charged three times for one drink? Do you like snooty little witch waitresses in too-tight denim hipster shorts who can't add? Do you like waiters who disappear for hours at a time while glasses pile up on dirty tables? Do you like it when 25-year-olds roll their eyes at you unstoppably, as if they don't understand that you are customers, they are waiters, and it's their actual job to bring the drink you ordered an hour ago? WELL, IF YOU DO, THEN NORTHWOOD IS FOR YOU. I'll never go back. Paid three times for the same shitty beers just to avoid a fight when my bill was wrong several times over. Service horrendous. Staff utterly incompetent. I cannot understand all these positive reviews. I haven't has such a bad experience in Toronto in years.\n",
      "Fun and creative drink selection, including retro-style drinks. Lady Grey cocktail was very good. Nice ambiance!\n",
      "Went here last night to do the whole online-to-real life transition with somebody from eharmony. With a few of these sorts of meetings in my world these day, it seems like I'm really getting to know impressive places in the city to drink cocktails. Northwood is another winner. We sat outside on their terrific patio. Service was excellent. (Absolutely love it when a host and/or wait staff are observant enough to know when a table of two is a first date and then make extra effort to ensure a good/smooth time! This has happened a couple of times and it always means an extra tip--many, many thanks!) The interior, from what I saw, is great--seems like this place will really work in the colder months too. The cocktail list has about 10 interesting items and I'm sure the staff can make anything under the sun. I went with their gin and tonic. It was a well crafted, well presented G&T but quite honestly not something I'd order again. I prefer mine to be a bit more crisp and carbonated...maybe I'm just too used to what I made at home. Next up was their Paper Moon which I liked better--gin based, it is very sweet and delicious. It also has a bunch of booze in it that most people do not stock at home. My date enjoyed her \"Faith & Fortune\". We also got the nibbly snack basket thing. Northwood is a great place to enjoy a drink--and a huge improvement over that old Chinese food place. Recommended--especially for first dates!\n",
      "cozy, dim. too dim? booze bottles caged at the bar both brick and black walls staff is attentive friendly and hospitable just A+ service extensive beer list mostly bottles, a few taps many cocktails too sandwiches, snacks, sweets all of which i've never tried i just go for drinks sipping on cold brew i could spend all evening here one of my go-to's\n",
      "GO HERE for cocktails. The list is super long, and the staff is very helpful. The ambience is cute & cozy. Great for week-night cocktails after work. The food / snacks are OK. I'm a vegetarian and have ordered the white bean dip. The dip is really smooth with a great crunch on top with the addition of various seeds. The dipping vessel it comes with is a thin, gluten free crepe-ish bread which was also delicious.\n",
      "My friends and I happened to stumbled on this gem a couple of months ago on a Wednesday night. A deal was on for a buck oysters and half price wine and we took them up on the offer. It turned out to be a great decision. The oyster was fresh, the wine was chilled and the server was nice. We've since become regulars.\n",
      "Our server at the Crafty Coyote recommended Northwood to us. I had two cocktails - a Hot Toddy and a Violet Hour cocktail. The Violet Hour was the best tequila cocktail I have ever had. There were many cocktails to choose from and will definitely be back again for more.\n",
      "This is probably my favorite place to drink/sit/frig around on a laptop/watch people/get drunk at. It's very versatile. Opens at 10am, have some Pig Iron Coffee (get that stuff at Lit Espresso Bar, too), sit and watch Christie Pitts park, get a sandwich, switch to bourbon, see who goes in and out of Toronto BJJ across the street, order more bourbon, and repeat. Their cocktail menu is very impressive...not huge but the drinks on it are all delicious. I sort of regret writing this review because I don't want YOU sitting in my spot next time I go in. Yelp piggy backin', bastards.\n",
      "Expensive, small portions. Way over priced! Obviously too much labor to pay for this little restaurant! The number of servers and cooks on the line were nearing the number of patrons. The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. They need a consultant to help them with their labor distribution and realign their menu prices with their portion size.\n",
      "The stars are for service only as the manager and owner was extremely accommodating and did not charge us for the food we could not eat.. So that's the good part but you must be wondering Hope why would you go to a restaurant to not eat food?! Crazy I know, but the food was just that awful we could not force it down ! I ordered a few rolls and asked for cream cheese to be added because I like the creamy taste mixed with flavorful fish .. Keyword is flavorful . This tasted like eating a stick of cream cheese wrapped in rice, nothing else had Any flavor !! When I explained to the manager she tried to say well you added cream cheese and now you're complaining it tastes like cream cheese , fair point if there was nothing else in the roll, however a tiny amount of it should not completely over power everything else, don't blame the poor cream cheese dude, blame your lousy quality tasteless fish! We tried sashimi too and it literally had no taste on its own. The pork Gyoza was the only thing that tasted normal .. Speaking of which we asked for spicy mayo and if you have had sushi anywhere you know it's pretty thin and spicy. This was just regular thick globby mayo with probably food coloring as it was not spicy at all! Also their drinks were Flat and when I pointed it out I was told that's not possible it was just changed today ! Seriously you guys with broken taste buds stop leading us astray! Sushi station which is a revolving sushi bar tastes like 20x better than here, we went there after we left here since we only had a few bites each and were still hungry !\n",
      "When I rate a sushi place, first and foremost importance in my criteria is the fish itself. Everything else falls into palace after that. This is where Hana excels. The fish is extremely fresh and well cut. Hamachi sashimi is about as good as I've had in AZ. I throughly enjoyed the sashimi salad as well - tons of fresh fish mixed in with nice greens and tasty dressing. As for everything else, service is good enough, pace of kitchen is satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing here, but all good enough to keep coming back. Waitstaff is friendly. They hurry you a bit sometimes but it does get busy often so it's somewhat understandable. Overall a great place for fresh quality sushi and the byob is great as you can save the markup on a great bottle of sake or wine. Sushi: excellent Service: friendly, satisfactory Ambiance: neighborhood joint. Nothing fancy, not a dump though Price: very fair for some stuff, a bit overpriced for others.\n",
      "Very friendly staff, seated right away, came in close to 10 which is their closing time and still served us, even asked if we wanted anything else before they close the grill. It's a great place, good vibe to it, not a bad location. Definitely deserves the 5 stars.\n",
      "My wife loves Sushi, we live close this this place. We have been 3 separate times and the service has always and consistently been awful. The servers will forget about you, and the older Asian woman working there will ignore you. Stay Away.\n",
      "At last, a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot, and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere. It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT. I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast. The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough \"give,\" so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball. Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor! When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all. Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner. That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill. But it is worth it. It is so worth it. Check it out!\n",
      "Hana pops up in local accounts of the top places in Phoenix, and after dining here I understand the recommendation. The menu offers a selection that's more authentic than typical American-inspired \"teriyaki chicken and rice\" styled eateries. First on my list is the sushi, which really might be the best in the Valley. Hanna opts for minalistic perfection, offering a variety of high quality, melt-in-your-mouth nigiri, and a few foundation rolls, the albacore being especially noteworthy. Secondly, the atmosphere is genuine, with a packed bistro and sushi bar or outdoor deck--yes, a deck! We ordered clams, octopus tempora, pork ramen, and a sashimi bento. I wasn't blown away by the ramen, but then the price didn't blow up our wallets either. Maybe I'm just not that into noodles. All other items were a smash hit.\n",
      "What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy. For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated. With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day. Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying. Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious. Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here. Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting. Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that? Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty. Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.\n",
      "I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular. Perhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza. The Good: - the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful - the tempura was great, light and crisp - the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare. - the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places. - great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy' - quick, friendly service The Not so Good - the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen) - the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!) - the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?) - the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again) - the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen. One comment on the BYOB. While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix). Overall, the experience wasn't memorable. I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.\n",
      "I found that most of the things we tried here didn't have a lot of flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something was missing. From everything. I probably won't be back.\n",
      "M and I drop in for dinner on a weekday. The location of this place was a little tricky, but once you find it the food is good. The place is small, so get there early if not be prepared to wait for a table. I ordered the gyoza (Japanese Pan steamed dumplings), I was pretty good. For my entrée, I ordered the Hana Katsu (Golden breaded chicken breast infused with Koso butter). Wow, it was good... Lightly breaded, fried just right, chicken was juicy, and Koso butter was a good touch of flavor. For my dessert, I got the cream filled tempura (cream lightly battered to a golden crunch). It was done just perfect. The service was pretty good, she double check our orders maybe due to a language barrier, but either way our order came out perfect.\n",
      "Hands down best sushi/sashimi I've had in valley.. I know there are several other good sushi places in the Valley but they are too far of a drive for me to go. Its not cheap but its not extravagant. BYOB. Japanese-run. They also close for holidays and holiday weekends..so check before going. You will leave smelling like Tempura.\n",
      "This was the most authentic Japanese meal that I have ever had in the Southwest. I snapped a picture of my Tempura and Salmon Teriyaki dinner, sent it to a Japanese friend in Tokyo. She replied that food looked to very authentic and most delicious. It's a very busy place, so be prepared to wait a bit for a table. I suggest sitting at the sushi bar.\n",
      "I eat here once a week! Consistently good...great service and never been disappointed....my personal place for Uni!\n",
      "I had a group of people and we were looking for a good place to eat, we could not decide what we wanted, at Hana we were able to get a variety of different things. It was great and the food was amazing. Definitely worth going to, we will be back!\n",
      "I cannot say enough about about this restaurant. Hana may be the best Sushi in the Phoenix Metro area! Expect a 20-40 minute wait on weekends as its popular among the locals. Owned privately and well managed, the service was impeccable. The table was frequently cleaned and maintained by anyone in the vicinity. The Sushi was fresh, mild and tender as should be. I would give 5 stars except for the host and hostess lack of attention to the wait list. We waited 50min instead of the 20 we were told. They just overlooked us.\n",
      "The person above with 'duplicate review' has a link to a different restaurant. This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th St. Corkage, byob! This is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now. Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own sake, wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in). Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi, always fabulous specials on the board, and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi. Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent, this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes. Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi, even if it isn't on the short menu. They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available. I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here. And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world. I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good. One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available, amazing flavor and texture, very japanese. mmmm. Not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday, closed on Mondays. Regular hours through the week.\n",
      "It was around 12:30 pm and I was hankering for sushi. I was actually planning on going to the new Pure on 7th St, but when I walked into Pure, the restaurant smelled overwhelmingly like bleach, so I left and went to Hana. Hana, as always, did not disappoint. The food and the service here are consistently excellent. It was lunchtime, and they were busy, but turnover was pretty quick, and there was no wait time. There was also ample space in the parking lot. I had the Hana Bento Box, which could easily have feed two people! You begin with miso soup and a small salad, and then the box arrives, overflowing with food. In the box is a delicious assortment of vegetables, an assortment of tempura vegetables and shrimp (the batter was so light and crispy and perfect, the vegetables were a wonderful assortment, and both the shrimp & the veggies were perfectly cooked), 6 pieces of different sashimi, a California roll, and a slice of orange. My only regret is that I didn't take a picture because it was phenomenal! Thanks Hana--I'll be back!\n",
      "Make sure you go to the right Hana. There are 2! We were traveling through Phoenix and found great reviews about Hana sushi here on Yelp. HOWEVER there are 2 sushi restaurants in Phoenix named Hana and they are NOT the same. The one you should end up at is called Hana Japanese Eatery and is located at 5524 N 7th Ave Phoenix. It is NOT the Hana Sushi located #3, 602 West Union Hills Drive Phoenix, AZ 85027. We found this out the hard way after Googling Hana and driving to the wrong location.We realized right away we were at the wrong Hana and left immediately to find the right one. Glad we did as the Sushi at Hana Japanese Eatery was some of the best we have eaten in a long time. Rolls were unique, large, an very fresh! Service was excellent as well and prices very fair for the high quality Sushi that arrived on our table. Also one of the best Miso soups wee have had in a long time. Our absolute favorites of the rolls we ordered were the Spicy Tuna hand rolls and the Baked Salmon roll. Just incredible! A first for us as well was that along with the standard Wasabi Paste you get at every Sushi joint, you also get fresh chopped Wasabi plant. It looks like relish when they serve it, but it's actual Wasabi plant. It's fiery hot and really awesome on the sushi. It is clear why this place is rated highy by Zagat and well reviewed. Amazing and Fresh Sushi with great service!! 5 Stars well deserved.\n",
      "This place is the best. Awesome atmosphere, great service, and the best sushi I've ever had! And it's byob which is amazing. Enough said\n",
      "Ever since I have moved back from Japan I have been looking for some place that feels and tastes like home. Because, that is what Japan was for me. It was home. I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food. Well Hana is not it... :P But it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso. In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!\n",
      "I'm a huge Japanese cuisine and Sushi connoisseur so I had to write a review after the amazing lunch today at Hana. Hana is not your typical Japenese restaurant, it's the real deal and offers an extensive menu. A few of the items we ordered were the Salmon & Albacore Sashimi and it was so fresh. They provide both fresh and wasabi spread which is wonderful. Their Albacore was truly some of the best I've ever had which was topped with browned scallions, and avocado slices. Hana is Japenese owned and operated restaurant which explains the attention to detail, as well as the amazing menu. Rick, their Sushi chef prepared our sushi and it was beautifully prepared, as well incredibly fresh. I also want to give a shout out to our waiter today, Jake, who took great care of us and did a really great job providing us with some really wonderful recommendations. It's alway so nice when the wait staff knows the menu. I was also pleased to find out that Hana also offers BYOB, and even provides a wine bucket and glasses. I will have already recommended Hana to many of my friends and this will definitely be one of my regular places to eat.\n",
      "First time customer! I had Tonkotsu Ramen & it was delicious! It's a cozy mom-n-pop place, & it's very clean. The service was friendly & attentive. Definitely recommend this place & I'll be back!\n",
      "Hana's got the best spicy tuna roll! The quality is super fresh and I can't go anywhere else. It just doesn't taste the same.\n",
      "Hana is the only Japanese restaurant I will eat sushi in Phoenix. Their prices are quite reasonable, and the quality and freshness is always exemplary. I dine in sometimes, but I often get it to go, since I live nearby. It's pretty busy in the nights, especially the weekend. The nigiri and sashimi are my favorites on the menu. My usual run to Hana includes eel nigir, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, and sometimes salmon sashimi. They are very generous on their cuts of sashimi, and I don't feel ripped off as I have at other restaurants with paper thin slices of fish. They are always mindful if you have any food allergies and will ask you up front if you have any. So all you lactose-intolerant folks, definitely check out this place. Expect to pay around $40 for a nice amount of sushi, but you will leave satisfied and know you're paying for fresh and great quality food.\n",
      "\"Irashaimase!\" means Welcome! Traditionally, proprietors shout this to you as you walk in to their establishment in Japan and Hana is no exception. As a Japanese native, I have very fond memories of how my food tasted while I was growing up. So far, there are only two restaurants I've tried in Arizona that have traditional sushi and dishes unique to Japanese home style cuisine. Hana is one of them. Sushi is meant to be eaten in a single bite. Unlike most sushi restaurants in America, the chefs prepare the fish for nigiri sushi/sashimi thin and tender. This is how it is in Japan! Not the chunky block of fish you usually get. Sure, you feel like you are getting more value for your dollar but the whole idea around Japanese cuisine is balance, taste and esthetics. Too much fish overpowers the delicate flavor of the seasoned rice. Either way, their sushi is always fresh and delicious and creative. While cream cheese is not widely used in Japan, you can still get your Americanized sushi if you want it so you get a nice balance between authentic and neo-cuisine. I highly recommend any of their nigiri options (slice of fish on top of a bite of seasoned rice). We've tried a few of their rolls too and were not disappointed. My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu Ramen. It is sort of off-menu; you have to request it. And it is amazing. The broth is a rich pork broth, made from boiling pork bones for literally hours and hours. The noodles are tender with a wonderful chewy-ness to them and the garnishments are wonderful. Takes me back to my childhood, slurping soup out of the bowl from a tiny shoppe in an alley, steaming my face in the rich aroma of pork. A recent trip to Japan reminded me of just how much I love that dish and Hana does it up right. In fact, they've won awards for their Ramen! Best in Arizona! They also have some of the best Tempura available! Tender, light and delicious. I have yet to have a greasy tempura dish set before me from Hana. Try their Agedashi Tofu - Tofu squares battered, deep fried and then served with a light tempura sauce poured over. The batter turns gummy (in the best possible way), the tofu is piping hot (as in, be careful!) and the flavor is delicate and comforting. Oh! And the Hamachi Kama (this is the collar of the Yellowtail fish) is out of this world. Broiled perfectly so that the meat has a nice char but is still tender and moist. Served with a traditional ponzu (soy-citrus) sauce. YUM! (I'm making myself hungry!) Other traditional Japanese dishes are offered from their \"Japanese Menu\". It isn't always handed to you at the table. Sometimes you have to ask for it. Most of the items found on this menu are visible on the chalkboard above the sushi bar too. Be sure to try them! They're terrific. I recommend the Takoyaki (little balls of seasoned dumpling, stuffed with cooked octopus and then topped with Kewpie Mayonnaise and other delicious toppings) and the cold soba (cold buckwheat noodles that you dip in a subtle soy/ponzu sauce.) Wonderful in Summer and surprisingly hearty for such a light dish!. Their main dinner menu features steak, chicken and lobster prepared in their own Hana style. It's pretty yummy but I admit that I tend to stick to the more traditional stuff. Price-wise, they are within the typical range for a Japanese eatery. My husband and I typically spend around $50-60 for dinner but he eats a LOT of sushi so... The staff is always friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. The place really has good food so don't be surprised if there is a wait. It is a small place (they are expanding soon) so there are a limited number of tables. But they turn their tables around rather quickly so typically your wait is not longer than 30-40 minutes on a very busy Friday evening. This is a BYOB establishment. You bring your beer, sake or wine and they'll uncork it for you and provide fresh glasses. My only complaint (and this is entirely a ME thing) is that it can get rather loud in there. I'm accustomed to the quiet atmosphere you find in Japan but not at Hana. I'm sure it is just because so many people are talking so enthusiastically about how delicious the food is! Footnote: My daughter is deathly allergic to shellfish but loves sushi. I like that this restaurant routinely asks about food allergies every time we order and they are careful to keep shellfish well away from her order so we can all enjoy without having to worry if we'll have to cart her to the ER!\n",
      "I used to love this place but now we go more out of habit. We got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $30 on a regular spicy tuna roll, a specialty roll and side of steamed rice. $30 seriously? And the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost. Looks like Hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing. A sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $1.50 charge on each bill \"given the recent economy.\" I find that pretty unbelievable. Anyways, the food is generally pretty good. One of my favorites is their Hana salad although I was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix. Again with the cut-backs. Don't get me wrong. I like Hana alot but I think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other Asian spots.\n",
      "Worse sushi ever. It was not constructed well and the customer service was awful. We waited 20 minutes to get seated and the restaurant and the place was empty! The food came out before they even brought out the water. Would never recommend this place to anyone.\n",
      "Was nice felt welcoming service was good Speacially sense it was our first time trying takoyaki in there we all love it\n",
      "Can I say yum? Friends introduced me to this restaurant last week and, even though I don't eat much fish, there were plenty of delicious options!! Everyone raved about the sea bass and salmon sashimi. The fried oyster appetizer was crispy and tasty. Also loved the tofu appetizer -- delicately fried chunks of soft tofu in a soy broth. I love the old school boats for serving the sushi. My favorite option was the spicy tuna roll, which was actually spicy and not slathered in mayo like most sushi bars in town. It's BYOB, and they don't have a corkage fee. I'll definitely be going back!\n",
      "I love the fact this place is BYOB. The portions are large and the prices are decent. Overall I would say this is the best bang for your sushi buck. It is small so it can get crowded fast, but we've always had good service.\n",
      "Wonderful sushi bar. Love the byob! Get the yellow tail collar if available, it's a must try. Hana roll is very good. They had fresh toro last time and it was great.\n",
      "First time here. Remember BYOB. I know Sakana and consider them the gold standard. In comparison I'd say the food was OK but some of the portions, for the money, were skimpy. Especially for the price paid. I'd go back to Sakana before going back to Hana.\n",
      "This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =) The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers. The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend. They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect. They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit. The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way. If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing! Cheers and keep up the good work at the place. FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.\n",
      "My friend and I had dinner here and we enjoyed it. They don't seat you until your entire party is present so I did have to wait. It's a small, cozy restaurant with tables for 3-4, for 2, and seats at the sushi bar. We ordered the vegetarian gyoza as our appetizer and two cups of miso soup. We also got the Philly roll and Las Vegas roll, and the former came out first out of all the food. I love a classic Philly roll, can't go wrong with cream cheese and salmon. The Vegas roll was okay, I'm just not a fan of the deep fried rolls. The soup was excellent, simple but satisfying. And the appetizer was pretty good as well. They brought us more pickled ginger when we asked, since we like that stuff a lot. Good service, they are fast and efficient at refilling water and clearing off empty plates. Partly because the place is so small and they were getting more customers. Once we paid our bill, we felt that we had to leave because groups of two were waiting and there were no empty tables for 2. Still a great place to check out and I liked the authentic feel of it.\n",
      "Always friendly professional service, great sushi, always consistent, affordable, great vibe, love byob!\n",
      "Hana is worth for waiting even though we were waiting for almost an hour! The food came fast that help our hungry stomach and also delicious. I personally love their special menus (mostly wrote in Japanese) that hard to find at other restaurant in town.\n",
      "Hana has been one of the restaurants in our bucket list. My husband and I had the opportunity to go here. I really wanted to like this place but just bummed and came home unhappy and unsatisfied. We ordered gyoza, ginger pork lunch bento, salmon terriyaki lunch bento and a volcano sushi. Total bill was about $39 and some change. The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is. Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it. Overall, it was an underwhelming and unsatisfying lunch. I wish we have gone somewhere else. Not going back and can't recommend it.\n",
      "HANDS DOWN - the best sushi in Phoenix (maybe the planet - LOL). Small, yet intimate; creative and innovative, original and authentic WITH an AMAZING customer experience. THIS IS IT! Fish is fresh, plentiful and beautifully arranged. Bring your own wine makes this dinner down right \"cheap\" without cheapening your night. I rarely get anything \"bold\" (for me its the safe nigiri and sushi and roll options), but for those with a wild side, it seems they have you covered. If you plan ahead, arrange for a Shabu Shabu dish (just had that). I think its a 24 or 2 day notice, but the dish is so much fun and the beef melts (literally) in your mouth.\n",
      "I was very happy this time when I went to Hana. They have the wild salmon back, which is SO amazing! The place is small and fills up fast on any given night. I love that you can bring your own beer wine and saki.\n",
      "Love me some Hana. Seriously great quality sushi and BYOB. It doesn't get better than that. Period. The service has always been great for us and they do a great job explaining what's freshest and new to try. It's so neat that it's in our neighborhood and we can wander on over with a bottle of wine and stumble on home with full, happy bellies.\n",
      "After all the love poured out to Hana I decided to hold back my initial impression and give it another shot. I made sure to order a wide variety of items to make sure I captured the gist what they were putting down. First up: Miso Soup Very good flavor lots of seaweed, tofu, and seasonings. 2nd: Tuna Tartare Thinly sliced, a little smokiness, a little acidity but a bit disappointing overall. It was lacking the pop I look for in this dish. 3rd: Octopus balls These were interesting. Deep fried octopus with some mayo and a light sauce. Good flavor but the cold middle just didn't work for my palate at all. 4th: Shrimp and Veggie tempura Perfectly breaded tempura. Light crisp and tasteful. Only knock was the dipping sauce was too simple and plain 5th: Phili Roll It's hard to make a really bad or really good Phili roll. This was just as good as any in my book. 6th: Tuna sashimi Unimpressed with the freshness, mouthfeel, and color. Expected much better pieces from such a highly regarded sushi joint. Hana has a good ambiance. Service started out good but kind of faded midway thru. The price was average to high for the fare. I understand lots of people love them and as much as I wanted to be in on that love fest I'm just not one of them and I am okay with that. As overall both visits were just okay for me. Wasn't great...wasn't bad...just really okay. It is hard to see me giving them a third chance unless I am really craving ok sushi...\n",
      "I had a craving for sushi and a friend who wanted to try this place because a friend of his is a chef here. It was the perfect combination! Since it was a Friday night I suggested we get there early-ish to try and get a table quickly so we arrived around 5:30. The place is pretty small so most of the tables were full but we managed to get seated right away. My friend decided that he was going to order everything so I knew dinner was definitely not going to be some Philly rolls and fried rice. We started out with seaweed salad which I actually really liked. The flavor was really good with the sesame seeds and some lemon. Next was the sushi, we had the Alaskan roll, Spicy Tuna, Volcano roll and some Sea Bass nigiri. The Alaskan and Spicy Tuna were good, the Volcano roll was awesome with it's spicy sauce nicely crusted on top and the Sea Bass was simple and delicious. After that it was time for me to try Oysters for the first time. Personally I wasn't a big fan but that has nothing to do with Hana and everything to do with just my personal preference. I could tell the quality was good and they didn't taste gross, I just discovered that Oysters aren't my thing. Now at this point we were pretty full but the chef my friend knew walked by and told him to get the Razor Clams and/or the Tako Karaage. Neither of us knew what the second one was so we asked and discovered it was fried octopus head. As soon as he told us that I knew that's what my friend was going to order. I'll admit I was a little nervous because I was picturing something with eyeballs coming out onto the table. Luckily when they brought it to the table it was cut into strips so it looked completely harmless. We drizzled some lemon over it, took a deep breath and took a bite. After about 2 seconds we looked at each other in amazement because it was DELICIOUS!!! I'm talking so good my mouth is watering just remembering it right now. Octopus has a tendency to get chewy but this had a texture like steak! The flavor of it was amazing as well. The lemon juice gave it just the right balance of citrus and whatever they marinated it in before frying it was perfect. Definitely the highlight of the meal. For desert we asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hana An Mitsu which is aloe vera with fruit and red bean paste. I wasn't quite sure about eating aloe vera as I associate it with putting it on my skin for a sun burn but we decided to continue our adventure of trying new things and get it. It came out almost like a soup, there were big chunks of the aloe, a couple strawberries, some mandarin oranges and the chunky red bean paste all in a liquid of some kind. Neither of us were really big fans, the aloe chunks were just too big and overpowered the rest of it. Overall though the meal was one of the best I've had. The quality and flavors of the food was excellent.\n",
      "Ate here months ago. Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue). One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?) I should have just ordered another serving of this! Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given. I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried! Pretty sad, I know. I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!\n",
      "Fantastic authentic japanese place. Tried a variety of sushi and they were all well done. The amaebi was especially memorable. A touch on the pricy side, but it was worthwhile. Actually pricing is odd.. i've seen amaebi for $10+/2 pieces, it's $6 here. but Aji is like $5.50/2 pieces in seattle is like $10 here. must be due to fish availability.. Oh take note. no alcohol here - BYOB only. if you want a beer, u must bring it with you.\n",
      "Their seating policy is ridiculous. 2 people can only sit at a 2 person table. Recently had 3-4 groups of 2 waiting with multiple empty tables that seat 4. Never heard of a restaurant that is willing to loose business for an absurd policy like this.... And the staff is rude about too.\n",
      "I LOVE this place! I've been here a handful of times now, for both lunch and dinner. Everytime I've gone, the staff has been super friendly and the sushi is terrific. When it first opened, they used to bring out all sushi orders on those big boats, which I found kinda funny because sometimes there would only be two orders on there but they'd still make a huge presentation out of it. They don't seem to do that anymore, at least not with the smaller orders. I kinda miss that. Maybe they don't have enough boats or something. ;)\n",
      "Excellent authentic Japanese food! Sushi is fresh, the ramen is like the ones in Japan, and the service is good. I've been coming here since 2007. I get take out on weekends when I know there will be a wait to get a table. If dining in, get there before 6 on the weekends. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Hana is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Their fish is always fresh and they even provide a list of where/when the fish arrived. Surprisingly, a lot of locals are unaware of this gem. I feel like people want to keep it a secret because it's just that good! I recommend Hana to everyone asking for sushi recommendations. I've been to Hana dozens of times and have spent 3 birthdays there. I always order the volcano roll no matter what. It's so delicious. Baked to perfection! The spicy tuna roll is delicious as well. Honestly, anything on the menu is great. The staff is always helpful and they never get annoyed even after asking a millllion questions. I love visiting Hana. The one thing I truly miss in Phoenix. Ps it's BYOB. Doesn't get much better.\n",
      "Ignore most of my previous review. Went here Saturday. Place was hopping but food and service were excellent. Brought an extremely picky foodie friend visiting and he loved this place. Loved the dumplings, toro sashimi, yellowtail sashimi and mackarel sashimi. What I didn't realize the last time I ate here when I spouted off about limited sushi selection, is that they have several sushi specials which more or less doubles their offerings. New favorite sushi place. Seriously, get over there!\n",
      "I visited Hana with friends on my recent visit to Phoenix. We had an awesome experience. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding - the fish was fresh as can be (despite being far from water) - and the noodles and salad were tastefully done. I've heard there's oftentimes a wait (they are small and don't take reservations), but we went after the lunch rush and didn't have a problem. Some of the best Japanese I've had!\n",
      "pssst. hey. don't go here. I want it all to myself.\n",
      "Great food, friendly service and you can bring you're own booze. The only issue I have is Hana is pricey, but the quality is good.\n",
      "Meh. Food is okay, but it's over-priced in my opinion. Most of the sushi restaurants I've been to are either a) cheaper b) have better food or c) both.\n",
      "We have visited Hana about 3 times in the past few months since moving to Windsor Square in Central Phoenix. The location of Hana is perfect and parking can be found quite easily. ** Just an fyi - They have recently applied for a Liquor License and we were informed that during the process, they are not permitted to be a BYOB business. The sushi is always fresh, good portions and attentive service from everyone. Go early or later to avoid standing around watching everyone eat. They do have a small outdoor patio, it was too cold for us though.\n",
      "I went to Hana last night and many nights before that. I have never been disappointed with Hana. Usually amazed. The chefs and staff are great at what they do. Hana uses fresh garnishes that I haven't seen in other sushi bars in town. Pickled wasabi is one of them. They accent with little ingredients that make the food and presentation so much better and interesting. The fish is out of this world. We give chef Kojisan the option to create a dinner for us (my partner and I) and what comes out from behind that bar is natural goodness enhanced by a master's creative touch. They know us at Hana. We get the rockstar treatment along with good suggestions and samples of something new on the menu. We are usually blown away. We had the ramen noodles last night for the fist time. Wow!!! That pork was incredible. For the first time we tried the Kobe beef sashimi. Not bad. Not bad. The staff at Hana are super friendly. They are always wearing smiles in that busy atmosphere. There are seldom new faces within the staff. The employees stick around. It must be a great place to work. It is a fun environment. Hana does it right. In all aspects.\n",
      "I had such a great time at this place both times i went. The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister. The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place. Once i walked in my excitement grew. The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side. Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly. We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri. They even had Uni! i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason. Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh. Their yellowfin was just amazing! My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good. I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic. This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.\n",
      "Finally we found an authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix!! We moved to Phoenix from California and as Japanese Japanese I was sad that I cannot have a good Japanese meal for a while but now I found this restaurant and I am so happy:) One of the owner was so friendly and very nice. She even gave us free Toro(fatty tuna) for a service!! Food is excellent and potion was big!! I will definitely go back again and again!! Thank you!!\n",
      "Very friendly staff!, but this review only applies to the food, since we got it to go. Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad ( so it should have been hard to screw up, right?). The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasn't bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid $8.00 for something I couldn't eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad. We ended up throwing everything out. It's obvious our first time will be our last.\n",
      "Hana was my first experience with Sushi and it was good, but now that I've tried other sushi places I'm convinced this is not the best but its pretty good. Their presentation is very good, always very friendly. The only problem I would say is that its so small. If the people that sat down in the table bext to you are too loud then you might not enoy your meal so much. Its like your part of their conversation now, and of course you might be waiting for a while. They should really think about opening a bigger location.\n",
      "Fresh and tasty. I had the shrimp ramen noodle. Baked salmon sushi roll was amazing. Less one star since the shrimp was initially missing on my plate. service was also a bit impersonal. had to wait for our check for an excessive amount of time before we finally walked up to the cashier so we could leave. Good food tho.\n",
      "Disappointed... I had heard wonderful things about Hana and I was excited to try a sushi place near downtown Phoenix. Maybe my hopes were too high, but the sushi was just okay. I'd rather drive far away for good sushi than stay close to home for mediocre sushi.\n",
      "The first time I went to Hana I really enjoyed it. The Hana Bento Box was great as was the tempura ice cream. The second time I went was o.k. - the spicy tuna was average, but the volcano roll was awesome! I think the trick to Hana is sticking with their House specialties (like the volcano roll and Bento Box - and asking the waiters/waitresses what they recommend.\n",
      "Recently we hit up the sushi bar with Kiltlifter in tow to indulge in some Japanese Wagyu beef. I caught a tweet about it and just could not resist. It was insanely good as you might imagine. A quick kiss over hot coals on your own personal chimney and grate, and I mean lightening fast to avoid over cooking the exquisitely marbled meat. Just a slight dip in the house made (yuzu?) flavored sauce it was very tasty indeed. Silky smooth fatty meaty five star territory goodness, yum. It became somewhat comical when other patrons got in on the fun as the joint filled with smoke from the fat hitting the hot coals. Some folks were just not meant to have this responsibility. Way too many people dead set on annihilating this premium beef by over cooking these wafer thin morsels. They most definitely needed professional supervision. Maybe at the very least you should be required to complete a simple questionnaire before they turn you loose on the good stuff. The heathens that we are we did somewhat of a surf and turf type dealio. We ordered several pieces of nigiri which we let the chef choose. No qualms about the fish quality, but I found some of the pieces were just too heavy handed with the crispy garlic tidbits. I love garlic, but this just overpowered some of the fish. Totally over gilded the lily, let the fish shine! So if you are not following on twitter, get on it!\n",
      "I've tried a lot of sushi places in Phoenix and I can confidently say that this is the best. While the menu is limited, they quality of the fish is the best that you can imagine in the desert. We ordered multiple types of nigiri and I think that overall the fish quality is good, but they need to work on their seasoning. The rice had such a faint vinegar taste, that with any strong fish, you couldn't even tell it was there. The fish slices were also not seasoned at all. I typically try a piece just as is to taste for quality and seasoning, but this was one of the first times, I really felt like I needed to add soy sauce and wasabi to all the fish slices. In addition, we ordered the sake steamed clams, the gyudon nabe and okonomiyaki. The sake steamed clams were excellent but we had to send the first one back due to them having way to much sand in them. The gyudon nabe was amazing! very savory with a light sweetness and very hot and filling on a cold night! Okonomiyaki was okay at best. My bf is a huge fan of okonomiyaki and this was made way to thick and wasn't very seasoned as well. The service was also extremely attentive and friendly. The employees there were very helpful with suggestions (sometimes too helpful) and just very friendly to talk too. I will def be back, and I wish they were closure to where I lived because its kinda of a drive to get here. Amazing sushi, prices are a little higher but its the best in a desert so its worth it!\n",
      "We LOVE this place! We went on a Saturday night during the dinner rush, were promptly seated and greeted. Our kids came with us and they were given a cute little boat with rice balls and won ton chips! So nice! My kids gobbled those up quickly :) We ordered nigiri sushi and a couple of rolls. The portions are always so plentiful and yummy! My 7 year old loves the miso soup and my 5 year old loves plain, cold tofu which isn't on the menu but they happily brought some out to us. I always get the iced green tea which comes in a can, its very good. The servers are so friendly and so nice to our kids. Thank you, Hana! We will be back!\n",
      "Its a little, family run, amazing place. Family friendly. Bring your own wine, beer or sake. They will chill it, cork it, no extra charge. But you just can't beat the food.\n",
      "Always good service, portions of fish, and the pricing is great!! The BYOB is nice too. They refrigerate your drinks and bring them to you. Can't beat that!\n",
      "For the whole story of my experience here refer to Aletheia's post (my sis). I wanted to put my two cents in that it was extremely over priced and the katsu was really really dry. As an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in Phoenix. Definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\\ good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that... Definitly not going back again...unless it is free.\n",
      "1. Got off to a bad start--tried to call but their phone only has an answer machine. No Email contact either. Hard place to find. Bad location and dumpy outside. I never would have gone in unless I had not seen them on yelp. Small--has less than 12 tables although bar stools as well. 2. This place has more employees than customers, so finding service is no problem. With the high prices they charge there is enough money to hire. One order of sushi and one chicken balls for $20. But you wouldn't pay any less in Snottsdale, and the food was first rate and you can bring your own booze, which cuts the bill down. 3. NOTE: they don't take reservations but this place is always packed. 8:30 on a slow weeknight, and few seats available. I will be going back, but not on a busy weekend. 4. Also--I have been around a while and can spot a gay/lesbian hangout a mile away. This is one of them--could tell by the male ear fashion and Hillary butch haircuts. Not that I care but if you do you might not like it here. My guess was correct for when i was leaving I saw a bunch of gay magazines in a rack. LOL\n",
      "I will always base my opinion of a sushi restaurant according to the freshness and taste of the saba mackerel sushi. Theirs is DIVINE. I mean, it was melting in my mouth. Sometimes you forget how REALLY fresh fish tastes because you live in the desert. Hana will remind you. It's pricier than some other places, but their menu is extensive and their specials are always changing. Expect about $20-30+ a person, unless you order off the lunch/dinner menu only... but why go to a sushi bar without ordering said specialty.\n",
      "A bit of good and bad all around -- expensive in comparison, but authentic Japanese food. Huge portions. Wifey has a tiny stomach capacity so we brought much of it home. She took a very long time to decide due to the high prices, and we almost left, when she decided on the ribeye. A good choice, the steak was amazing and full of awesome flavor. Though a bento box or a few rolls would have been nice, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was good with lots of delightful goodies in the broth. For drinks, though they don't serve alcohol you can BYOB. I asked for hot tea, and got a can of green tea soda and cup of ice. I ordered seaweed salad, and was brought a lettuce side salad followed by the one I ordered. Next an oyster shooter. It was $9 for one presented in a small dark bowl which arrived the same time as the main course, I paused a bit, being used to seeing them viewable in a clear shot glass. Nevertheless it was tasty. On to the service: Before entering the restaurant we were greeted then seated quickly. Parking was surprisingly plentiful given the small lot, we lucked out and got a place near the door. Quite attentive wait and sushibar staff, all appropriate pleasantries spoken in Japanese, respectful and honoring us. Though the room temperature was uncomfortably hot, overall nice experience. We're on a budget so could not splurge on things we really wanted to try. Would return again at a less busy time with lower prices and less heat.\n",
      "Meh, about says it. It was OK, the volcano roll was pretty good. The service was good but I just wans't all that impressed.\n",
      "I really like exploring restaurants within walking distance. This place has really good sushi, and I didn't mind the outdoor seating. Is not anything special but allows for a little more room than other similar sushi places. The staff was wire helpful and the hot tea was really tasty. The only drawback is that is a little pricey.\n",
      "Great food, decent service. The roast pork is honestly the best thing on the menu. One bite will make your mouth be filled with ecstasy. I had the Ribeye tataki salad and it was stupendous. It is a little on the loud side though.\n",
      "My long ramen journey is at an end. Hana has the best ramen in Phoenix. Their pork and miso ramens are both easily on par with legit ramen I have had in California. This venue is very hole in the wall, but their sushi is awesome, fresh and amazing. You can bring your own wine as well and the presentation is great. Friendly staff as well add to making this my go to for ramen in the Valley from now on.\n",
      "One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first. I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit. Her only request? Sushi! While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new. Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made. Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening. Too bad that isn't what we experienced. After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar. Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while. Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener? Me neither. Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer. Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered: Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had) Spicy scallop nigiri (good) Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces) Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch) Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'? Really?) The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent. Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought. It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave. Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price. No thanks.\n",
      "Exactly! Meh. I've experienced better. Maybe my expectation was too high after checking all good reviews and reputation of this place on yelp and some magazines. Foods; Pretty much every slice of sashimi was stringy even though it's called toro and very uneven surface - for Salmon, Halibut, and Tuna? maybe dull sashimi knife?! Yellowtail taste good but the sushi looking was not that appetizing Oysters were way too big and over priced Service was decent and attentive.. nothing super attractive or fascinating.. I'm not really motivated to drive back to this place anymore, so my final verdict of this place is \"Meh\"\n",
      "Wow, after having lived in Japan for many years I was so surprised to find such high quality food as this in Phoenix. Each item was spot on delicious. Maybe not the place for someone who wants the Americanized versions of sushi and tempura. But if you know you like Japanese then you are in for a treat.\n",
      "What the heck am I missing here? The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it .... I guess some people like it that way? I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time. Other people's review I trust give it more stars. I just don't get it.\n",
      "I tell everyone that likes sushi to go to Hana. It really is the best in the valley. The service is always beyond excellent. You can bring your own wine or beer. A few of my favorites are the cold soba noodles, the Hamachi Kama and anything with Uni. They have the most fresh Uni I've had in the desert. The nimono is also really delicious and different that other types of tsukemono or nimono I've had before. I always leave Hana with a smile.\n",
      "This place is crazy!!! You can bring your own beer or wine. Love it. plus the sushi is awesome and I mean awesome. lol\n",
      "This place is amazing!!! The service was fast, the staff is friendly and the sushi is amazing! The place is a bit small so come quick to get a table! Also, BYOB concept helps me save money on my bill\n",
      "Used to love this place, and still think very highly of the food, but the recent emergence of awful attitudes from the owners and staff has put them in the back seat. Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.\n",
      "despite having really good sushi, they bring out the plates SO FAST and (for us) in the wrong order. we got salad with the sushi, then entrees, then apps. i asked them to slow down because we literally did not have enough room on the table. we were told \"that's just the way it is,\" which was kind of annoying. an acknowledgment would have at least been nice, you know? but still, the sushi is good and prices are reasonable. next time, i would definitely stagger my order according to arrival preference, because they won't do it for you.\n",
      "Rarely have I had sushi as good as this. I went for the first time on 2/15/2013 for dinner with my husband based on the reviews I read here and elsewhere that this place was really great and was craving some awesome sushi. When we pulled up I was a little disappointed as it is kind of in a strip mall area that I am not familiar with. However, after eating the food, the place could be in the middle of a landfill for all I care. We had the Hana Pride roll, uni shooters, japanese mint leaves stuffed with tuna, a yellowtail roll, an order of tuna nigiri and the tuna tataki roll. We also split their ribeye steak with shrimp. I was amazed by how fresh and delicious the sushi was. Really interesting choices that were all different but each delicious in their own way. I highly recommend the Hana Pride even though it is one of the pricier menu options because it is really awesome and totally worth the money. Besides, BYOB saves you a lot. The only thing that we could have done without was the steak, not that there was anything wrong with it. The sushi was just so good that the steak was outshined. Service was also impeccable! They refrigerated our beers and sake and were great at clearing the plates on our very small table. Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Just have to give my favorite sushi place a shout out. We eat there several times a month and every time it is first rate. It is small yet accommodating. The seafood is as fresh as it gets in The Valley of the Sun. The menu variety makes you feel like you are actually in Japan. My favorite is the green mussels. Even for the unadventurous they are a must try. We have always had friendly, welcoming service. After a long day at work it is so nice to take our own bottle of wine and have the wonderful staff take such good care of us and treat us like family. Stop overpaying for priced sushi and Japanese food that is served at a mediocre chain. Get out and enjoy this locally owned neighborhood gem!\n",
      "The sushi is ok-good, not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded, noisy, bustling places then Hana is for you. The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you. However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching. So here is the low-down on what we had: Tempura - 2+ Bland at best Squid Salad - 3+ Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummy Spicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used to Volcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag! Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good. I just wish the Sushi was great enough for me to overlook all this petty crap but it just wasn't. Sorry.\n",
      "(Lyrics - The Outfield - Your Love ) Sushi's in Phoenix is far away Come around to Hana and talk it over So many dishes that I wanna try You know I like my sushi a little bit colder I just want some yakisoba tonight I'm going to Hana Japanese Eatery tonight I got so many reviews to get to Always got to write when I'm hungry You know I'd do anything for food Stay and eat and have a belly covered I just want some yakisoba tonight I'm going to Hana Japanese Eatery tonight Hana Japanese Eatery is located on 7th Ave. south of Bethany Home Rd. in a tiny outdated strip mall. At first glance, it doesn't look like much and out of all places a sushi joint is here! Needless to say once you walk in the place is cozy with a hip mom & pop feel. It's definitely dark in here, but that lounge cool feel is hot right now so I can't complain. I'm not a big sushi eater, but my friend ordered some and thought it was pretty good. I'll have to agree since I only took one bite. What I ordered was amazing! Ebi Yakisoba noodles they served here was wonderful. There was something about the sauce that they mixed. I asked the waitress, but apparently its chef secret. That extra sweet after taste left in my mouth is unforgettable, but I can only say it's similar to a kimchi sweetness without the spice. Definitely one of the best yakisobas I had in a while and that's what's going to keep me coming back since I can't figure out what's in that sauce! Darn the food gods! Why must to toil with my palates! - Enjoy!\n",
      "Stopped by this place with my mom on a whim while out shopping. It's really unassuming looking outside, but the inside is nicely set up and pretty relaxing atmosphere. They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc. I got the orange chicken combo and it was quite good, it was spicy and orangey and didn't taste quite the same as everyone elses' typical recipes. The egg drop soup was pretty good. I'll probably stop in here now when I go shopping.\n",
      "It's not better than SF China town but that's better than China itself! Best I have had on the west side of Phoenix tho and much better than Panda Express!!! Food served quickly and service is unparalleled! I will be back but next time with my family! So glad... Phoenix seems to be devoid of good Chinese food! FYI- food looks more greasy in photos than actually are!\n",
      "The food was delicious. Server was just right, did not really have to ask for anything. Best part they serve boba!\n",
      "The food here is pretty good and pretty cheaply priced for any type of Chinese food. I went here a few weeks ago on a date and loved the atmosphere, it was nice and quiet and wasn't insanely bright outside so it was a nice change from out doors. The only issue i had was that i waited like 15 minutes to pay for my food because the lady at the register was messing with the toothpick dispenser.\n",
      "I like this place a lot. They have the best fried rice and the prices are good. The staff was friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my take out order. I will go back.\n",
      "LOVE! This place! Best Chinese food place I've ever been to! Great service, fresh food, nice establishment and awesome ceiling!\n",
      "First time in for lunch. Clean dining room nice staff and generals chicken was really good. Excellent value. Give this a try!\n",
      "This place was great. The server (probably the owner) was so very nice and friendly. The food came out really fast and was delicious. We had chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice - portion sizes are large and there was lots of meat in both. The spring rolls were piping hot and had a good flavor. The prices are good and they have a large selection of dishes. The restaurant was extremely clean and had good atmosphere. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "This place is pretty good. I know there aren't many good Chinese places in Arizona, or many other good places at all, but this one was decent. I have ordered take out from here several times, and it was good. The service was good, portions were big, and the food was consistent each time I ordered. The mongolian beef was great\n",
      "Just had lunch there and it was really quite good. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was that it was fairly modern and quite clean...Including the bathrooms. The lunch specials are fairly priced. The soup was good, egg roll hot and crispy and the veggies crisp and fresh in the garlic shrimp entree. The fried rice was just OK. Suggestion to the restaurant: serve the egg roll on a separate plate so it does not get soggy while touching or sitting in the sauce of the main dish. Will definitely go back.\n",
      "Excellent food and service. The portion size were large and the price was reasonable. The atmosphere was quiet and the place was spotless. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a casual and yummy place to have excellent Chineese food. I will come back here again.\n",
      "Found this place on the fly while out running errands and starving. Owners were nice, especially Husband..Very courteous. Place was clean and we were offered water or a drink while waiting for our takeout. Food was very, very bland...very little flavor at all... Kung Pow had what I considered too many bell peppers and wasn't spicy (hot) even after I asked if it would be spicy enough. Cheese puffs bland. Eggrolls Bland. Portion sizes were Ok but sauces were much more runny than other places...and did I mention bland? our search continues....\n",
      "I recommend the Cantonese Noodles these are ala Monterey Park, Ca. True authentic Chinese cuisine\n",
      "I love AJK. Hands down my favorite spot for Chinese food. I like how when I order a shrimp dish they give me 12-13 pieces compared to other places that will give you maybe 5 or 6 and cut in half. Really good bang for your buck. I will say though I always used to order the Roast Duck and it seems like they changed the flavor or cook and it's just not the same anymore. They used to serve it in the sauce and now the sauce comes served on the side, just doesn't taste as flavorful. But aside from that, this will always be my go-to place!\n",
      "This place is amazing. As far as I'm concerned this is the best in the west valley. Generous portions and quality meats. The cheese puffs and spring rolls are crisp and very good, none of that haven't changed the dryer oil in 2 weeks taste. Chai boba tea! Well it's awesome. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is a serviceable, but not exciting, Americanized Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do for Chinese food in the Avondale/Goodyear area. My wife and I ordered the orange chicken meal, the Mongolian beef meal, and a small hot and sour soup. The meals seem to be a good deal to add several extras to an entrée for only a dollar or so. Choosing the meal upgrade trades out your white rice from the standard entrée for some lo mein noodles and some fried rice. In addition, you get a single vegetable eggroll and a single fried cheese puff. These extras add volume and variety to your meal without being particularly interesting or delicious. From a food-volume-for-price perspective, it is a good deal, but you shouldn't expect any of the extras to be special. The eggroll in particular was extremely subpar, As it reminded me of an eggroll I could have bought frozen and cooked at my own home. The cheese puff was delicious, but then again it's difficult to screw up fried dough with a lump of cream cheese in the middle. The \"fried rice\" really looks to be nothing more then some rice which was made brown by some kind of unremarkable sauce. The lo mein was similarly disappointing, there was very little to it other than noodles and some sauce, although the sauce did add a nice flavor. The hot and sour soup was one of the high points, as the broth was a deep rich brown with a little bit of thickness to it, it had a generous amounts of tofu cabbage mushrooms etc. and the hot and sour flavors were nicely balanced. My wife's orange chicken was tasty, but literally included nothing other than the chicken and the sauce. It did not even include the standard steamed broccoli to add a little bit of vegetable into the meal. There wasn't even the pretense of adding something healthy here, and the vegetables were sorely missed. The Mongolian beef was quite delicious but similarly unhealthy. It consisted of reasonably tender chunks of beef extremely large amount of sauce, and green onions along with slices of regular onion which had been stirfried with the beef. From my experience this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Mongolian beef. My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of variety on the menu. They were probably only about 10 different beef dishes, a handful of vegetable dishes, seven or eight seafood dishes, and the same number of chicken dishes. I couldn't find a single item on the menu with eggplant in it. What kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have eggplant and beef on the menu? There were a handful of Chinese/Thai offerings, but as someone who greatly enjoys Thai food, I would never risk ordering even a simple curry from a restaurant like this. So long as you're expecting cheap Americanized Chinese food, you will get what you pay for. I can see us returning to this restaurant for that purpose at some point, but not often. Make sure what you like to order is on the menu before going, because even certain standard offerings maybe missing.\n",
      "worst ever. Smoking everywhere. couldn't open windows while living there because of smoking and loud music. Nothing the management team can do about. When there were gunshots few months ago, no information was shared. and no follow-up. http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/33997076/las-vegas-police-detain-1-following-barricade Fortunately when it happend, I already left for work. But I heard about it from my friends not a single word from the management team. Hard to reach staff members.\n",
      "Living at Loft 5 was probably one of my best experience. Besides the fact that the units are so modern and luxurious, the property is always clean & the guys down at the security office are always on top of things. Any time I needed anything fixed in my unit maintenance were as fast as can be. Also my favorite is Bianca in the leasing office! She's awesome & she really helped me a lot moving in & also as I left this beautiful community. Neighbors are friendly & if I ever decide to move back to Vegas I will definitely consider moving back into Loft 5.\n",
      "Karen and the entire Loft 5 staff are amazing and very hospitable. They are always checking to see if wee are doing ok and extending a helping hand. The crew here is always here for our needs!\n",
      "Best place to be in Vegas. Location is great and the inside is super nice and spacious. Pools super clean! great in the summer time! Amazing room design (super clean look and the kitchens my fav). Never an issue w maintenance. Anytime I need something- Bianca or Karen would reach out right away. Would give more stars if possible.\n",
      "First off let me say that I should of TRUSTED past reviews. A few different negatives. Leasing agent was polite and not pushy but did not inform of many vital things that pertain to living at Loft 5 and the move in / approval process. HOA rules and regulations were not fully listed and detailed until after lease was signed. Move in due to these rules did not go smoothly at all resulting in 2 attempts at furniture delivery. Appliances are great when they work but they often do NOT! I have been greatly disappointed by the kitchen. Total service calls in a month 1x for stove 1x microwave 1x washer / dryer 3x dishwasher The cabinet trim is poorly constructed and often falls off! Elevators are slow and doors are outdated keyed design which makes entering building more tiring than need be. Garage floor is squeaky as cars drive over there is a harsh and loud screech which can be heard from my 5th floor unit Pool is kept semi clean but is very shallow and is only good to splash around in when in direct sun. BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that every rule is slighted to make the HOA money NOT actually correct an issue. Many people have dogs and there is often barking and noise disturbances. Take your money elsewhere and spend less!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I lived at Loft 5 for several years. We were initially attracted to the convenient location and the stylish architecture. We remained residents of Loft 5 because of the respectful and friendly staff and residents. This is the perfect place for young professionals who want both a social environment and privacy. The units are beautiful with high end appliances, the maintenance staff is wonderful and responsive and the management team is always courteous and accommodating. As all units are adjacent, tenants must be realistic in their expectations. Yea, you will occasionally hear your neighbors, but it's minimal and much more of a private community than other reviews imply. After having lived in similar apartments and condos throughout the Las Vegas valley, this is by far the best option. Highly recommend. We moved to California, otherwise we would have stayed here for longer. If you're considering moving here, please go see Bianca, you won't be disappointed!\n",
      "Love where I live and the management team does a great job to ensure your satisfied with your place. very convenient area located on South Las Vegas blvd. I moved in over a year ago and I plan on staying for a long time!\n",
      "Did not end up choosing this place to live as it is not as close to the fun as I would like. But it is a gorgeous property and I got a great tour from a female staff member who I can't remember her name (think it was Karen). She was wearing sky high heels and I was all how do you not cry all day? And she was all, I feel short without them. Impressive lady. Anyhoo, check them out, they are really modern and nice!\n",
      "Been living here now for about 7 months, I was going to review it sooner but I wanted to give it a fair review. I will start with my actual unit. I LOVE my loft. The Wolf appliances and design of the unit is great. We furnished our own washer and dryer as if you get the one management provides it's a cheap connected stackable that washes 2 pairs of jeans if your lucky - not too happy about that especially when paying $1350 a month for an apartment. When moving into the unit be prepared to clean your unit. Whoever they have preparing the units doesn't do the best job i.e. floors will need mopped possibly steamed cleaned, will need to wipe down doors and windows cabinets etc. I consider these little things but when commanding the rental rates they do you would think it would be done right. Maintenance here has been the biggest issue for us and seems to be the common problem when talking to my neighbors. We submitted a work order for our blinds and no one bothered to come even a week later. We eventually fixed it ourselves. The people working in the office are great and are available for questions. Overall it has been a great experience and we will be renewing our lease. Would have given a higher star rating but I think the maintenance issue needs to be addressed.\n",
      "This place is all bout blessing and curses. I like lots of things about it...then again, the very same things I like are also the things I don't like. Does that make sense?! 1. It's openness. LIKES - it has that open feeling which you can decorate clean and modern. Super minimalistic. DISLIKES - there are no doors! I get the whole loft thing but, I always tell my friend that \"if someone breaks in, you'd be screwed...no where to hide!\" 2. Security. LIKES - the area in general is kinda shady so, security at the gate is always a plus! DISLIKES - uhmm... how do I say this? THE SECURITY IS WEIRD! Like normal/social ppl, I made small talk with the guard while he rang my friend; and I swear to you, the guard showed me pics on his phone, told me (almost) his whole life story, AND let 3 cars in ahead of me. I wanted to dieeee; how do you cut someone off in mid-(whole life)-conversation to tell them, \"haaay, I don't know you nor do I care about your life; just-let-me-in!\" 3. GYM. LIKES - open 24/7 with weights, pool, jacuzzi, steam room, usual gym equipment. DISLIKES - lots of equipment but, small.\n",
      "This is a tough review to write. I absolutely love the apartment itself- the size, the openness, the amenities. The common areas are great (pools specifically) and some neighbors are friendly. What I don't like, and the reason for so few stars are the following: - Multiple car police activity outside or inside the complex at least once a month and gun shots coming from somewhere in the neighborhood occasionally - The HOA for Loft 5 is horrendous. As someone who leases, it feels like the HOA is trying to make renters get tired of jumping through hoops and move out. They seem to have become much worse in the past few months. I've actually considered moving and have told friends who want to move here to hold off.\n",
      "Brief yet terrible experience...I considered moving here because I know someone that lives there and has been advocating for them for months. I'll keep it simple, if you're going to live here...stay away from pattie. Although I am grateful for her incompetence(since I love where I live now) I just want to save you the stress. I heard great things about Karen, who I unfortunately didn't get to work with but let's just say it's been over a month since I applied and I had to do the following up. First she claimed she didn't update me because I was out of town for work, then when I responded to her email asking what the next step was she ignored me from there on our..however I responded to an ad an hour later and she emailed RIGHT back(she didn't know it was me of course) Considering the fact that I had a similar experience upon move in at my last place of residence I knew that was a red flag so I gladly took my business elsewhere. I knew she was in the wrong industry from the first day I toured Loft 5 but I wanted to give her a fair chance because the property was the closest to what I had at that time but I am glad I followed my instincts.\n",
      "I lived in this place for 10 months.. The noise between the units is unbearable. I wrote emails, daily phone calls over the course of a month. I was unable to sleep in my own bed. There was nothing done to assist me so I had not choice but to move out!! So upon my move out I was told the my deposits (which were $1350 plus $500 in pet) we would just make it a wash. When I called them over a month ago and made sure I had a zero balance I was told yes I do! I just now got off the phone with a debt collection company whom is telling me I owe $635 (if that's true then they owe me change). I left my place spotless, had a very good walk throu, those office people are horrible and don't know what's what and don't take care of the renters! The place looks nice and that is it!!!!!!!! Also when I lived there cops were called to the property almost daily. I have been told numerous times that pimps and prostitutes live there. I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE!!\n",
      "Love living here. The management is awesome at responding the maintenance come in a timely manner and the facility is very quiet. Haven't bumped into too many of the neighbors as everyone seems like they are on a different time schedule. But so far we love the location as well as the lofts itself!\n",
      "I am a former resident of Loft 5 going through a law suit with them currently. I was living there for over 6 months and in that time my car was vandalized, packages stolen from the mail room, items stolen from my car, pot smoking/drug dealing neighbor and so much more! ***Do any of the former residents or current residence have the management office email address? I If you are looking to rent here its a beautiful community but be prepared to be highly; dissatisfied with customer service. Its pretty much as if there is no management, they completely ignore their tenants!\n",
      "Do not rent from this place, especially if you have animals. They would send me letters everyday for my gate which kept my dog from jumping off the balcony. The maintenance men would walk into my unit all the time unannounced . The countertops will stain. All I remember is mopping the floors because they show every dog hair or dirt. We couldn't take living at this expensive crappy place anymore and I lost my job I even went downstairs and asked them what I can do if I lost my job about the rent they just said I have to wait till my contract is over. Sure enough the day my family helped clean the apartment all day they tried to blame me for every single scratch carpet tear in the hallway like other people in the entire unit didn't do that just because one of my dickhead neighbors said he saw my husband barely scratch the wall because the jerk wouldn't move out of the way for him. So the office lady said that all the damages that I didn't even do were going to be on my last bill! My neighbor said that they charged her for carpet lines in the hallway because it is thin carpet and shows lines from moving in furniture. The elevator was always out of service so I constantly had to carry my groceries up the stairs and then again when I walked in my unit because my kitchen was upstairs. My husband went off on the lady who tried to charge us for things in the hallway we didn't do and even though they have maintenance men who would have fixed them all easy me and my family just used a magic earaser to fix the scratch on the wall and vacuumed the hallway. Seriously this place is a joke. My neighbor was a spoiled brat who was 18 and drove a hummer who threw parties all the time and would ring my doorbell at 2 am all the time when I had to go to work the next day I had to stay up and call the cops on them. The cops just said we are not coming out again and the girl kept throwing parties and my door bell was always ringing day and night from immature kids. I asked the security guards to help me with the problem they could care less. They also only gave us only one parking space so I had to always park in guest parking where people would hog 2 spaces for weeks and the office again did nothing about it. They should spend more time helping there renters then walking around taking pictures of non sense and sending out hate mail I also would get letters to keep my dog on a leash. The office girls also talked crap to my parents and said we were getting a house and didn't feel sorry for us having to leave and then my mom yelled at her and said that I lost my job and then they said I should have asked for help when I did ask them to help me a month before I moved out. I had to pay $1000 to move out a month early plus I lost all my deposit money just because I couldn't stand to live one more day in that horrible place.\n",
      "Love this place. So quiet and peaceful. The staff (Bianca and Karen) have really gone above and beyond to making loft 5 a community that everyone can feel safe in. We are a family of 3 with a 6 month old and I was a little worried that Loft 5 might be a little fast paced (being on the s strip) for a new baby but after being here a few months , I have never felt safer. If you have ever heard anything different please try them to find out for yourself. LOFT 5 IS HOME!!!!!!\n",
      "Just moved out of loft 5 due to relocation and I have no complaints! All the staff we're always very friendly and extremely helpful. If I needed something fixed in my place they always fixed it in a timely manner. I never had problems hearing any of the neighbors and the place is well insulated so electricity bill was never to high. Also it only took a week and a half for them to refund me my deposit. No hassles trying to get my deposit money :)\n",
      "Was looking for a nice place to move so I completed the online form to setup an appointment to see an apartment. No call back so I called and left a message, still no response and that was two weeks ago. I really wanted to check out loft 5 but you need an appointment but no one calls back and I'm not going to keep calling when I am the customer. I found the Lofts at 7100 and will be moving there. I heard loft 5 was nice, but oh well. One star for the lack of follow up which equals poor customer service. Can't comment on the property.\n",
      "Customer service is the best I've ever seen.. Unfortunately I didn't know it at the time since it was my first apartment.. Since Loft 5 I have lived at two different luxury apartments in Denver, and a high rise in San Jose and I've never felt more comfortable and taken care of than at Loft 5. My friend and I moved in at the beginning of November and found out we had to be relocated for work, the manager at Loft 5 Bianca was incredible in helping us and our company make the transition. The staff represent the luxury apartment complex well, Officer Kim was the most professional security officer I've encountered and you can tell they enjoy being apart of the community!! Last but not least loved the community mixers, where the best luxury apartments host events together at clubs or pool parties, always a fun time! Don't take it for granted you won't find them most anywhere else! Highly recommended 5/5 stars Customer service Mixers Aesthetics Timeliness of maintenance Security\n",
      "After living here for a year I can say I am a fan of many things this community has to offer. I can also say that I have a severe dislike for a few things about the property. First, the good stuff! 1. The property manager is amazing. Bianca has been extremely understanding and helping. All the emails that I have exchanged with her have been professional, responsive, and kind. I cannot say that about another team member there, but that will come later. 2. The units are nicely appointed with lots of space and very open layouts. You have very nice appliances and cabinetry. Anyone that has come to visit has always complimented them. The layout is great and pretty functional for what it is. I really enjoyed it. 3. The property itself is very nice and well taken care of. The maintenance team responds quickly and they very what you need fixed and take care of it. 4. All of my neighbors that I have met have been very friendly and offered to help out with bringing groceries up or just holding the security door open. I think I met one person who was an absolute detriment to humanity but other than that the people are pretty awesome! The bad: 1. THE SMELLS. I know this is something that I cannot blame the property for but oh my sweet baby Jesus. Someone down the hall I live in loves to smoke weed like Snoop himself lives there. The whole place reeks of it. It is kind of embarrassing when people come over and go \"WOAH HOLY DRUGS\". Definitely not my favorite thing. Now, one thing to take into mind is that this was just my building and my hallway. The other hallways and buildings could smell completely different. I've only been in one other one during a tour and it was fine. So take this with a grain of salt. 2. The people above my unit must train elephants or something. They stomp around like crazy. I cannot believe how loud they are. They either like to jump rope at 11 at night or continuously jump from the top level into a kiddie pool on the lower in a belly flop contest. I am not sure and frankly I hope they fall down the stairs for as loud as they have been. The units themselves have pretty decent sound proofing and insulation as well, so that just baffles me. 3. Guest parking is a hassle. First, getting the guest to the parking is a little rough. The security at the front, while nice, is kind of annoying to have to call down any time someone wants to come visit. Once they are in, they need to locate a spot. The problem with this is that there is a lot of resident parking and very little guest parking. Yet the residents still want to go and park in the guest parking. I think some of them just can't read and decide that it is a perfectly good space. 4. The shower. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND PUTS A FIBERGLASS DROP IN BASIN AND PLEXI SHOWER DOOR IN A FULLY TILED BATHROOM AND SHOWER?! Its like they went and ripped them out from Auntie Em's 12 year old mobile home and put them in the shower. They are a complete after thought. I know this is something with the original builder, but for being as nice as the units are this really brought them down a notch in my eyes. They could slowly replace the fiber glass and plexi doors with proper tiles and glass easily and over time but I doubt that is cost effective. 5. Patty in the leasing office never responds.You might as well email a ghost. That is why I was so thankful for Bianca. Also, the HOA sends out nastygrams but when you respond to them you never hear anything back. It took multiple phone calls and angry emails to get a point across with them and show that I was not in violation of anything. The security staff was on the line between good and bad. This was because there were a few guards that were absolutely awesome to work with. They knew who you were, remembered your guests, and were always cheerful and pleasant. Then there is the one security guard that is drunk with power and seems to think he is protecting the White House. He speaks to residents and guests with a horrible tone and talks down to people. It is a bad showing and initial impression for the property and he really should be replaced. I recommend Loft5 to people for the positives above. If you are fine with some of the negatives it definitely makes for a great place to live where you get a lot of value for your money. Most of the staff and neighbors are very friendly and always willing to help you out. The units are very nice and have a lot of great features and amenities. The only reason I did not renew my lease with the property was because of work. I wanted to move somewhere closer so I did not have to drive as far. I gave the property 4/5 because of the few things that are bad and within the properties control to be changed. I understand that the shower and the smell from some resident's units are out of the control of the property. However some of the staff and the guest parking that could be remedied is what earned the subtraction of a star.\n",
      "Can anyone tell me how much it is a month for the 3 bedroom 3.5 bathroom penthouse here???\n",
      "Buyers beware! I have been living here a little over a year and question every day why I moved here. There's not a month that goes by that I'm not calling the maintenance. Clogged drains, dirty vents, and and there is absolutely no installation in these unit. It seriously sounds like I live above Motor Speedway! There is constant barking stomping and and the neighbors music is so loud you feel like you're at the newest nightclub in Las Vegas. Loft 5 is only good for the easy access to the strip in airport and Aesthetics of the home.\n",
      "If I could give zero stars that's what they would have. I sit and write this review at 4:40am because ppl are playing music at 4:40 at the pool with no consideration . I have had to call metro on the neighbors there is parties all the time throw up in the elevators and this is a every other night situation which I have to call security on. If you want to pay over $1500 for a one bedroom with no sleep and inconsiderate people move here. As for me I'm moving as soon as this lease is up!!\n",
      "Relocated to Vegas and, despite the sketchy location of this building, was referred by another property manager to check out the \"modern\" 2 BR unit or Penthouse at the Loft 5. I pulled up to the security gate and no security guard was there to let me in. I waited at the gate for about 5 minutes, with a delivery truck and few cars waiting impatiently behind me, until the Guard came out of a group of young kids who were just hanging around the courtyard. I told him I wanted a tour of the property and gave him my Driver's License. He rang the leasing office and passed on a message to me that I \"need to make an appointment\"... ! Huh? The Business Manager stated in a response of 11/4/2014 that you \"welcome walk-ins\"... I was turned away and didn't bother making a future appointment. If the Business Manager hasn't passed down the proper policies and procedures to the on-site staff and they deal rudely and arrogantly with prospective tenants, I would hate to see how they act once they have my rent cheque every month ~ I will gladly take my business elsewhere.\n",
      "I really enjoy staying in this place. Very spacious apartments. 2 beautiful balconies. We have a pool, a jacuzzi and a beautiful gym. And it's so close to the Las Vegas Strip too. The hall is very clean and smells so good. I also love people who work for Loft 5, especially Bianca. So professional and accommodating.\n",
      "UPDATE: I have increased the star rating from a 3 to a 4. (6/11) Management contacted my husband later today (after the meeting with the HOA). They are going to help address my concerns with #7, and 8 (which I very much appreciate). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: I have increased the star rating from a 1 to a 3. A half hour after I made the below post, Loft 5 contacted my husband and said that they would like to meet with me and my husband to discuss the review (concerns) I had just posted on Yelp. This morning (6/11) I had a meeting with the manager for the HOA, she was very pleasant, and she said they are looking into/are going to look into addressing #3, 4, 5, and 6 listed below. My husband put in a request for someone to come and put caulk in our shower (so that mold won't grow in the shower/water damage issues don't occur right outside the shower). They are also going to fix the sink in the master bathroom. They are scheduled to come on Saturday (6/13). We still haven't spoken with the manager of the leasing department regarding #7, and 8. Though I expect that will occur shortly. However, I am hopeful that all of the below issues will be resolved in due time. I plan on increasing the rating further as the necessary improvements are made, however, I am very pleased to hear that they have already been working hard on trying to resolve the light situation in the gym. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (6/11) Me and my husband have been living at Loft 5 for the past few years. The first unit we lived in was nice, and was put together well. However, with our second unit, I have found out that they rushed to put it together. Here is the complete list of reasons why I would never recommend renting out a unit at Loft 5: 1.) The second unit we moved into (building #5) lacks quality. The bathroom counter in the master bedroom is falling apart. 2.) They used grout in the shower instead of caulk. Here is a link I found that goes further into why this is a BAD idea: http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/diy-rennovation-project-tip-grout-vs-caulk-when-and-where-to-use-what-200253 3.) One of our neighbors (I don't know who, but Loft 5 could figure this out since there are cameras) lets their dog poop on the carpeted stairs inside, and they just leave it there. This happens once every couple of weeks. I told Loft 5 about this after another incident of this occurring, (plus I was sick of looking at the smashed poop on the stairs every time I used them to walk to my unit), and they cleaned it up. 4.) I use the gym there regularly in the evenings after I get off of work. The lights turn off every 20 minutes....PITCH BLACK. Now, I use the treadmill, this means I have to pause it every 20 minutes and run over to the light sensor for the lights to turn back on. I told Loft 5 about this over a week ago, and they said they would take care of it. Nope....they still haven't taken care of it. 5.) The treadmills short out (completely turn off mid workout) after 40 minutes, and then, if that wasn't bad enough, multiple treadmills will short out if there is more that 1 person working out on the three (total) treadmills. They won't turn back on until another 20 minutes. 6.) The men's bathroom right outside of the gym is busted, so instead of fixing it as soon as possible, they posted a sign on the women's (stall) restroom, saying that it would act as a unisex bathroom until further notice. That was one month ago....enough said. 7.) They have raised their rent by $150 (unless you sign a year lease, which would only increase the rate to $100). For their horrible service, and the way they pinch pennies, this is shocking. 8.) There isn't enough parking spots, good luck in finding one if you got a unit that isn't a 2 bedroom (my husband gets the spot in the garage). Which means that I have to either try and find a \"visitor\" spot to park in, or I have to park on the sidewalk....good luck in finding any parking if someone is throwing a party :).\n",
      "I lived at Loft 5 for 18 months so I am going to give you a review that is a year and half in the making. First of all, most of these negative reviews seem to be based on personal opinions and issues that don't really reflect the overall experience and luxury you get with Loft 5. Everyone that lives here seem to be young professionals ranging from 26-40 and the environment is great and very professional. There was families with young children as well but I would recommend this place to any age bracket. My neighbors were all friendly and most of us became good friends. Walking down the hallway would usually involve a very warm greeting and great conversation. I moved here from San Francisco so I can start by saying the units are absolutely spacious and live up the luxurious name Loft 5 carries. Each unit is unique in its own way and as modern as they come. The bathrooms feel like you're at a 5 star resort and the kitchens make you want to learn to cook because of how nice the cabinetry is. Something important to me is water pressure and hot water when i'm taking a shower and let me tell you this place has both and they are amazing. the showers are great and you have a huge bathtub in each master bedroom. Karen and Bianca in the leasing office are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. From day one Karen was helpful and made sure all my requests and questions were answered in a timely fashion. Bianca would always be quick to get back to me as well with anything I needed and she is great! They know almost everyone by name and would always make it a point to come say hi if they saw you walking or were showing a unit to someone. If you want to move here just ask for these two, you'll be in great hands as they are very professional, genuine and will not waste your time. They were one of the reasons I extended my lease after my first year was up. My master bedroom faced the swimming pool, gym and bbq area and I never once had an issue with noise or people being loud. Sitting pool side usually involved a few people quietly relaxing and enjoying the sun. The bbq area is great as well, always clean and ready to go anytime you want to grill something. The gym is great for its size and super clean. Plenty of equipment for everyone and I never had an issue with waiting for a particular machine. The gym is big enough to where you don't need to have a personal gym membership so you can eliminate that cost from your monthly bills. Security is amazing and constantly watching out for everyones best interest. Most get to know you by name so they have that personal touch. People complain about them being strict but thats the point of living in a place like Loft 5. They ask for ID and call you to confirm you have a guest coming in, why would anyone complain about that? You're paying for everything, including a sense of great security and that random people won't be walking inside the complex or down your hallways. Plenty of parking for everyone. Each unit gets 2 parking spots, one garaged and one in the open. Again, lots of young professionals so people are very cautious about parking and being cautious about one another's vehicle. The location of Loft 5 is great as well. You're a few miles from the strip, shopping around the corner, town square and the outlets down the road. The area seems very safe and I never had any issues with anyone. Overall this place is great and I would recommend to anyone. Ask for Karen or Bianca, they will take care of you and ensure you get what you need!\n",
      "I have lived here for a year and I am done with this. Overall the unit looks great but too many concerns. Pros: 1. beautiful community 2. Modern looking unit Cons: 1. Leasing office have never taken care of your concerns. It is supposed to be smoking free building, there are a lot of people smoking in the hallway. If you are smoker, this is perfect place to live. 2. The insulation sucks. You will be able to hear all sounds between units, specially, you will feel like you are in the club. No matter you call leasing office, security guard, they will never handle it. 3. Appliances are so old. 4. When you move out, leasing office will charge you ton of stuffs that are not your responsibility. 1. $350 for cleaning fee no matter how you clean your unit 2. $400 paint touch up - According to Jay, this is standard. All tenants will get charged 3. $150 for additional carpet cleaning JUST DO NOT MOVE to LOFT5, even though this is good looking and modern designed apartment. Leasing office manager, Jay, he is so rude, very amateur, and no respect to tenants.\n",
      "I have a friend who lives in a top floor loft here and they are amazing! Absolutely beautiful apartments- sound systems, courtyards, and WOLF Professional Appliances.\n",
      "I've been here since September and I'm very happy with the property. Our unit is huge, with very nice modern appliances, cabinets, counters, floors, etc. Maintenance responds immediately for any minor problem that I have. They also maintain the grounds very well. I always see their crew cleaning, landscaping, changing lights, etc. They are really on it. Management has helped resolve minor issues with neighbors (noise, etc.) in a very timely manner. Whatever issues used to be at this property (based on other reviews) seem to have been addressed. Im looking forward to being here for a while!\n",
      "BEWARE..... Over the 12 months that I lived there I witnessed two different occasions when the SWAT team came and busted down the doors of two different apartments. The place is loaded with drug dealers and pimps, and management will lease these to anyone, and I mean anyone. They don't enforce any of the HOA rules, people pretty much do what they want. Pets pee on the carpeting throughout the buildings and people pile their trash near the trash chutes but are too lazy to put it in the trash. Constant hassles over parking, people just park where ever they want even though residents have designated spaces, and there's hardly any guest parking. The worst was, two nights before I moved out a guy threw his girlfriend off the 5th floor balcony and she landed near the guard gate instantly killing her. Interesting that none of these stories seem to be reported on the local news, but all of us residents know exactly what happens. Such a shame because the units are absolutely awesome! But just because there's security cameras doesn't mean you're safe.\n",
      "I loved living at Loft 5! I was there 3 1/2 years and don't have any complaints. The outside property and inside is constantly maintained. Maintenance was wonderful, if I ever needed help with anything they were always there the same day. I LOVED the staff, the women in the office are so sweet and helpful. Having a great staff like they do makes all the difference when living in an apartment. I've always lived in large homes and my apartment was designed so well it didn't feel like living in an apartment. I loved the open feeling of the place and the quality of the appliances, marble countertops ect. Once I saw the size of the bathroom and bathtub and that it had two balconies I was sold. I really liked how sound proof the walls are. A neighbor knocked on my door to apologize, her baby had been crying a lot and she thought I could hear it, But I never heard a sound from their apartment. I didn't see tenants too often but the few I did see were always very nice. The place being pet friendly was my main reason for moving there. They have multiple waste stations with doggy bags. I never heard dogs barking and the hallways are regularly steam cleaned, it never had the smell of a pet friendly building. It's a quick drive to the outdoor mall and the strip and all the grocery stores and shopping. I highly recommend Loft 5!\n",
      "The security at the front gate is a joke. Most of them will pretty much let anybody in and rarely do I get a phone call about a guest at the front gate. Then at night they only have one security guard so a lot of times my friends will have to wait at the gate for a while before they come back from their rounds. Recently they also decided to pulled out all the real grass and put in AstroTurf. It has made the complex look even cheaper. The gym and pool is open 24/7 so that is really nice but besides that I can't think of anything else that is nice.\n",
      "Building and Unit are cool. But ALL OF THEIR STAFF ARE NOT SO COOL. They love to saying that \"it's not our responsible\" Plus they have lady who works for their homeowener's association. She will treat you like her dog if you are renting.\n",
      "What a great experience living in law five apartments. You can't get a better apartment in town for the price. With gorgeous high ceilings and amazing kitchen and seconds away to the freeway I would recommend to anyone looking for in a luxury apartment. I also have to mention the amazing staff and the people to keep it really clean and maintenance.\n",
      "Beautiful apartment homes. The worst management I've ever seen or experienced. Originally for sale, the apartment homes then began to be leased over 1 year ago. The apartments caters to the HOA and their unending rules. The elevators are constantly in service mode and out of use (we live on the 4th floor which makes a load of groceries unbearable) and when elevators are in use they are covered in ugly brown pads. We rented places for less money with 1. more community events (there has been 1 in over a year, when we moved in they promised a yoga class in the yoga room, none yet). 2. More organization- scheduling and rescheduling of maintenance requiring tenants to be at home, elevators out of use 3. Friendlier management and 4. safer places (even though it is guard gated in the front there are no cameras surrounding the premises where the 2nd car or guest parking is, resulting in several car thefts). The only reason this complex get 2 stars, instead of 1, is because the apartment home itself is very nice looking: bamboo floors, sandstone tile, modern layout. There are many defects in the building though (cracks in drywall, corners of stairs exposed instead of covered, unsealed grout resulting in stains).\n",
      "Worst possible place to visit or live in. The security is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what kind of residential establishment runs there place like a damn prison. ID this ID for that... You ID people every time if you live here? Everyone knows exactly who I am at the security point. And it shouldn't matter what car I'm in. They see my face when I roll down the window. And I still have to give my ID??? I pay thousands of dollars in rent to be treated like shit by security. No... Can't wait to move away from this place is ridiculous. And no one should want to live in this prison. I pay way too much money to have such shit, disrespectful, be littleled by the security supervisors. Absolutely not. Do your self a real good favor and don't give this property the time of day. I promise you will hate living here. There's nothing great about Loft 5. I promise you that. This property looks nice from the outside. But on the inside its cheaply made. Everything breaks. They tried to make it look expensive to rob you of your money. The oven doesn't work properly. The fridge fell apart. The AC shuts on and off and doesn't work to digital standards. It's honestly junk. This whole place is awful. I feel like I'm constantly calling with maintenance... Drains are always clogged. It's enough stress trying to deal with all the problems in my apartment on the inside. Let alone having to deal with the trouble with security to get into the gate. Even though they know exactly who I am and where I live. (Apartment building and specific suite) I wouldn't be getting in unless I have my ID. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. No other place in LAS VEGAS is like this?? Way nicer places are NOT like this. It's honestly crazy. Don't move here again. It's just terrible all around. And I'm calling the head of management tomorrow about the way I was treated by a security supervisor. You don't talk to people that way. Especially people who pay thousands of dollars to live here. I can't tolerate being treated that way. Something is going to be said to upper management. And this yelp review was well needed!\n",
      "Loved here for over a year and I enjoy it. I absolutely despise apartments and prefer to live in a house until I checked this place out. The rent about as high as a house but you gain a lot. 1) open space! Plenty of room to hang my huge art collection. I love the wooden floors and the modern feel of the loft. It's great to host dinners with friends and family. I will say I've had a few issues with my modern appliances but they office repairs them immediately which is great. 2) I hardly see my neighbors. One of the things I hated about apartments is being bunched in with other people in buildings. Here I hardly run into people and when I do everyone is very polite. 3) I love the pool, BBQ, and fire pit area it's awesome to walk the dog light the fire and have a glass of wine. The bad thing is sometimes people don't pick up after their pets and there's poop laying around. Which that's annoying and rude. Plus sometimes you can smell the urine from the dogs in the grass area as well and the building. The office does clean it but sometimes it stinks. 4) Security is nice to have but I feel like these guys let who ever in without any real monitoring. I think they are there just to have. Overall I enjoy it here and don't have any complaints. I signed another lease and couldn't be happier about it. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a luxury apartment/loft.\n",
      "My favorite!! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu!! And their ceviche is so fresh!! Definitely the best ceviche I've ever had!! I'm always finding excuses to go back here\n",
      "Let's start by getting the 4 stars out of the way. The place was HOT, like really hot, like maybe no AC hot. This made for a slightly uncomfortable setting. Besides the temperature, I loved the place. Seemed like a mom and pop shop which I always like. So lets change it up and talk food. Wow.... It was tasty! Got the Papa a La Huancaina for an appetizer and it was amazing. I was disappointed at first because it looked so plain, just boiled potatoes cut in half smothered in a sauce. However, after that first bite I was hooked. These were amazing. Got a couple of their drinks, and they were pretty tasty as well, however I wouldn't get those again. My wife got Tallarines Verdes and it was amazing. The pasta was a great pesto green color, which had initially concerned me it would have too strong of a pesto flavor. It did not. The pasta was actually nice and creamy with a perfect amount of flavor. I got the Ceviche Mixto. This was outstanding. The assortment of seafood was great, the presentation was pretty, and the sauce was amazing. Packed full of a nice lime-kick with some spice. The waiter talked me out of going 'spicy' and went for 'medium' instead, which was probably a good idea. Medium had a nice amount of spice that built up, but was never too spicy to ruin or mask flavors. I would love to go back and try some other options the food was very good.\n",
      "Absolutely the best Peruvian food in town!! I have been hesitant to write this review because I wanted to be selfish and enjoy this spot without the huge crowds it can easily draw!! Not a place to rush in and out, it's place to be enjoyed with good company and great Pisco. Enjoy\n",
      "Hands down...the best Peruvian dishes in the valley. Ceviche (very spicy but it's a must!), tamale (yummy), and anticucho is the best is all (yes!!!) Pisco Sour with Maracuya - tasty ...friendly and clean - will be back soon.\n",
      "Love their food! Mixed ceviche is one of my favorites. Great place, very clean, good atmosphere and every one is very friendly. They know how to keep costumers coming back!\n",
      "Ceviche and Anticuchos are outstanding! The Maracuya sour or Passionfruit pisco is so delicious and refreshing. Excellent service. Highly recommend El Chullo\n",
      "Slow service but the food is great so prepare yourself with patience. Love the ceviches and papas rellena. Beef hearts are great.\n",
      "This is a small family run business. Everyone in the kitchen is related. The service was excellent, the atmosphere is great and the food was spectacular. Best Peruvian food we've had in AZ!! We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a great Argentinian red wine while my husband drank a Spanish lager. Both were delicious. After our meal the Owner stopped over to ask how it was. We talked for a long time and his wife came out from the kitchen to say hello as well. Super super sweet couple. We will definitely be back. This will be on the list of places we take visitors and I will be bringing customers from work as well.\n",
      "Excellent food. We got the cause rellena with chicken, ceviche and Lomo Saltado. The cause rellena was creamy and delicious. The Lomo Saltado was the best one I've ever had, the sauce is so goooood and the meat very tender. This was my first time here but I'll definitely be back for more!\n",
      "Don't let the location or the appearance of the outside of the restaurant deter you from experiencing truly great Peruvian food. The appetizer sampler is a great start. My wife and I especially enjoyed the seafood and of course the potato dishes. The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. If you have never tried Peruvian food then this would be a great place to have your first experience.\n",
      "Incredible service and authentic, fresh, flavorful Peruvian food. So happy this place is open! Amazing job so far. Love family spots!\n",
      "Excellent, authentic Peruvian cuisine. The lomo saltado was the best I've ever had, and the alfajor dessert is a must. The staff was so friendly and helpful as well. Highly recommend to anyone looking for some great Peruvian food!\n",
      "I came here with my parents (my mom is Peruvian). She gave it a 4.75 stars outta 5! Delicious food. Great service. Good pricing. I highly recommend this place if you want delicious Peruvian food!!!\n",
      "First time! Really enjoyed our dinner here. Good, authentic Peruvian food. Good service. Only issue is that it tends to be a bit loud. I will be coming back!\n",
      "Decided to to try something different, new. Picked this place out of the blue. I am super glad I did. Everything I tried was a little different but delicious. Definitely coming back. A must try.\n",
      "First time trying a Peruvian Meal! Loved it and the waitress was great , Thank you Adriana. Gonna bring my family here to try some delicious seafood dishes and I'm especially looking forward for dessert next time!\n",
      "We got hungry at the perfect time. Driving around and saw this place. It's absolutely amazing. Had the pork tamal peruano, ceviche mixto, and tacu tacu lomo al jugo. Everything was so delicious. Best ceviche we've ever had!! You gotta come in.\n",
      "Hole in the wall exterior. Parking lot is super small. Don't let that discourage though!! The food is worth it! Our First time here we found the quality of the food rivals Peruvian restaurants in Sonoma and New York. The recipes are spot on. Even the seafood was great. Will definitely be back again and again. No lunch menu so be prepared to share or go home with leftovers.\n",
      "Consistantly very good. My wife is peruvian and I am very familiar with peruvian food. The food is better than many restaurants in peru. I love the anticuchos, and causas. The lomo saltado is great, aji de gallina also. Escaveche de pollo was brilliant, but was a little too over spiced. Also loved the Lucuma ice cream. Solid 4.5 stars.\n",
      "Tiny spot with limited parking but worth it for some tasty food that is likely different than anything you have had before. The Papa a La Huancaina looks meh but the taste is fabulous! The fried rice dish was so tasty and plenty for me to have lunch the next day. It's a little expensive for an ethnic hole in the wall but the food is good enough that I'm sure Ill be back for more. They are super friendly too!\n",
      "Don't let the small store front fool you; this place makes up for it once you are inside. Delicious food, very authentic. Glad to have found this. This is the place to come to really have a taste of Peru. They have cultural tv as well. The workers are very nice people.\n",
      "Great food and biggest glass of wine EVER. Very nice people. And the lunch special is enough for two!\n",
      "In AZ and not sure what to eat? want something flavorful and definitely worth every penny? El Chullo is your spot! go here and you totally won't regret it one bit!!!! ordered: *Lomo Saltado-YUM! flavorful. one of their most popular items at el chullo. i definitely didn't want to stop eating this! everything was very well seasoned and the beef strips were cooked perfectly. the tomatoes were very flavorful as well! *arroz con pollo- this was recommended to me by the staff. which i thought was pretty good. the rice was flavorful and the sauce that came with it was very unique. for my first time having arroz con pollo i was definitely left with a good impression and would definitely try to order this at other peruvian places. overall, staff is really nice. the bittersweet part about coming here is you're hungry you gotta wait quite awhile for your food because they make it fresh. it's like i like the idea of it being made fresh but the wait is long for the food. also they don't have the spicy dipping sauce i've had at other Peruvian food places that you eat with bread. they however give you these unpopped popcorn kernel thing that is lightly salted. personally i didn't care for it. tips: *small front of store parking lot. *cash and credit cards accepted *they post a lot of their food on instagram *serves alcohol. *they have a few TVs. *indoor seating only. *not super ideal for large parties since it's a small little mom and pops place.\n",
      "My wife and I just stopped in based on the review when we walked in there was three tables open two square 4 seat and one two seat however the two seat is all alone right in the middle of the room yuck so I ask the lady if we could sit at one of the square 4 seats open and she said no only the bar or the terrible two seater sadly that's the first time I've ever walked out when I saw such a good review couples will have a hard time enjoying this kind of poor customer service in fact I probably would've bought enough food for four well their loss we found a very romantic place only a half mile from there\n",
      "This restaurant is a \"must\" for any lover of Latin A,Erica's cuisine. I had the Frijoles con Seco a la Nortena (stewed beef with rice and beans) all I can say is \"wow\"! The beef was super tender and the dish had a great range of flavors and seasonings, very well prepared. It was enough to share if you also get an appetizer, as are some of the other dishes. Service was quick and pleasant, definitely a return visit on the agenda, although I'll make sure to share so that we can try the deserts too!\n",
      "Great food staff was very nice for our large group. The kitchen could not handle the amount of people food came out at different times. It was my first time at a Peruvian Restaurant enjoyed it a lot.\n",
      "So impressed with this place, peruvian food is comfort food to me and every peruvian restaurant that I find in phoenix always ends up closing down but I sure hope this place sticks around the food is absolutely amazing and spot on with authenticity! The service is also great our server was very nice and did a great job! This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and I will be back!\n",
      "When my friend texted me to see if I want to go have Peruvian food at El Chullo, I was very excited. As adventurous as my palate is, I had never been to this local gem. LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me. Along with their Momma, the sons are the chefs creating some of their own along with recipes handed down by their ancestors. The flavors are incredible. I can't wait to take the family back. Another fabulous local go to place for me... Woohoo!!!!\n",
      "Service was ok not the best, food was pretty good the only thing I had a problem with is that we had to wait a long period of time to get our food, they dont have Aji verde sauce, no bread, butter and prices are ridiculous. We were charged $7 extra to replace the chicken with meet for the arroz chaufa. I have never spent $20 on just arroz chaufa. Lomo saltado was little salty and around $17 we are visiting from Los Angeles and maybe we are just spoiled but there's a big difference. FYI the explanation for the extra charge was that they use sirloin!!! Well in Los Angeles they use Fillet Mignon! Also if you get a chance to sit at the bar facing the kitchen you might be disappointed that most of there food is microwaved.\n"

      "All I can say is \"WOW\" the ceviche was super delish. I've tried a few peruvian places in the past and El Chullo wins in my book. I tried both the ceviche mixto & the ceviche with fish and they are both amazing dishes. I really liked the flavors. I also had lomo saltado and same thing the flavors were soooo good. This is my new favorite restaurant. Enjoy!\n",
      "My husband and I saw the reviews on this place we are from California visting here for the weekend so we decided to give it a try the food was delicious The service was ok our waitress disappeared for a while I was thirsty and my 2 year old wanted water I asked another waitress for a cup of water and she did but wasnt to kind like if it bothered her she was extra kind with everyone else plus my water had some green stuff in it\n",
      "Exquisite, finger licking good Peruvian food! The best Peruvian food I've ever had outside of Peru. Great cozy ambiance, friendly staff, and good service. The food brought up memories of my grandmother's restaurant in Ilo, Perú.\n",
      "When on a Friday, got in just in time, around 6:30 before it really got packed. It is a small place so easy to fill up with just a few parties. The ceviche was awesome! Pisco sour was tasty but a tad overpriced at $9. Suggest grabbed a few pints of craft brew at the Main Ingredient Ale House down the street beforehand if you are looking for some craft beer.\n",
      "The food here is actually better than a lot of the food that I had in Peru (not sure what this means). Our favorite is the arroz con pollo with cilantro rice, aji potatoes, and pickled onions. The chicken is so flavorful, moist. The rice has pieces of the giant corn in it. We've also tried the ceviche, escabeche de pollo, carapulcra. All great. Love how they serve cancha, the Peruvian corn nuts, as a pre-meal snack!\n",
      "The reason I rated it ok was due to the service. The food was excellent. It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back.\n",
      "Legit Peruvian in Phoenix! Ceviche came as white hot as can be found in Lima. Anticuchos de corazon were prepared correctly. My only complaints: very little parking and no Peruvian beer to wash down the food. Did I mention that actual Peruvians eat here? That has got to count for something.\n",
      "This week the Jolly Diner went to a Peruvian restaurant called El Chullo on 7th Street in Phoenix. I can't pronounce the names of each of the entrees, but I have to say that they were very well prepared and presented. All of the food we had was just excellent. They weren't too spicy and artfully presented. They also serve Peruvian drinks. The waitress was very kind and able to explain each of the dishes, and each was delicious. Joining us this week were my daughter and her husband who is Chilean/Peruvian - so we had a subject matter expert. The Jolly Diners rated El Chullo a 3.5 out of 5. The decor is nice, parking is a bit challenging, but worth it because the food tastes great and is reasonably priced.If you like to try something different and authentically Peruvian, you'll have to try El Chullo.\n",
      "What a great change of scenery (diamond in the rough) El Chullo restaurant. Visited today for the first time and experienced great service, great food and overall value for my price. Will most definitely be back. A must try in the Phoenix area for any locals or visitors. Muchas gracias to my new favorite restaurant.\n",
      "I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy. The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!\n",
      "Best restaurant in Phoenix! The Food was amazing. it is run by a Peruvian family. Our server so genuinely enjoyed his work. The food was delicious and artistically plated.\n",
      "Location is cute although the Parking situation isn't the best. Service was exceptional by a young girl. Our first time trying Peruvian food and or server explained some items which we ordered. They also offer great Peruvian beverages like the inca soda. The food was simply delicious in every bite. I seriously can't describe it any further at the moment since I am so stuffed by the food! Certainly worth a try.\n",
      "Arroz con pollo was good as well as the purple corn drink. Sorry dont remember the name of it service was great. It wasnt too busy so may be the reason why others have given bad reviews. But overall pleasant experience with good food\n",
      "Love the food! Love the staff. So authentic and I'm so happy it's in the heart of Phoenix!! The ceviche (both of them) is legit and the pollo saltado is so fulfilling. Let that ish fill yo' mouth with deliciousness!!\n",
      "Best ceviche I have tasted outside of Peru (as good as that of La Divina Comida in San Jose, Costa Rica)! Great family run restaurant. If you want authentic Peruvian food then this is the place for you. Thanks for the great food and service.\n",
      "I have eaten here twice now. I get cravings for their delicious cause rellena, which is a stack of creamy potato purée, chicken salad, avocado, and egg with creamy mustardy sauce. Their lomo Saltado is sure to please with perfect strips of beef in a delicious mildly spicy sauce, with a triangle mound of white rice and French fried potatoes. I highly recommend this locally owned restaurant!\n",
      "The best ceviche mixto! The lomo saltado is always on point as well as the tallarin saltado. My favorite Peruvian spot in Phoenix.\n",
      "We were in Phoenix and couldn't figure out where to go for food. I typed in my favorite Latin dish, arroz con pollo and came across this place! Glad I found it! My fiancé and I were pleasantly surprised with how good this small place is. Every table was full on a Saturday night. We weren't used to seeing this in Phoenix. The arroz con pollo was so good! We also ordered ceviche which was bomb. The texture of the fish was perfect. I also tried a pisco sour which was excellent.\n",
      "Hello, I have been going to this restaurant for probably five years now. I have come to rate Peruvian cuisine, the best in the world, in my opinion. As far as that last review by a lady named Leslie, I think she was way too hard on them. Some of the very very very best restaurants are just small little places, and family owned.! Sometimes you have to have patience when places like that are busy. They always always are welcoming, so she must of had an attitude problem. And that's probably hitting the nail on the head! I love this place and so do many of my friends. Don't let it get you down, El. chullo! We still luv you! It's the best Peruvian food in the whole valley! And I've been to the other ones. I could tell you way way way worse stories.\n",
      "Finally, a Peruvian restaurant we can actually go to in Phoenix! The food was absolutely delicious. The ceviche is outstanding and we'll be ordering that every time. Everything we ordered was delicious and even my 1 year old enjoyed the food and she's a picky eater. Our waitress was Maria and she was great and gave great recommendations. We're definitely coming back.\n",
      "Can't believe they've only been open a couple days! The meal was fantastic from start to finish. Tried the anticuchos, carapulcra, and alfajores for dessert. Everything tasted fresh, well seasoned, and home made. Great portions too! Will be back for more soon!\n",
      "Tasty Peruvian cuisine and very attentive staff. We had great soup, fried fish, and the lomo saltado was scrumptious. I will definitely be going again to explore more Peruvian dishes.\n",
      "Visited for the first time yesterday on the recommendation of a famous local restauranteur and everything he said about the family and the food was absolutely true. Wonderful culinary experience and added to our list of favorite locally owned and operated restaurants.\n",
      "I loved this place! What a nice surprise. I feel like I should always try these tiny places with \"foreign\" food but I never really do because I'm afraid most would be misses rather than hits. This was a hit and has inspired to try more places like this! Our friends had heard good things about this place so we gave it a shot and I will keep going back! We ordered a few apps to share: Anticucho, Papa Rellena, and Yuca Frita. We loved them all! The Anticucho and Yuca Fritas were so good I will definitely order them every time I go! Then each of us order an entree. I got the Arroz con Mariscos, Jess got the Arroz con Pollo, my fiance the Ceviche and Josh the Lomo Saltado. To be honest I was pretty disappointed with my dish because it was more like a plate of rice with 4 pieces of seafood. However, Jess' Pollo tasted amazing, it had great seasoning. Mike's cveiche and Josh's Lomo were great too. We all left stuffed and happy! We will definitely be going back. Love the vibe of a family restaurant. We also recommend the Pisco Sours! It is a tiny place so if it's full you may have to wait. It'll be worth it!\n",
      "First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front. My friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot. Not to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams. I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better. And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy. So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix. I can only imagine how spicy hot is. Been here three times and I still crave it. Ok, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been. The causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. Good lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny. The kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!! It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt. Warning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love. Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalapeños. This is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch.\n",
      "Excellent food!!! I had the amazing opportunity to eat at this family owned and ran business. The food was outstanding and so was the service. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family.\n",
      "Well I was just visiting Phoenix and needed a lunch spot fast. Stumbled across this place and could not have been happier with the food and service. This is not fine dining, it is a neighborhood place with as close to homemade latin food as you can get. I started with some yucca frittas which were great and came with two very tasty salsas. I had a chicken dish (forgot the name) with a red sauce that was slightly greasy but packed with flavor and delicious. My friend had the arroz con pollo which was also excellent. Crap even the iced tea was apparently homemade. The server was attentive and made us feel at home. The place doesn't look like much but it is a great place for well prepared Peruvian food at good prices. I will definitely go here again when I'm in town.\n",
      "Need fancy intimate decor and ambiance? Not here... instead you'll get polite service and pretty darn good food. Don't let the interior (or exterior) discourage you. Having absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine I had not idea what the carapulcra would be. It was definitely a different take on 'stew', but it was delicious and they even stack your rice into the shapes of temples. 4/5 service 2/5 decor 5/5 food 5/5 location (pictures coming)\n",
      "I've driven by this hidden Peruvian Cafe many times and never noticed it until tonight. Truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but a nice cozy restaurant in the inside. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entreé. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entreé. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot.\n",
      "so you can't go wrong with this little hidden gem, if you are into south American or exotic food. they have a great variety of meats such as chicken beef and seafood. only problem is that there's limited parking in front, so you can park behind the restaurant in that little alley way if there's spaces available if not you are more than welcome to use the parking lot across the street. but any rate this place is diffidently worth checking out.\n",
      "First of all - very cool 'hole in the wall' kind of vibe. We walked in and were seated at one of the two remaining tables...good sign We started by splitting a 'choose three' appetizer platter. We got the Papa Rellena, Yuca Frita, and I don't remember the name of the third. The Papa Rellena was really good - tasted kind of like a tamale, but better - and served with some pickled onions, I think? Really tasty - this was the best. The Yuca Frita was good. The other one was about a 4\" diameter cylindrical shaped item about 1 1/2\" tall. It had chicken in it - I thought it tasted like deviled eggs - it was also very good, but we had to save room for the main course. My wife ordered the Ceviche - it was very good - had a lot of zing to it. Everybody else ordered the Lomo Saltado. It was also really good. Our server was friendly and attentive as well. Very nice place to go and get your Peruvian gnosh on.\n",
      "Great food! Authentic! Made to order and nice staff. Great atmosphere and music!! One too many flies for me, but still great me\n",
      "Excellent service,jalea, tacutacu con lomo, chicha, and maracuya Aji de gallina was good (maybe too much yellow paste) Highly recommend. Im peruvian :)\n",
      "Hidden gem. It has some minor work to do but it earned the five starts. Service was excellent, half the food from our big group came out fast, the other half not so fast, but it was still worth the wait. Appetizers were fast and held us through. Very authentic Peruvian food. I had the Chaufa, its Chinese/Peruvian food and excellent! I can't say enough about the Pisco Sour. The best I've ever had including in Peru!!! Well return for more. Cheat day restaurant for my family.\n",
      "I am a big supporter of family owned business so I decided to stop by and see what all the fuss is about. I have never had peruvian food before so I can't really compare my experience to another peruvian restaurant. The lot is small and it's kind of hard to park. The service is good. The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations. I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong. It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills. It's a business. I get it. I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back. If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once.\n",
      "The wife and I had been wanting some Peruvian food, so we decided to go to El Chullo based on all of the other Yelp reviews. Once again, Yelp does not lie! Everything that we ordered was delicious! The food was so flavorful and we enjoyed every bite that we ate. We will definitely be back as there are so many other tasty options that we would like to try!\n",
      "Very hard to find a good Peruvian restaurant that stays in business over a year. This one is by far the best one I have been to and I think it will be around for a long time. The food was delicious and very very close the the real deal in Peru. The ceviche was perfect, the lomo saltado was perfect and even the drinks were authentic Peruvian. I just wish it was closer to my house but it's better than nothing!\n",
      "If you're searching for some good authentic Peruvian food do yourself a favor and come eat here. You can thank me later!!! Came here to have lunch with family. I had been craving lomo saltado, if you never had this dish order it! Their lomo saltado is very tasty and definitely will come for more. I also had pisco which is Peruvian brandy and trust me that stuff will sneak up on you, I had the mango pisco sour please try it! And you guys know I am a sucker for dessert I ordered Alfajores, basically a cookie sandwich but don't be fooled this cookie sandwich comes straight from the cookie gods lol. I also ordered Lucuma ice cream which is a tropical fruit that honestly tastes better than pumpkin spice anything. Customer service is amazing! Very friendly and funny staff highly recommend this\n",
      "Worst service ever!! Now I know what it feels like to be discriminated against! If you're Peruvian, you good to go. Otherwise, do not enter! We were sat at a tiny little table in the middle of the restaurant that was smokey. We waited 10 minutes and never even offered glass of water!\n",
      "Its a good sign when you feel explosively full after a meal and yet still wear a silly grin on your face. Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon. I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there. Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed. As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building. This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store. There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived). There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance). The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area. When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background. When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter. A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only. It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend. I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour. Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites. Wow, talk about refreshing. There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion. For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling). Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce. Holy moly was this awesome. It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling. I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?). And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure. If you're coming here for the first time, get this. I'm making it mandatory. After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me. For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here. I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds). The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn). Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus. I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious. All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning. There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished. Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor. Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side. I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen. The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork. An awesome, decadent conclusion. Absolutely incredible meal. The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing. They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit. Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50. Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to). I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero.\n",
      "We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.). And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's. A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end. Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the \"lot\" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot. After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this). Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow. Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo. In fact, \"small\" pretty much describes it all: the parking. the restaurant, the portions. I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are \"very large\". Really? VERY large? Perhaps for someone who survived internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps). Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to (translation: non-Americans). We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to \"snack\". (Hey, I workout, get off my case!). We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina. Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS. Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since \"papa\" means 'potato'). I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo. Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end. Again, like I said: not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries. Nuff said. The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can? For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip. Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity. Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food. The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line. Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating. That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining). While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars. Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it. For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine. If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards. No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full.\n",
      "Incredible tallarín con mariscos (spaghetti with seafood). I had not seen this preparation before and as a Peruvian and a foodie I have an abundant amount of experience in Peruvian cuisine! The flavor was incredible, bursting with flavor! A bit of Rocoto to add a nice touch of spiciness. I had to order a side a rice so I could absorb all of the fabulous juice. My wife had a sampler platter with Papa a la Huancaina, papa rellena and causa! She raved about each of them. She also had an Afajor for dessert and it was wonderful! The owners are a family, each contributing to the success of the restaurant! Pricing is competitive. We went this evening and had to wait about 15 minutes as we apparently are not the only ones who know about this wonderful little restaurant! The restaurant is small but as they continue to build a clientele, this place is certain to grow and be even more successful!\n",
      "Food is just ok nothing really special so I am so surprised by all the great reviews. Restaurant is small and they don't have proper ventilation so you leave smelling like fried food. Won't be coming back.\n",
      "I went to El Chullo on a Friday night with two other people. We were seated immediately but it was very busy ( a great sign)! The food was great-I had arroz chaufa con pollo, which is a sort of chinese rice with chicken, and my sister and friend both had the lomo saltado. The dining room is very small; just something to keep in my mind. Very friendly service,great food, and a great latin vibe.\n",
      "When a friend asked about the table about other Peruvian restaurants in Phoenix, my Peruvian friend said, \"none are worth going to.\" Needless to say, this place is great! I've been several times, and the food is always delicious. My favorite is the Tacu Tacu with lomo. I get it every time, but I know I should try other things too! The ceviche and lomo soltado are also very good. The ceviche is fresh, and the lomo just doesn't disappoint - full of flavor! This time around, I fortunately had a friend who was wanting to split two dishes! I forget the one she got (it's in the pictures), but it was a beef stew. The beef was very tender, but we both agreed the Tacu Tacu was better of the two. The Tacu Tacu has a great consistency and texture. It's crispy on the outside and firm, not mushy, on the inside. The lomo that comes with it is in a sauce with onions and tomatoes - very flavorful! The ooooooonly thing that I'll say bad about this place that it may be a tad too salty sometimes. Overall, I'm a big fan....and I need more people who are willing to split dishes with me!! :)\n",
      "I'm very glad my wife and I finally got around to trying El Chullo, a little hole in the wall off 7th street. I got the escabeche de pollo. The chicken is described as pan fried but it didn't taste fried, and I mean that in a good way, and the sauce was very tasty. My wife loved the tallarines verdes-- pesto spaghettis (yes, spaghetti with an s) and steak. And for dessert: a giant alfajor, cookies with dulce de leche filling. Overall, a great first Peruvian food experience\n",
      "Best ceviche I've had in America!!!! So good! I've been to Peru so there was one delicacy that is very Peruvian but I didn't see on the menu (cuy), I wish it was, but I understand if it's more of a regional thing. Service was super friendly, great place for sure!!!\n",
      "The food is good the service is not. It took 30 minutes for the soup to arrive and another 20 minutes for the dinner to be on the table. Plus the chicken breast I ordered was so thick in suspicious way pushing me to think where do they buy their ingredients from!\n",
      "El Chullo is an authentic eatery staffed and operated by natives, and frequented by those seeking to indulge in true homemade Peruvian deliscousness. My wife and I took our three kids and a cousin visiting from Venezuela. The adults had a carafe of white sangria and the kids had a Peruvian staple, chicha. We had the appetizer platter, and chose fried yuca, causa rellena, and a Peruvian tamal. We ate every last ounce of food and sauce! For our entrees, the kids had the tallarin and salchipapas, and the adults had ceviche and the mixed seafood platter. The ceviche was some of the best Peruvian ceviche we've had. The seafood platter was made up of deep fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and oysters. It was served with boiled potatoes and fried yuca. Everything was great, and the service was awesome. The seafood platter was a little over cooked, but then again it's deep fried so what can you expect. We will definitely come back and bring our Peruvian neighbors to enjoy tasty authentic food they don't have to prepare themselves. :-)\n",
      "Yum! The food is authentic and one of the best Peruvian restaurants that I've eaten in. The service was great. I was the only one in my party that had eaten Peruvian food before and everyone else had a lot of questions. The waitress was so nice and patient. She obviously took a lot of pride in the food they serve, particularly their more traditional food and drinks. This place is a must try.\n",
      "Peruvian cuisine seems to be based on chicken and potatoes- fine with me. El Chullo is a New Times Award winning place on 7th Street north of Virginia. Can't remember the names of what I ordered but the appetizer was a thin sliced marinated fried potato. You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entrée was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert. El Chullo has an air of authenticity about it and I most likely will go back in the future.\n",
      "Delicious! My husband, who is Peruvian, felt this was authentic. Only downside would've been that they were understaffed. It's not a big place, but once it filled up, the one waitress was running. Also, parking is limited, which is typical for DT Phoenix. Highly recommend trying at least once. Our favorites were: Lomo saltado (beef with French fries and gravy-like sauce), papa rellena (stuffed potato), tallarin saltado con carne (tenderloin with spaghetti) and of course pisco sours!\n",
      "We had to drop my sister off at the airport and wanted to try something new so I launched my Yelp to see what I had bookmarked nearby and saw this. Neither my mom nor I had ever tried Peruvian food so we thought we would give this place a try. It's right on 7th street so parking in front of the small restaurant (7 tables and a few chairs at a small bar) is very limited, so if you miss it, just turn right on the first street and then take a right into the alley and park in the small lot behind the restaurant. You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front. We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36. We loved everything. I can't remember the names for each, but I'll post pics!\n",
      "Decided to treat my wife and one of her lady friends to something different. I've had this place bookmarked for ages and never seem to be in this area around eating time. This is a really cool family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Peruvian style artwork as well as several articles and \"Best of\" awards displayed proudly on the walls. We came for the lunch service which starts at noon. The menu is loaded with a good variety of Peruvian favorites. It was tough to choose what we wanted and took advantage of the photos on Yelp to decide. The server was also most helpful and gave us a good idea on how it would taste. We started with an appetizer plate that had a mixture of three different items. See my photo. The Papa Rellena was our favorite in the grouping. It is described as a golden-fried creamy potato dough stuffed with meat, eggs, raisins and olives and served with red onions marinated in lime juice. So good! The ladies ordered a dish with Rice & Peruvian beans topped with a cilantro Beef stew called Frijoles con seco a la norteña. Yours truly ordered one called Escabeche de Pollo with a side of their spicy homemade Hot Sauce. It is pan fried Chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar. Both the food and service were spectacular. The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly and helpful. We even had the chance to talk to the chef and get a couple of top secret tips that she uses in her recipes. This is not a very big place and the parking area is really small out front. They say there is also additional parking behind the restaurant with a back entrance when very busy. Can't wait to eat here again and maybe even try recreating a couple recipes at home. This stuff is plate licking crazy good. Just try and restrain yourself and use a spoon. Simplemente Delicioso! 4.75 STARS\n",
      "I'm not an expert on Peruvian food, but I thought the food here was really good. Service left a lot to be desired, as there are only about 6 or 7 tables in the place and somehow it still took our server over 5 minutes to bring us water and about 30 minutes to put our order in. What could have been a 35-45 minute meal turned into over 1 hour... not sure if I'll be back.\n",
      "The seafood soup is delicious! I ordered the beef with the pasta and it was so good! Will go back\n",
      "don't let the location keep you from entering this little gem. excellent food. papa rellena is a must try.\n",
      "I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side. To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner. All in all it was a great time and a great meal! I can't wait to go back.. perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and or dinner tonight because honestly I just can't get enough.\n",
      "Food was decent. Good cerviche. Fried fish was a bit heavy. Place didn't run their a/c. Checked their thermostat next to the bathroom and it was 91 degrees in the place. Towards the end of the meal it was difficult to even be in there anymore. It's 105 outside today, there is no excuse for not running the a/c. Won't be coming back.\n",
      "Divine Peruvian food. I had the PAPA RELLENA & the chicken escabeche which both were amazing. I also drank the pisco drink w ginger ale which I like better than pisco sours. I'm going back here ALOT, I'm Peruvian and this is authentic food w fantastic flavor. Can't wait to try their ceviche and seco next time I go.....\n",
      "Most excellent, our waiter recommended an appetizer, drinks and the main courses. I've never had Peruvian food before, I am now a fan, hook, line and sinker!\n",
      "I am so in love with this little place! I have lived in the Coronado neighborhood about 5 years and have seen many things go in and out of this location...i have a feeling El Chullo will be sticking around. Everything i've had so far has been AMAZING. The Chupe De Camarones soup and Tacu Tacu De Marisco were seriously out of this world. The service is also excellent. They are so genuinely friendly and make you feel right at home. Can't say enough good stuff about this little gem...and i am beyond picky with restaurants, especially in Phoenix. It is the best restaurant on 7th st. by far in my opinion.\n",
      "This was my first time here with my wife. Her words exactly \"What an experience!\" We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered the ceviche with medium heat and the Escobeche con pollo, dark meat. Amazing! So many people have been talking about this place lately. I'm so glad we tried it. We will return!\n",
      "Excellent food with poor service. While bringing our pisco to the table, one of the waiters questioned the validity of my friend's Arizona driver's license (she is 26 years old). She said condescendingly \"Hmm I don't know if this is real because I don't want minors drinking here, but I'll give the drink to you this time\". She then proceeded to comment on how young I appear as well, even though I didn't order a drink (surprise, I'm also 26!). On top of that, the bottom of my friend's drink literally fell out of the glass while she was drinking. Her food, shirt, and belongings were covered in pisco sour. Instead of uttering a single word of apology, the same waiter commented on how \"this happens all the time\". Incredulous, I asked her if the bottoms of glasses commonly fall out in this restaurant. She responded \"oh no, I just assumed that she dropped it, the glass falling out has never happened before\". Needless to say, the food is good, but the waiter's patronizing behavior was unwelcome and reflects poorly on the potential of this restaurant. Will not be returning because of that reason. Tips to other young-appearing people who want to try this restaurant: Bring your passport if you want drinks!!\n",
      "I have never Peruvian food in the United States that tasted as if you were in Lima, Peru. The gastronomy of this country is amazing, I always enjoy the food whenever I have visited the country. This restaurant was amazing. My sister and I went out to eat and I found it on Yelp. My food was excellent! Everything was delicious!\n",
      "I used to rate this excellent food a 5, but now only a 3.5 only because the price increases. The dishes we order each went up $2-$3 each so now rather than be an excellent pricy lunch it is very expensive (e.g. Tacu tacu dish with steak is now $19.95) - wow that's too much!. Unfortunately, I won't be back soon but that's only due to the recent price increases.\n",
      "YUM! I walked 50min to try this place and it was worth every step! Next time I'm in Phoenix I will return\n",
      "We went during their breakfast menu hours (10-12). Their menu consisted of sharable dishes for 2. They were able to flex and cater to my girlfriend's dietary restrictions, and the food still came out very delicious and perfectly seasoned. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast date.\n",
      "Everything we ate was fantastic which is amazing because we've been searching for a good central/South American/Spanish restaurant. Arroz verse con pollo was perfection. Potatas con queso was amazing as well. Plantains were perfectly ripe and had a delicious crisp. Ceviche was also delicious. We also took the famous dessert to go which we have not yet tried but looks fantastic. This is definitely our new spot\n",
      "I was in PHX for the day and really wanted some Peruvian food since there aren't many options in Tucson for it. This place had great reviews and a friend of mine also suggested it so I had to try it out. We called ahead of time to get a reservation and they said they could \"likely squeeze us in\" which was strange since there were not many people there when we arrived. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from the service in general. Our table got the fish ceviche, chicken tacu tacu and the seafood tacu tacu to share. The food was really great but it was all really salty! I generally like my food to be salty but it was even too much for me. In the future I would make sure to ask for less salt on the meals. Otherwise it was really flavorful.\n",
      "Went on a whim. The drinks were tasty. Enjoyed my dish as well as my companions. I would like some more spice to it. I have been to Peru and the food is divine. Well priced and clean as well as a friendly staff.\n",
      "The next best thing to actually being in Peru. The beverages were great - the Pisco Sour and Chicha Morada deserve 5 stars by themselves. The entrees were also a hit. I ordered the Aji de Gallina, and my boyfriend ordered the Ceviche. He was so blown away by the Ceviche that he wants to go back for it every weekend. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the appetizer. We ordered Yuca Frita, and it was a little over-fried for my taste. Overall, it was a great dining experience. I am from Peru and felt like I was eating from my family's kitchen. I will mention that it ended up being a bit pricey, BUT it was worth it.\n",
      "Peruvian cuisine is Interesting, flavorful and varied. El Chullo is a very small restaurant so recommend making reservations. Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood. Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early.\n",
      "Coming from Miami it is so difficult to find good authentic Hispanic food out here. Specially Peruvian! But oh man so thankful for this place! Love their food, as close as you can get to authentic Peruvian here in Phoenix. It's a tiny hole in the wall but so worth it! Aren't those always the best places tho? This is a for sure must! Lomo saltado and jalea mixta are great! Also the antichchos!\n",
      "We found this place on Yelp and it's definitely worth the try. The staff is extremely nice, the food is amazing and their especial desert is phenomenal. I've had Peruvian food in the past and got my wife to try it for the first time. She loved it! We r definitely coming back! This place is a diamond on a hay stack!!\n",
      "Positive: Great service, friendly, genuine people. Family-owned and it shows. Appetizers are awesome. Best I've had in a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona. The anticuchos are just right and ideally spiced, the ocopa was perfect, the papa rellena was delicious. The spices and general flavor is authentic, rich and tasty. There is a good variety of dishes, some of which you can't find elsewhere in Arizona. Presentation is good, sides are well chosen. Portions are bigger than average for the entrees. Lucuma ice cream tasted just like in Peru. Not so good: -Dishes are somewhat overpriced. -The arroz con mariscos could use more seafood, more limon and more aji. It was too greasy and not spicy enough. -Although the food was clean, and so were the napkins and silverware, there were a few bugs crawling on the floor. It's understandable. The weather is heating up. I just never saw that many in a restaurant. Some pest control would be a good idea. Overall, I recommend this place for authentic Peruvian food and family ambience. It's cozy and fun. You just have to be choosy about what to order so it's worth the money and tastes good!\n",
      "Great peruvian and very authentic. Love this place. Their ceviche did not skimp on the fish and was very good (very different from Mexican ceviche.....just in case you were wondering).\n",
      "(Lyrics - Restless Heart - When She Cries) The place I have traveled in Is Yelped with good reviews It's littered with several stars That only quite came true When all of my peers were drinking Her food kept me trying She does her best to cook The meal that Bo Bites been through El Chullo's tonight And I really think that I should taste it It can't hide All the meals they make inside El Chullo serves up some authentic Peruvian style food! I just got back from Peru and unfortunately they don't serve Cuy! Now that would be authentic! In any case, my foodie friends and I ordered individually but different dishes. I went with the Tallarin Saltado, a spaghetti like dish with beef. Overall, it was pretty solid. Salty and just a tad bit of spice, with the crunch of the raw onions giving this dish a savory bite! However, my 2 favorites of the night were the beef heart and the fried rice! Beef heart anyone!? Yeah, it came a super spicy sauce you can add and when I say be careful.....BE CAREFUL! Youch! Spicy indeed, but the heart was so tender....uh yummy! The fried rice...I thought my mama made good fried rice; sorry mom! Overall, one of the best bite of fried rice I had in a while. It was a blend of Peruvian and Chinese style so I totally appreciate the fusion and so will you! The service was spot on with our large group plus no mix up with our checks, which is totally awesome. The place is very tiny so be sure to make your reservations! - Enjoy!\n",
      "Great food and service... Had Lunch on Valentines Day .... MUST HAVE --- Pisco Sour drink which is made with -fresh lime juice, cinnamon & cloves syrup, beaten egg whites, angostura bitter. ARROZ CON MARISCOS Sautéed rice & seafood mix. Only issue is parking very limited space .....\n",
      "My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water. It's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.\n",
      "My friend and I came there last night and the small restaurant was packed. Who I believe was one of the owners/main chef greeted us and explained it might be a while before we could order because they were so busy. She was so warm and kind and so was everyone else. My friend and I had a pisco maracuya (passion fruit pisco) and they were delicious. We also split a causa rellena, a cold mashed potato cake with a chicken filling, and the lomo saltado, a dish with beef tenderloin and french fries and rice. Everything was really delicious and seasoned so well but next time I will probably opt for less starch in one meal. I rated this five stars because I really couldn't get over how wonderful the overall experience was to talk with the Peruvian chef and feel somewhat like I was with family :). Also, this woman recommended the ceviche because it's prepared unique to Peruvian culture and I will say it looked amazing at someone else's table.\n",
      "The alfajores rock! My one single favorite thing from this place. Peruvian food is not my favorite, cannot comment on the food.\n",
      "Pros: Food, service, price. Cons: Smaller sized restaurant (may be occasional waits), parking (park across the street - see parking section below). The food here is amazing. I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak. The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch. The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent. Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine. Really delicious and highly recommend. Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint).\n",
      "Excellent place to eat foreign food. Very clean restaurant with amicable servers who take the time to explain their national dishes. Superb!\n",
      "This is a very small Peruvian Restaurant with a bar. They serve mostly Peruvian Food thats heavy with rice and lots of potatoes. They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture. I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home. My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion. The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet. Service was very friendly and welcoming.\n",
      "Unique flavors. The green pesto on fettacinni was awesome. The green rice with Pollo outstanding. Traditional state drink sharp alive and delicious. Will be returning to try other menu items.\n",
      "Drove 45 ... Well worth it .. The Ceviche Mixto is to die for. Everything was great, from the presentation, portion, texture, flavor and spices .. Just Perfect ! Super Friendly staff, easy to talk to and very knowledgeable about their dishes, def coming back next time I'm in AZ !\n",
      "This is an excellent representation of Peruvian food. Having lived there for 3 years on and off, I can say that most the dishes were authentic. My table had the Chupe de Camarones, which was a meal unto itself, 2 people had the the Aji de Gallina- which was very tasty and quite spicy and one had the Tallarines Verdes con Lomo. We had traditional Pisco sours which were quite tasty as well. The restaurant is very small but clean and the wait staff is vey pleasant. The service is slow due to all plates being made to order but that is certainly one of the reasons the food is delicious. I would definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of Peruvian food or curious to learn about it. The prices are resonable as well. Our tab for 4 came to $153 and that was with 8 Pisco sours. Like another reviewer said-\"Viva Peru carajo!\"\n",
      "So good! Felt like I was back in Peru for a moment! Their Rocoto salsa was AMAZING!! The food was fantastic. Family owned and operated, and they were all super nice. Step out of your comfort zone and grab some authentic Peruvian flavors at this place!\n",
      "This place was great. My family and I enjoyed the delicious Peruvian food they offered. The only complaint I have is that the place is too Small and the deserts are a bit pricey.\n",
      "This little gem is a 3 minute walk from us and it's delicious! A must try for some authentic Peruvian fare. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Incredible flavors and great service. As an individual who spent a lot of years in Peru I can appreciate what has been the best Peruvian food I've had in Phoenix - at El Chullo! Highly recommend the anticuchos, lomo saltado, and an alfajor for dessert. I look forward to my next dining experience here! (Probably tomorrow!)\n",
      "What! I don't know how I've been missing this place. The traditional Pisco sour was amazing, like an alcoholic, less sweet, key lime pie. I had chicharrones, a stuffed potato pastry that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Both were served with lime juice and cilantro marinated red onions that gave the dishes such perfect balance. A pork stew for my entree and I was stuffed to the gills and exceedingly pleased. The staff is crazy friendly. Will go back four to five million more times.\n",
      "Food was okay...little too salty and it takes a long time to get order. For the cost I was expecting more.\n",
      "My husband got me hooked on this place. Their sushi is so expensive but it is so delicious and it's addictive. You get what you pay for and it's worth paying more for it. Once you eat here no other sushi will do. Just saying.\n",
      "Too cramped . ..I dont like eating & people climbing all over each other. The food was ok. Had a couple rolls...was just put off by being so cramped... Couldn't really enjoy my food and just wanted to leave.\n",
      "Awesome suhsi zone.I am a Sushi novice who has picked up the temptation in the last year or so,but from whatever places I have tried in the phoenix area,this place wins handsdown. The place isnt huge and owing to the popularity it will be filled up most of the time.The servers are friendly and the sushi tastes fresh.I loved some of their spicy rolls- I think one of them was Volcano Roll. Will be back for more.\n",
      "This place is great!My fiancé and I stopped in for dinner and couldn't have been more pleased. We ordered the Tofu, Vegas roll, and Chicken Katsu. All of the dishes we ordered were great. I was really pleased with the Tofu considering I'm not a big fan. On top of the great food the service was excellent. I will definitely be recommending this place to family and friends.\n",
      "5 stars for this one! Great food and awesome service. I had the udon noodle with shrimp tempura bowl. Sooooo good. Girlfriend got a tuna roll and loved it.\n",
      "I've been coming here since they opened around five years ago, and I have been a regular customer since. I'm what you could call a devotee. So consider that when you read this gushing review. This is a family-run, neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall storefront next to a hair salon and a small boxing gym. It's not a fancy place. But don't let that fool you. The people in the kitchen and the sushi bar have impressive restaurant credentials going back many years and across the pacific. They are fanatical about food quality, to the point where I've seen them toss what any other restaurant would call a perfectly good fish shipment if it was not up to their standards. They are friendly and gracious, and your enjoyment of the food is foremost. It's a place where you can sit at the sushi bar and ask the chefs to decide what you're eating, trust Koji and Lori, and be impressed with just about everything. The sushi and sashimi are extremely fresh and very tasty, and they always have some sort of unusual or seasonal fish special you can't find anywhere else. They don't have a ton of variety on the menu--maybe 12 or 15 rolls, the usual assortment of nigiri, and then sashimi and hand rolls--but what they do have is made with top-quality ingredients and delicious. Sushi bar specials are on the board behind the chefs and they're happy to take time to explain what they are. And even though I go there primarily for sushi the kitchen items have never disappointed. Noodle dishes and soups are hearty and very reasonably priced, and for lunch they have a large selection of bentos that include rolls and sashimi so you can have the best of both worlds. They even have a wonderful steak and lobster combination that would give any fancy steakhouse in town a run for its money. If there are any complaints I could possibly have, it's that the table service can be a little spotty at times. It just seems unorganized because there's enough staff to handle it, but everyone seems to be doing every job rather than having a host, a server, a runner, etc. Nevertheless, I can't recommend this place enough for a casual yet delicious meal.\n",
      "Food was excellent and fresh. Beautiful presentation of each dish. Very busy as expected of a place that serves food that is well worth the wait. I grew up in Hawaii eating sushi and raw fish. This is by far some of the best I have experienced in Arizona. If your yearning for some quality sushi, this is it.\n",
      "Came in here with high expectations being that it's on Phoenix food nerds approved list of top restaurants in Phoenix. I was disappointed with my experience. We ordered the Hana bento box combo which includes salad, miso soup, six chef's choice sashimi, California roll, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and some kind of pickled veggies. The good was the fish, very fresh. The bad was almost everything else, nothing special about it, we could get the rest of this at almost any Japanese restaurant. The prices were high for what you get and there wasn't enough food for the high prices. Anyways disappointed and despite the high reviews on yelp and being on phxfoodnerds approved list for 2013, first place I've tried on this list the doesn't make the cut, this place is just like any Japanese eatery with higher prices and the food tastes average.\n",
      "Bummer......I had high hopes, but I was disappointed. Prior Yelp reviews have been quite good for 'Hana'. After I munched some sushi here last night, I re-read their reviews and found that my sushi experience here was consistent with the most recent reviews......average at best. I've been visiting Phoenix from my home in the SF Bay Area for several weeks now and my sushi jones was growing unmanageable.......I had to have SUSHI! Per Yelp reviews, I chose Hana as the provider of said sushi. I ordered nigiri style sushi,(raw fish on a small rice base)......one order each of hamachi(yellow tail), sake(salmon) and (unagi)fresh water eel. As opposed to most other types of sushi, unagi is not served raw; it's grilled on a hibachi after being coated with a teriyaki type sauce. The sake and hamachi were no better than average and the unagi was sub-standard. The sake was lacking in flavor, the hamachi likewise; the unagi had plenty of flavor, but the flavor was from the sauce on it....not from the unagi. Rightly or wrongly.....I WANNA TASTE THE FISH!...... I also had one order of 'sake maki'; 'maki' style is fish with rice and nori(seaweed) rolled on outside of the fish. The roll is then cut into six small pieces for presentation......I like nori, and 'maki' rolls are more filling than nigiri style sushi; however, the salmon in my 'sake maki' was also lacking in flavor. I attribute the flavorlessness in my sushi to the quality of the fish being used by Hana; in all the sushi I ate at Hana, the fish was 'lean'. As with good steak, sushi's flavor and tender texture are dependent on how much 'fat' is in the flesh. Hana uses fish that's low in fat content. Sushi grade fish is available from suppliers in different grade levels...... the higher the fat content in the fish, the higher the grade level(flavor content) of the fish. Higher fat content fish costs more from the vendor. Hana prices their sushi at high grade prices, but serves sushi made from standard grade fish, thus.....less flavor in the sushi. Added edit: Hana does offer sushi from 'wild' sake(salmon) at the higher price of $10; that price is more than a little expensive and as I didn't try it, I don't know if it has more fat/flavor than the 'regular' sake they serve. 'Nuff said. By the way, fish fat, as opposed to red meat fat, is good for you due to the omega 3 content in fish fat.\n",
      "What a great place to eat!! The freshest sushi and great staff. Had the best Yellowtail\n",
      "Hana's has been getting alot of great press lately and based on my visit much deserved. They were just named one of the 20 best places for Sushi, by Travel & Leisure Magazine in the world, planet, or somewhere that I cannot remember exactly. I was very happy on a recent visit as the fish was fresh and the staff was spot on. Much to my surprise I loved the BYOB with no corkage charges. I figure I saved half as much, buying my beverages at the grocery store, over paying restaurant beverage prices.\n",
      "Best restaurant in Phoenix. Best Chef in Phoenix. Best Small Business in Arizona. Best Sushi in The American Southwest. I love this place. Everyone who works here is the best too. This is where we go for the event nights when we can escape the kids. We love it. BYOB btw.\n",
      "Best sushi I've had in a LONG time! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and good atmosphere.\n",
      "Fish is very fresh and quality of sushi is just amazing! I love salmon sashimi and sushi. Also Alaska roll is good.\n",
      "I've been a fan of sushi for a few years now, and have tried it in NYC, CA, Hawaii and many other places. Hana Japanese is up there with the best of them. All of their sashimi selections are fresh, and fish is flown in frequently. The service is top notch and the sushi chefs are happy to chat with you. My favorites include saba, ika, and salmon skin. For those of you not looking to eat sushi, the rest of their menu is excellent. If you are in the mood for a traditional Japanese frozen treat, stop by and try the mochi ice cream! I recommend the mango. Hana is BYOB! Take advantage of this and pick up a bottle of sake on your way. Kanpai!\n",
      "God bless you Robert M. there are now 3 sushi places in Phoenix I will eat at!! There's something endearing to me about a sushi bar with no liquor license and no qualms about letting you bring a 6 pack in with you of whatever your little heart desires. Never been anywhere else similar to it, but I gotta be honest, I kinda dug it. Anyhoo, Robert was kind enough to bring me here in early June upon hearing I had never been there before and boy was I glad he did! Of course I drove past the restaurant several times before realizing it was in a strip mall, but I forgave the drab exterior the second I arrived and saw a packed restaurant aflurry with wait staff flying around every corner attentively serving their patrons. I was late (shocker) and our waiter was there to grab my sake out of my hand to chill it before my butt fully hit the seat. I was impressed. Next there was the fish. Holy fresh as the Pacific melt in your mouth fish! We shared the octopus salad which was pretty tasty considering I'm not a huge octopus fan (solely due to texture.) Next I had whatever the toro special of the day was which was freaking exquisite and Robert and I split a catepilar roll, also quite good. All in all my Hana experience was more than satisfactory. My biggest complaint living in Phoenix is a lack of fresh fish and sushi on demand and that was certainly not the case with Hana. I could've gone for a little more variety and adventure with their signature sushi rolls, but I really can't complain. Quality was definitely up to par and I will be back.\n",
      "This is the BEST sushi in town. HANDS DOWN. Not only is the fish is fresh, the wasabi is also fresh, AND it is BYOB. What more could you ask for!? Our favorite dish there is consistently the fresh carpaccio on special, but everything is good. Also, if you like eel, then this is the place to get it prepared perfectly since it is hard to find good eel in Arizona most of the time. Hana is a MUST try.\n",
      "This place has the best sushi in Phoenix. Make sure you bring your own saki, beer, or wine though...\n",
      "I tried this place out for the first time last night, and I have to say it was pretty good! The good: 1. The servers are really attentive and friendly. They make sure you get what you want and try to accommodate your needs. 2. They actually ask about food allergies!!! Because I have some, this was a big bonus for me. 3. You can tell the rice, fish, and vegetables in the sushi were fresh. The bad: 1. It's a tad on the expensive side; I could spend as much as I did on two people in another sushi restaurant with similar quality. The ugly: 1. It's a little crowded in the place because it is so small. Luckily I got a to-go order but it was still a little longer than had anticipated; I waited 7 minutes before leaving because it only took me 10 to get there and they said it would be 15. I got there about 20 minutes after I put in the order, and still waited for about another 15. It wasn't a ridiculous wait, and of course they were accommodating as mentioned previously, but still...I was hungry. That's about it! I would definitely eat here again!\n",
      "First time to Hana...it's in my hood and I've been wanting to try it. Favorable reviews from others, so my neighbors and I decided to go. Very good food (not up to par with some other Japanese spots we love in other cities, but still very good). We were having a wonderful time, enjoying conversation while paying the bill, and no longer than a few minutes after our bill was paid, the owner (we suspect) came over to our table and ASKED US TO LEAVE! \"I'm sorry, but there are people waiting outside....\" she said. We were stunned! First time in the place, had to leave to go buy wine as we didn't know there was no alcohol, but still ended up having a really good meal until the end. Now, it was 8:45pm on a Wednesday when we were asked to leave so the people waiting could sit (don't know why just we were asked to leave). We walked out to see three people (one party) waiting outside the door. The evening mood was totally changed. I've never been asked to leave...anywhere...even totally hip, very busy spots in Chicago, Denver, LA. Weird. Not sure if we'll go back which is too bad since the food was very good.\n",
      "Hands down the best sushi in town. Always fresh, interesting and inventive. Hana it's the kind of place that it will make you forget about being in Phoenix in the middle of the desert. A must for any sushi lover.\n",
      "Best salmon around! Hands down! They do serve okonomiyaki (when they have the ingredients for it.) And most Japanese street foods. Really amazing dessert menu. Better than Osaka's in Las Vegas. Except they don't have traditional seating. Call ahead if interested in Street food.\n",
      "This place is the DEAL. No kidding. THE DEAL. First, there's the sushi. I'm not a sushi snob, but I do like it fresh, melt in your mouth tasty and of course to not SMELL fishy. This place delivers. Every bite melts in your mouth like butter. Like fish butter! Which sounds gross, but just go with me here... It's yummy yummy all around, no matter what you get. I like the fancy rolls with all the stuff smushed in them, and this place has them all! In addition, it's bring your own wine! I love when I can just walk in a place with a bottle or two of wine and it's totally no big deal. Plus it makes the whole night more cost effective (unless of course you purchase some faaaaancy wines). The sushi is VERY reasonably priced, wonderful, you get it fast, and have I mentioned it is delicious? Cause it is. DELICIOUS. You will get weak in the knees, I promise you. The ONLY downside? The place is unbelievably tiny. So it fills up to capacity almost as soon as they open the doors. My advice is to get there AS SOON AS THEY OPEN! Telling you, I've gone there about five times, and the two times I got there RIGHT when they opened? I just walked right in and got a seat. Every time I haven't gotten there right as they opened? Had a LEAST a 45 minute wait. Believe me, it's still worth it. But as we are a society of unimaginably impatient people, make sure you get there right when they open! You won't regret it.\n",
      "The BEST sushi in Phoenix! They're not trying to be arrogant, they just serve quality food. They have a wonderful selection of the most fresh fish! I also love that it's BYOB. So they focus 100% on the food. And they have a great selection of none sushi items to cover everyone's palate. Plus the service is phenomenal! My personal fav is the Rainbow Carpaccio!\n",
      "Fish was very fresh which is always my number 1 priority. Presentation was nice. Authentic style Japanese restaurant. Service was fast and friendly. Went during lunch. Prices average. If you aren't into sushi they seemed to have plenty of kitchen items to choose from. Would give 4.5 stars but haven't figured out how to do that. My only annoyance was that the ventilation wasn't great so it was a tad smokey.\n",
      "I really should not be eating any sushi in Arizona. I blame myself for thinking that is was possible to get good sushi in Arizona. Staff was fine. It just did nothing special.\n",
      "Awesome very different then back home in Seattle Washington they should have one there we don't have one that are good. I would go again when I come back.\n",
      "Unlike Jiro I don't always dream of sushi. In fact our infrequent trips usually consist mainly of some safe rolls and some serious tempura. So when some good friends invited us out to Hana we were expecting of more and the same. What we got was something that stood from the sea of bland rolls that most of us experience. You have to elbow your way through countless hipsters to find a spot but by the time your first tray of flaming Salmon Sashimi arrives all is forgiven and you are well on your way to one of Phoenix's finest sushi experiences.\n",
      "Small and intimate. Gyoza just like the ones I make at home fresh ground pork, ginger and scallions. Staff friendly and helpful with recommendations.\n",
      "Have been wishing for a sushi bar in our neighborhood for a long, long time (especially since Ayako/Akita-ya at The Biltmore closed) - never could have imagined one would open so close to our house and be this great. The sushi gods have blessed us! We've eaten here regularly since they opened and have never had a bad meal. In fact, we've come to regard sushi chef Koji as a culinary genius (and would back him on Iron Chef any time!) Clever creations like Poki Chips and Tempura Mint Leaf are downright delicious, and he makes the best sashimi and hand rolls we've ever had. What's best about Hana for us is that this is a neighborhood sushi bar - not a trendy hot spot . Focus here is on the food - and in just the right way. Not overdone like so many sushi spots with countless fancy rolls on the menu - and yet also not overly traditional like so many old-school sushi spots where they only offer standard nigiri and such (which can be quite good, don't get me wrong, but isn't it nice to add a little flavor and creativity, too?) Being a neighborhood spot, Hana is quite small and can get crowded during peak hours. There's a small dedicated staff here and when crowded, service and food prep can be slow, it's only expected. We like to go later and sit at the sushi bar - to us that's always the best way to eat sushi anyway.\n",
      "SETS THE STANDARD FOR JAPANESE FOOD OUTSIDE JAPAN. _DON'T_ MISS IT. It's been a long time since my initial review of Hana. In fact it was one of my very first on Yelp. I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list, and those first visits did not fail to impress. I spoke about my personal scale of very good, excellent and life changing sushi. Indeed, Hana is always excellent, and i may say _usually_ life changing. Over the months Lori, Koji and family have shown me the the secrets of Japanese cuisine and the delight of specially-ordered ingredients, like: -- real Japanese Kobe beef. -- live ama ebi -- live scallops -- live giant clam -- daikon delight -- zaruten soba -- miso ramen -- monkfish pate (ankimo) -- oysters on the half shell -- bento box delight -- hamachi kama -- natto maki -- hawaiian walu sashimi -- shima mackerel -- wild salmon And that's just the specials. Hana SETS THE STANDARD for quality, every time in its -- Toro sashimi -- Fresh Salmon -- Maguro so red, i've heard it called beet red. -- Ika -- Tamago -- Seaweed Salad -- miso soup And if you're feeling adventurous, many Americanized-craziness dishes abound for your culinary quest: -- Mt. Fuji roll -- Volcano roll -- Pride roll -- Lobster roll -- Hana roll SERVICE has matured into an approachable and almost joyous pride to be able to share their food with their customers. Restauranting can be such a gritty grind, but Koji, Lori and the team present their carefully chosen ingredients with love and passion every day. Besides the excellent food, it is that passion which brings me back night after night, week after week. I can see that despite my instructions against it, you all HAVE told your friends about Hana. Please stop spreading the news! There just isn't enough room for us all. LOL. Enjoy. P.S. Check out their website for social-network specials on Facebook and Foursquare. By the way, don't bother trying to oust me as Foursquare Mayor; it's a lost cause!\n",
      "I think I have found my new favorite date night sushi joint.. Last week the illustrious David B. was recommending Hana to the ole plus one and I .. being the adventurous couple we are ,we invited our sushi friend Paul and family to join us to try somewhere new.. First Note : Hana is small groups are not their forte..although they nicely accommodated our large 7 person group. After being seated we took in all the specials on the board and began making sushi plans .. Second Note : Our waitress had a difficult time understanding our order, not sure if it was language barrier, ordering a little unusual , the larger party or what... daughter doesn't want any wasabi or garnishes on her sushi... after getting order ins , it wasn't long before some lovely sushi began coming our way. Unfortunate Waitress did not understand daughters order and it came with ta daa onion garnishes .. the owner (?) came out and rectified the situation with finesse.. We ordered for hubster and I : Hana roll a tasty roll with friend shrimp sticking up all over good stuff, rainbow roll clean and traditional, Vegas roll , nice touch because it was fried but not doughy or overly breaded like some places get it , and a tasty hot volcano roll , not the fave but still a good roll, we also had tako salad our favorite extra at japanese restaurants , theirs is a sweet yet vinegary concoction that me happy loved it.. Friend Paully ordered a seared maguro dinner that looked tasty. All the food was refreshing and delicious but here is where it went wrong Third Note , traditionally in a restaurant when you have a big party of people done with their food and they are staring at the wait staff and fidgeting with the empty plates and suck on the ice cubes you bring them the check ...guess our waitress did not get that memo... we sat and sat.. finally the womenfolk took the kids across the street for Mary Coyle ice cream to let the men wait in peace. Fourth Note, how do you negotiate the 20% gratuity already added in when the service wasn't up to par? Well once again owner ? Lyn came to our rescue and rectified the situation .. Hats off to Lyn who did an outstanding job of smoothing over a bad situation. Because of her we will go back and give Hana another try just with a smaller group and not the same waitress. Oh and BTW they use Sweet Republic for their ice cream .. got give that a try next time...\n",
      "Over-priced. Food was just okay. The sushi rolls definitely had less fish in them or on them compared to most sushi restaurants. The service was great though. I won't go back.\n",
      "decent sushi, udon noodles and service. The sushi was fresh, but not extra ordinary. My search for a good sushi place continues.\n",
      "Nice sushi. Small building. Not designed for large groups. I went with a group of 7, and had it not been a Wednesday night, I'm sure we would have had to wait a long time. As it was, we waited about 30 minutes, which I think is totally acceptable. Because it is small, and packed with people and tables, the place was very loud. It is also BYOB - so make sure you pack some! About the food - we ordered A LOT. Appetizers, salads, soups, hot entrees, sashimi and a boat full of sushi. Everything was tasty. My only complaint was that all of the food arrived at once. We didn't have any room on our table to hold everything, and I would have preferred to eat in courses, even if they were ad-hoc courses. I love the \"neighborhood hang out\" feel that Hana had. There were obviously many regulars, and it felt friendly and casual. If it was closer to my house, I would certainly return, but I don't think it is remarkable enough for a long drive (for those in the east valley).\n",
      "Decent Japanese restaurant, but pricey. Sushi selection is very limited also.\n",
      "Not bad, not bad at all. I went to Moira sushi the other weekend, I would choose Hana over that place any day. They have Oolong tea.. I love that tea. The only issue about this place though is that out of all the rolls we got (Spicy Tuna, Alaskan, Las Vegas, Volcano), the only one that I would get again would only be the spicy tuna. The Spicy Tuna had so much flavor and I was like YESSSS! so good. I wish I got one of those sushi boats though..that looked awesome. My friends loved all the rolls though, I am just very picky. Anyways, if you go here, I recommend the Spicy Tuna roll..and I guess all the other rolls (since my friends thought it was amazing). I'm pretty sure there were other rolls that are great though, and the service was awesome. I will definitely come back here again.\n",
      "Arrived at 6pm on Saturday to a small wait of about 5 mins. They were pretty packed so I'm not complaining what so ever. We were greeted immediately and offered water while we waited. Upon sitting we ordered the tonkatsu ramen and received our side salad within 5 mins. The ramen was delicious! Everything from the ramen, meat, and soup was perfect. Definitely would recommend adding the egg and chili powder. Would definitely come back! The staff was quick and efficient and I had a very pleased experience.\n",
      "After just having sushi in Hawaii I was worried about coming back to Arizona and having sushi. However the freshness of the fish at this restaurant maybe want to have straight Sashimi. I requested a sushi platter for $40 for two of us and the fish was amazing especially the scallops and salmon! We also had fresh Wasabi that left Dave wondering why everyone doesn't have it. It was delicious. And the staff was really fun and attentive to us old farts. We will be back\n",
      "The Hana Bento Box for lunch is ridiculously good and filling! And the sushi is really fresh!\n",
      "Awesome place to go, but if its the weekend expect a wait as it is small. If you get enough sushi, you get a boat! Prices are decent, spending about 50 for two. BYOB.\n",
      "I really liked Hana. I'm not sushi expert, but I know what's tasty. I'm not super adventerous with sushi, but the basics were good...the tuna sashimi, the spicy tuna roll, etc. I was disappointed that it seemed a little pricey. Lunch for 2 was $37, that seemed a bit much, but hey, it was a business lunch. The servers were really nice and it's not a \"scene\" which I was happy about, but I don't know how long that will last. I love Central Phoenix.\n",
      "I really enjoyed my trip to Hana. I got three rolls that turned out divinely, including one baked roll, and the sashimi was very good as well. My favorite part of the visit was exploring the items on the white board about the kitchen--we ordered about five of them, and each one was unique, delicate, and delicious. Go to explore, not if you want standard fare. BYOB is a touch annoying but I suppose not so terrible if you plan ahead for it.\n",
      "What a disappointment! After such glowing Yelps, maybe I was expecting too much. I have to qualify the review by saying that the only thing we ordered from the regular menu was gyoza. Those were fair, but could have passed for the frozen kind you get from the Asian grocery and pan fry yourself. As for the sushi: both rolls and nigiri were covered with a thick layer of scallions. If the quality of the fish it good, there's really no need for embellishment. The fish itself didn't taste fishy or old, but it lacked any flavor at all, subtle or otherwise. It had a high water content that made it seem like it might have been (gasp) recently defrosted. This was backed up by the temperature...much too cold. The sushi rice (yes, it makes a big difference) was a dense and glutinous mass. You shouldn't have to chew rice that long to get it down your throat. I gave two stars: one because it wasn't that there was anything there to actually make you sick; it just wasn't what sushi is supposed to be, never mind what it can be when done right. And two because the atmosphere was neighborhoody and casual, not trendy. the waitstaff was really friendly, so much so we tried to justify the place to each other at first (a la maybe they were having a bad day, or maybe the next piece of sushi will be better) but no luck. The search continues.\n",
      "High quality sushi, a great staff, and an all around joy to dine at. The place is small and fills up quickly, so either include a wait into your plans or show up early. Alcohol is BYOB as they do not have a liquor license. It can get somewhat noisy form conversation, but they do not play loud music like some other places in the valley like 'Ra'. Their tako salad is wonderful, the best I've had since Zen32 closed. Tuna Tataki is also outstanding.\n",
      "Really limited sushi bar and no alcohol however a pretty good Japanese menu if you don't want sushi.\n",
      "Have been to Hana a handful of times and continue to be impressed. It is the freshest sushi I have had in Phoenix. It tends to fall on the pricier side, but the quality is absolutely worth it. It's also a BYOB, which is great. The servers are attentive and efficient, and can provide lots of information and suggestions. Don't forget to check out the specials board behind the sushi bar for some interesting choices. The menu seems a bit more traditional, but exquisitely executed. The pickled wasabi is fantastic. I recommend using it with any sashimi. This is not a venue where you need to drench anything in soy sauce and wasabi. The noodle dishes are delicious as well. And don't miss out on dessert. They have selections from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale that are brilliant.\n",
      "We have been here few times , it's consistently good. Food is amazing and sashimi is fresh, service great. It gets busy here early so we would recommend to get there as soon as it opens. Its BYOB , so don't forget your beer or wine.\n",
      "Ahhhh....Dominick Armato, your Az Republic review of this little piece of yummy heaven was spot on!! As per your advice, I ordered the special Hana Egg dish that's batter fried and served perfectly poached with a divine sauce. Took a lot of effort to not lick the plate when I was done. And my husband who never willingly orders salad as his entree was superbly pleased with the Gyuniku Tataki - luscious slices of prime beef over crisp greens. There was NOTHING left on his plate, and it was a large serving. Our teenager devoured the massive Yakibuta Ramen soup dish, but it was so huge we have leftovers for tomorrow (or a midnight snack tonight!). The pleasant surprise of a little platter of rice balls & fried wonton \"chips\" for our little one before we placed our orders was a lovely touch that she certainly enjoyed. Definitely worth the drive from Chandler, and we will surely return!\n",
      "Sooo many better places to get sushi. Very limited selection. Tried to roles and sushi wasnt that great. Also tried a Japanese rice noodle dish with shrimp. It had a funky taste. On top of that we sat outside because of limited seating inside and we got several mosquito bites. Better Japanese restaurants out there.\n",
      "I have had good and bad experiences at Hana in the past, and overall, I like their sashimi choices, but last night was the final straw. The wait staff is very hit and miss, with most being fun and friendly but a few being the typical 'cooler than thou' hipster wanna-be types that seem to plague Central Phoenix restaurants these days. I can overlook the BYOB (which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish) and the sometimes attitudey service, and even the ho-hum rolls offered (nothing special, really). But what I cannot overlook is the ridiculously overpriced items and the blatant overcharging. My partner and I were going to order the oysters, and when we were told it was $9 for 2 oysters we politely declined with more than a bit of amusement. 2 oysters, really? Durants, which has amazingly fresh oysters, presented incredibly, and is one of the priciest restaurants in the area charges $13 for a half dozen- in a far better atmosphere. Ok, so then I order the Chirashi bowl, which apparently is not on the menu but they will do it anyway. I always get the Chirashi as it is my favorite item at sushi restaurants, and Hana does a very nice one indeed- for $35!!! Of course you don't know this until AFTER you get the check since it's not listed anywhere. I understand that I ordered it and I should have asked, but honestly I have ordered this a hundred times from SF to LA to NY (and even at HANA before!!) and have NEVER seen it more than about $20-22. Locally, it goes for $19 at Stingray, and $17 at Sakana (which btw is much better). Anyway, I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this, but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time, they think they can get away with it. We'll see what happens now with Stingray opening up nearby, and Moira downtown, along with a few other newbies scheduled for openings in 2010. Competition is a great thing! Some advice for sushi lovers: it's a bit of a drive, but Sakana is still hands down the best sushi in town- with a full bar and dinner for two in the $50 range, including drinks.\n",
      "The agedashi tofu here is the perfect vehicle for the sweet mirin broth! Would recommend to people who like eating at good restaurants.\n",
      "Great little place that reminds me of one of my favorite places in downtown Los Angeles (see review for Komasa). This place is not your typical sushi place it definitely is small and seating is tight, no teppan tables. Remember to byob and even though there is typically a wait they move fast.\n",
      "I recently dropped by one of my favorite local, family owned and operated restaurants to warm my belly with delicious hot food. Why do I emphasize the word hot here? Well, This particular restaurant happens to be Hana Japanese eatery, my favorite place for sushi in Arizona. On this particular night, the mercury had dipped into the forties and I was in the mood for for something to counter the chill. I tweeted @HanaJapanese asking what was recommended and commented that i'd happily put my stomach into their hands. What followed was simply perfect. Miso Ramen A large, piping hot bowl of Miso Ramen soup was first brought to the table. Steam from the delicate, flavorful broth wafted into my nose causing my mouth to water. Generous amounts of ramen noodles paired with scallion, subtle spices and pork absolutely hit the spot. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor, texture and warmth this lovely bowl of soup delivered and have since found myself craving more. While doing damage to the aformentioned ramen, my server brought over a propane fired hibachi grill along with a tray of assorted vegetables and strips of raw steak. The grill was lighted and I was instructed to add the vegetables (asparagus, pumpkin, okra, long beans and portobello mushrooms) and then grill the meat to my desired temperature. Forget going to kitchy chains like Benihana or Sapporo where the show is more important than the food, grilling it yourself using quality ingredients and truly becoming a part of the experience is where it's at! (not to mention, everyone seemed to be ooh-ing and ahh-ing at what was going on at my table adding to the over-all cool factor). Hana Hibachi Steak Hana Sauteed Lobster While the miso ramen was warming and hit the spot and the Hana Hibachi steak couldn't possibly have been better, it was the Hana Lobster sauté that really made my night. Tender chunks of well seasoned, perfectly sautéed lobster served with pieces of chopped asparagus lay before me begging to be snapped up by my eager chopsticks. I just ate and smiled, you have to order this dish and enjoy it to understand how good it really is. I simply must mention the dessert here, green tea mochi in this case. I am at a rare lack of words to describe the texture of this little gem. Green tea ice cream encased in a flour and sweet rice dough that was firm, slippery, sweet and refreshing all at the same time. I hate using word like \"delicious\" to describe food because it doesnt really tell you anything about the experience but I will here because this mochi is a little weird, fanciful and yes, DELICIOUS! Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple, quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important, while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly, the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer, sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own.\n",
      "Some great things about Hana: * A nicely put together sushi bar that has all the markings of become a big favorite amongst Phoenicians, without being scene-y or plasticky trendoid like several other sushi places in Phoenix and Scottsdale. It truly feels like a neighborhood gem. A sushi Cheers, if you will * Mr. Sushi Rock Star (TM Curtis) was definitely on his game today. Hamachi and spicy tuna rolls didn't only taste excellent, with awesome quality fish, but they were A+ in presentation, too. Even though this was only lunch. On 7th Ave. And blocks away from a middle of the road Target. Mr. Sushi Rock Star is a jovial guy and more than happy to explain anything he's making or even to suggest new items to customers. The folks sitting at the bar definitely looked like they were getting treat after treat, including 4 rolls of different colored fish eggs in each. * The chicken bento was excellent and the portions of chicken very generous. I also tried a few new things in their side sections - some desserty kind of items that I couldn't figure out what they were exactly (one looks like a slice of squash but it was definitely sweet and mochi-like.) * Really friendly service. Although a bit frenetic at times, but they were very courteous and happy to answer any questions (such as \"Why do those people get served their sushi in a giant wooden boat?\" \"Because it looks great when a big order of sushi can fit on a big wooden boat. Why not?\" \"Word. That's pretty awesome.\") I'd say the downside of Hana is, like Curtis said, if you're facing the front door and it's lunchtime, you tend to get blinded by all the light streaming in. It's fairly dark inside so the contrast in brightness is pretty huge. I also don't see them being able to accomodate groups larger than 4 at a table, especially during lunch or dinner rush. All in all, though, I just hope Hana remains as an unpretentious top quality spot for sushi in town. I'm bracing for the onslaught once AZ Central and the New Times get a hold of this place, because it really is too good to pass up and the hype will eventually get there. But as long as they keep girls with names like Taffy from being their servers and keep Linkin Park off their playlist, I think they'll be A-ok. Will definitely be back for more. 4 stars. (Star #5 will wait until I have a full-on sushi experience for dinner sometime).\n",
      "I came here for lunch with my mother and sister. It was the middle of the afternoon, so we did not take advantage of the BYOB. Sadly. However, the sushi was delicious! We tried the volcano roll, the caterpillar roll, and various sashimi and nigiri. Everything was fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back for dinner with a nice bottle of something special :)\n",
      "Hands down one of the top sushi restaurants in the entire Phoenix area. Friendly staff, fresh sushi, reasonable prices...and getting boatloads of sushi (literally)...just awesome! Hana is a definite must if you're looking for great sushi in Phoenix.\n",
      "Popular Japanese eatery so be prepared for a wait, especially on the weekends. Sushi menu was a bit limited and most rolls were very similar, but still very good. Sashimi was very fresh and excellent. Service was prompt and friendly, atmosphere inviting. I will be back.\n",
      "Ammonia-scented noodles mean I am not coming back here for ramen. Apparently, according to the Internet, this occurs when noodles are made with alkali water and the preparing kitchen doesn't change out the water frequently (or, I imagine, uses too little water). First time in my life I've encountered this, and I've had a LOT of ramen and saimin. Wait staff was apologetic but didn't offer to comp the meal. I won't be back.\n",
      "I always enjoy Hana's. It's BYOB and makes for a fun night with friends, family and/or your significant other. They will chill your beer or wine for you while you enjoy dinner too, which is nice. The sushi here is consistently good, which is not always the easiest to find in Phoenix. There is also a fun element, you can get sushi served on a boat with flames, always fun to take out of town guests or a group of friends to enjoy. The squid salad is a favorite dish here. All of the varieties of sushi I have had here are always reliably good and the fresh. It is a smaller restaurant, so expect that you might have a little wait time. The service is sometimes a little hit or miss, I have had terrific wait staff and not so terrific, but overall this is a great go-to.\n",
      "Life is awesome when you come here...not only does the food excel all expectations... The staff treats you like family! Leaving with a full tummy and memories of much laughter and fun times...Kudos to all the staff..you guys rock!\n",
      "This was a very nice eating experience over all. The staff at the front was friendly and comforting. Luckily there was just one open seat at the bar. Once seated i was greeted by a nice young waitress who took care of me the whole time. Great atmosphere and great presentation. However, the most important part, is the food. I was given a free rabit-food appetizer (that's a salad). It was pretty tastey and a very nice touch to the rest of my meal. There was only one ramen item on the menu, but when i asked the waitress, she listed about 5 i could choose from. I got the Tonkatsu. It came out farely quick but once it was in front of me, I was greeted by a pretty gnarly smell. How disapointing. It smelt like stinky pork that lived in its own filth. I'm brave, so I dove in anyway. I did eat every last drop. Not bad at all, but i dared not go further. Check came quick and I was on my way with a smile. Come here for the atmosohere and the service. Not so much the food.\n",
      "I haven't even started my meal yet and I can already tell it will be epic!!! For Thursday dinner decided to sit at the bar and the sweetest older woman was assigned as my server. She answered all of my questions and I took another Yelpers advice and consulted the Specials board. (note: the price of the specials were the same price as what was on the sushi menu sooooooo...lolol) This cozy little place was really hoppin' and packed from the time I sat down to the time I left with a happy, fat little belly :)\n",
      "What a disservice I have done to not have reviewed Hana previously! This is my hands down favorite sushi spot...no question! First, the staff is so incredibly nice! This is a family run operation (Laurie, her brother, her mom, her dad and so on) whom are so welcoming and friendly! They always remember my GF BF and I and make amazing accommodations for his wheat allergy! Plus, it is a BYOB with no corkage which always makes everything better! Next, the fish is by far the freshest in the valley! It absolutely just melts in your mouth and the portion sizes are perfect! If you sit at a table, you also have your sushi served in a boat...who doesn't love a boat?!? Also, the rice is a very good stickiness and always cooked to perfection! My GF BF and I have also ventured off the sushi menu and tried their shabu shabu (swish swish) Sunday night special and the most amazing Asian dish I have ever had called Gyu Don Nabe (it's on the kitchen specials board). Simply amazing!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It's not a huge place so be prepared to wait sometimes, but it is completely worth it!! Can't wait to get my fix again!\n",
      "In today's episode of I Can't Believe I Haven't Yelped That Yet, I get to tell you about my GO TO sushi joint, Hana. Yes. There's no liquor license. Yes it's BYOB. Most of the time I don't even bring liquor with me and still have the time of my life. That's how truly phenomenal Hana is. Don't go to get wasted. Go to enjoy your meal. The only items I've had here consist of sushi, so if you're looking for recommendations on cooked food, this is not the review for you. Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar. I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them. Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too. Hana's a small joint. Sometimes there's a little bit of a line. Nevertheless though, it never seems to ever be so crowded anyone gets annoyed. The staff is efficient, and the sushi is worth it.\n",
      "OK this was a pretty good not 5 stars put almost small with about 15 tables and the Susi bar service was good they could of explained what was different about them then other Susi bars because they do bento boxes for lunch and dinner I wish I would of order one of them but that's for next time the food that we had was really good yakisoba was one of the best that I have had the Susi was normal the tempera ice was fantastic will be back\n",
      "Get the Omakase (It means I will entrust you with my food). Literally mindblowing if you don't mind shelling out a benjamin Koji-son will rock your world. Also ask what fish they have in fresh. It's one of the very few sushi restaurants with fresh never frozen fish. (That also means it's not shipped frozen) Insane food and incredibly small location so plan ahead and expect a wait.\n",
      "What Happened??? I have been to Hana Japanese Eatery twice, the first time it was really pretty good, the second time, really, really bad. The sushi the second time around seemed not fresh, and the rolls very hastily prepared. We left most of our sashimi and rolls uneaten...I will try again, but I have definitely experienced two different restaurants on two different trips.\n",
      "This place could be better. I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs making sushi did not even speak to me. It's weird they spoke to every other person that came in that sat next to me...Lol and I'm Asian. The food is over priced for my taste considering there are better sushi locations in Phoenix. I found the fish to be fresh enough. I had a bento for lunch that cost $16. They do have specials but nothing on the lunch menu would make you feel is at a better price. Too expensive for the crappy location it is in. I wouldn't go back to this place because I didn't feel the quality of the food matched the ridiculous prices. There are so many better tasting and better quality sushi spots elsewhere. Good luck!\n",
      "Hana probably has the freshest sushi in Phoenix. They always have specials posted above the sushi bar and what they serve regularly is beyond delicious as well. It is BYOB, but they open it for you and how good the food is MORE than makes up for such a minor inconvenience, (if it could even be considered inconvenient). The service is always polite and prompt as well. I love Hana Sushi and my only wish was that it was closer to my neck of the woods!!!!\n",
      "Went here with colleagues, first note of business: it's BYOB, so you can bring your own beer and/or wine. Now to the sushi...top notch, top notch. I travel a lot, and sushi is always something I look for. Was not expecting to find such a great establishment in Phoenix of all places, but, the rolls were unbelievably good, and the sashimi was fresh. Our waitress was very informative, friendly, and made us feel at home!! Will I be back....yes!!\n",
      "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this wonderful restaurant sooner. Hana is by far the BEST Japanese food experience I have had. The Why: Fresh, clean, and best selected fish in the state, as far as I am concerned. This is the place for sashimi & nigiri. Rolls are good too, but it's the select fish that catapults this restaurant into the stratosphere. Be sure and try the fresh oysters. INCREDIBLE! The How: Family run by those who know seafood and how to put it all together. The Where: Centrally located in Phoenix at 7th Ave. & Missouri. Be sure to get there early as you may have a wait, but it's totally worth it. This place is a destination for the discerning sushi patron. BYOB.\n",
      "What an experience. A sign outside the door warning you about limited seating at the sushi bar, so you need to sit where they tell you. As I walk in my friend was sitting alone at the sushi bar and motioned for me to sit on his right hand side when the maitre d at told me that I I was supposed to set in the last seat, which was the left of my friend. As I proceeded to sit down on the right hand side of my friend the maitre'd rushed right up and said no you sit at the end. You have to understand, we were the only two customers in the entire restaurant. Plus, my friend ordered two orders of the miso soup and when they brought them they seemed surprised and said we thought this was just for you. meaning my friend Anyway, we were both so uncomfortable that we walked out of the restaurant immediately and plan never to go back. I can't tell you if the food is any good. I went there several years ago and it was so so. The atmosphere and the service leaves a lot to be desired. My friend who is there first also mentioned that as he entered the restaurant the maitre d said that he had to ask the manager before you could even sit him and this is in an empty restaurant Bizarre place. One star rating only because I have to.\n",
      "Great sushi rolls and BYOB! Very friendly staff. Three for lunch $25 per person including a generous tip. Love this place!\n",
      "5 stars for the special fishes. The wild caught salmon, the ono, and a couple other atypical fish they had this past weekend. It's been months since I've been here (I'm wondering WHY it took so long to come back). Their fresh fish has always been the highest quality and fresh. I'm sashimi all the way - no rice to muss things up, and no desire for most of the cooked stuff - so my rating is really based on the fish experience. And the salmon skin - excellent rolls and hand rolls. I have found few, if any places in the valley with as good selection and quality of fish. Prices are certainly not cheap, but the if you are all about plain slices of raw fish, it's is way better than the cheaper places.\n",
      "What a splendid surprise! I had not heard of this place until I went for my brother-in-law's birthday and man was it great! Small, out of the way and right across the street from Channel 3's station...What a gem! The staff are extremely friendly and hilarious...Jokes are thrown about like so much fish at the Pike Place Market. Sarcasm so thick you could cut it with a knife. First things first..... Food: When any food comes out on a wooden boat, you already get bonus points, but when the food is excellent, it's even better. We ordered the volcano, spicy tuna, Vegas, Hana peche, and caterpillar rolls and were amazed at their freshness and speed. Kudos to the boat with a flame! BYOB: Bring what you want and they refrigerate the rest...No more complaining about drink selection: bring or shut up! 5 stars for ambiance, personality and a waiter who doesn't mind a mint being thrown at him!!!!\n",
      "I have eaten sashimi at many restaurants and this place is one of the best. Great place that doesn't look like much from the outside. Don't let the looks fool you. It's truly one of the best restaurants for fresh fish in the country. And it happens to be in Phoenix! We had two giant plates of sashimi. I can recommend any of the fish. We didn't have any rolls but I am sure those are good as well. Oh... Bring your own alcohol!! They don't serve any.\n",
      "If you're a sushi fan, you'll love Hana! It's got all of the components of a great meal: variety, value and ambiance. Ok, maybe it's a little light on the ambiance side, but they offer outdoor seating, the indoor area is above average for the non-ubertrendy sushi restaurant category, and they were festively decorated for Halloween, which is cool in my book. After looking at the menu online, I was a little skeptical at all of the glowing reviews. I'll give you a little secret: the best menu items are the specials that aren't on the menu! The highlight of the meal was the Walu tataki - at around $20, it comes with maybe 8 thinly sliced, seared pieces. Not cheap, but worth it because it's melt in your mouth delicious! I would've ordered $100 of it but refrained so we could sample other things :) Other standout items were the squid salad (not chewy at all) and the yellowtail sashimi (really fresh and a huge portion). With some iced teas and a couple of rolls, the meal came to around $40 per person. That's about normal for a sushi dinner, and we preferred our meal here to other top (Yelp) rated sushi restaurants, like Toyama. Outside of Ra's Sunday night happy hour, this will probably become our go-to sushi spot :)\n",
      "it is so goooood!! they've got great vegan and vegetarian options and they're super nice.\n",
      "This place is going to be our sushi joint here in Arizona. The wait staff is amazing, shoutout to Hannah for being the hostess with the mostest. Every single thing we had here was impeccably done. Also BYOB so how can you beat that. There's this dish, fried red snapper with green onion and this soy sauce mixture. I have no idea what the word is for it in Japanese but you have to get it. It's the best bite I had the entire time there. I would definitely go for a mix of sushi bar and kitchen when ordering or you'll miss out on something wonderful. Hannah also gave us real wasabi which was bomb. I will 100% be coming back with everyone I know!!! 10/10 would recommend.\n",
      "Fresh wasabi blows your mind!! Came by for lunch. Huge plate of sushi for 8.00. Fresh tasting. Family owned business. Will definitely stop in again.\n",
      "Love, love, love Hana. We don't go here super often but everytime we do we say the same thing....\".why don't we come here more?\" The service has always been great and the staff super welcoming. We usually do a cornucopia of sides. The salad with the avocado and shaved parmesean, californai rolls, a noodle dish and the marinated pork appetizer.....yum and $34.00! Enough for 3 but 2 of us ate it. We took some friends their for lunch who lived for years in the San Juan Islands....experts on 'fresh fish'. They loved it. The Bento lunch boxes are great and there are so many to pick from. \"Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name\" and Hana is the neighborhood place to try. The BYOB is a nice touch and that doesn't seem to be changing. You can get served outside now and even take you wine out there. It's a little lackluster out there but gives that kind of 'urban feel' to your evening. Plan to wait on Friday and Saturday and I wouldn't suggest a group inside....tight space.\n",
      "Hana is my new favorite special occasion sushi place. The reason why I say special occasion is because of how pricey it can be, but you get what you pay for.\n",
      "So this is a Japanese-owned sushi place. That might seem like a silly thing to mention but I've been to so many Korean-owned sushi places lately that I take notice when a place is actually truly Japanese. I don't mind the Korean places just like I don't really care if a pizza place is run by Albanians instead of actual Italians. But there are some menu items that you will only find in a Japanese run sushi place. The Japanese run places are less concerned with all sorts of fancy \"rolls\" and are likely to give you smaller sushi pieces because sushi is supposed to be \"hitoguchi\" - meaning one bite and it all fits in your mouth. Some of the Korean sushi places give you huge pieces of fish that you can no way fit all in your mouth in one bite. Sure you get your money's worth but that's really not the point. So I've been coming to Hana off and on for quite some time. Sometimes the place is too crowded and our group ends up sitting outside. It's nice if it isn't too hot or windy because it is much more quiet than in the actual restaurant. For appetizers, the kaki is pretty good if you're into oysters. Agedashi tofu is also usually a good choice. I was a little disappointed with their yakibuta - I guess only because I had a killer variation at another restaurant which I can't help comparing it to. Sushi is always pretty decent and fresh tasting here. It's pretty much what I come here for. I just check off the items on the sushi list and let them roll in. If you get the eel sushi, that is usually the last item that comes because it is considered a little sweet because of the sauce - so that's like a dessert. Speaking of desserts, I always get the Hana An Mitsu - aloe vera, mandarin oranges, blueberries, and red bean paste with a cherry on top. Most restaurants won't have this but this is definitely a very Japanese dessert. Tottemo Oishii desu. Parking is easy to find since it's a mall but there's a bunch of restaurants in the same mall so you might not be parking close to the restaurant.\n",
      "Even though they don't serve Sake, they do a great job as a bring your own place. The location is small, so if you have a large group you might have to wait a little while to be seated. It's definitely worth it though. As I look at the reviews of other Yelpers, I can't help but think that they're just ordering the wrong things. I mean, good sushi is about good fish. It really kind of bothers me when people say \"I love sushi\" and then either pick the fish off the roll, order something without fish entirely, or order something that's going to be drenched in some American sauce. The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest. I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs, it's not the best, but it's the best I've had in the valley. And, I don't know what Jenn H. (review below) ordered to get something covered in mayo? We always get a variety of different things and I have yet to have anything with any weird sauce on it. I mean, I've probably been there 5 or 6 times, and I can't remember any sauce on anything. When my dad and stepmom came to visit from L.A., they liked this place so much that they actually wanted to go two nights in a row.\n",
      "I like what Hana is not as much as what it is. It's not a concept. There arent any consultants or flowery speeches or aquariums flown in from Hawaii. Just quality fish prepared and served by what looks to be a talented and gracious extended Japanese family. And by quality I dont mean it's Bluefin of The Highest Order or The Stylings of Nobuo, necessarily, just that Hana's stock is better than most places you're likely to walk into around here. This Sonoran cheapskate thinks prices are generally fair for what you get. $16 Umi No Sachi is a lightly dressed spring mix topped with a dozen or so sizable slabs of sashimi. Yeah, a dozen. Big noodle soup bowls with tempura sides are $9-10. An appetizer of eight or so small fried oysters, crunchy outside, moist and briny within, was only $6.95. Tables are too close together and the whole strip mall vibe is kinda cramped, if that sort of thing bothers you. The downside of BYOB is that the drink selection isnt very interesting. All coastal cities have Japanese joints like this, but I'm delighted these folks decided to set up shop in CenPho. If you need the cushy banquette and garish aquarium, go to Scottsdale. If you need to impress a jaded epicure, try Nobuo at Heritage Square. If you just want a satisfying, authentic and accessible Japanese fish fix, pay a visit to Hana.\n",
      "This is my go to sushi restaurant. I love the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) that is grilled. They don't have it all the time, but get it when you can. Everything is good here. Nigiri, sashimi, rolls, it's great. They do all their own butchering. And if you have non-sushi eating companions, there are plenty of noodle, soup and such dishes that are wonderful. You can take everyone there. It's BYOB, so grab your favorite sake or beer and head in! I've never had bad service there either. Always great.\n",
      "I was feeling a little bit under the weather, so what's a better cure than a nice bowl of ramen in 115 degree weather? I know, it sounds absurd, but weather doesn't exactly dictate my choice for fuel. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, and buy did I make a good choice. The ramen came with a side salad, and for $2 more, you could add a soft boiled egg. The flavor of the broth was bold but not overwhelming. The ramen noodles were not too soft, and not too hard.. They were cooked just right! The portion was also quite generous, as I was completely stuffed after finishing the bowl. The pieces of sliced pork were thick and tender, with a hint of sweetness. The service was also on point. My water cup was never empty, and my table never filled with finished dishes. I'm excited to come back to try the sushi there.. Maybe next time when I'm not overly stuffed.\n",
      "The best sushi in Phoenix!!! I am originally from northern California and I have had some amazing Japanese, but Hana is one of the best I've ever had. Small, but cozy with great service and actual Japanese people making your food (something you never see in Arizona). I take all my out of town guest here.\n",
      "I have no idea how this place doesn't have a solid 5-star rating. The fish is always incredibly fresh and impeccable in its preparation. Where do they even get scallops that fresh?? We have never been disappointed with Hana. We recommend asking for \"omakase\" or \"chef's choice.\" The chef always picks the most delicious and interesting fish of the day. If you like sashimi and flavor, and aren't interested in filling your gullet with rice, this can be your place!\n",
      "I have to admit, the stellar Yelp reviews may have caused my expectations to get a little out of control. A few of the issues: *Service felt \"hover-y.\" It's hard to have a relaxing dinner when it feels like people are waiting for you to leave. *Sushi did not taste terribly fresh. We may have hit an off night but I was a bit disappointed with the quality. *The sushi menu is fairly limited and unfortunately, I didn't see the four rolls on special written on the blackboard until after we ordered. The staff *were* very nice and it was a pleasant enough experience but given other options available, I probably wouldn't return.\n",
      "Excited to try this place for the first time as we're visiting Arizona with the family. CoZy lighting and loud atmosphere with enthusiastic eaters. Ordered ramen with eggs and pork bone broth. Definitely worth the wait and coming back again.\n",
      "Four words. Plum wine ice cream. Sushi was delish, nom nom.\n",
      "The sushi here is some of the best I've had in Phoenix. I was a fiercely loyal patron of Zen 32 until it closed, and while Hana isn't as upscale as Zen 32 was, I think the food speaks for itself. The fish was fresh and lovely and the squid salad was probably the best I've ever had. I thought it was odd that the edamame was served cold, but everything else was on point. Hana is super small and it is easy to feel crammed like sardines in there. I like that it's BYOB because it cuts down on the bill. The service was spectacular and prompt even on a very busy Saturday night. I totally recommend Hana for a casual sushi experience. Excellent food and service.\n",
      "This is our favorite sushi spot by far! It makes for the perfect date night. On our last visit we rode our bikes there, and sat at the sushi bar. The owner greeted us with a warm smile and a great sense of humor. She made us feel special and welcome. The food was amazing to look at, and to devour (as always)! We ordered the gringo rolls - caterpillar, dragon, vegas. Simply delicious! We left feeling satisfied and happy. Sushi is perfect for bike riding. You don't feel too overstuffed to ride home. We aren't regulars, but I think that's going to change.\n",
      "It wasn't that great. Actually, the best part was the free chip they gave us in the beginning. We had a few sushi rolls. The tuna had almost no taste. I think there was cucumber wrapped in with it, all I could taste was water. Maybe the fish was too fresh? If you want to argue freshness, I stand with Yasuda. I was charged $9 for an avocado roll. I should have asked if I would be charged a specialty roll price but still, it feels like price gouging no matter what. The baked salmon roll wasn't very good either. I don't know what they did to make it so gross. Added the sauce at the wrong time? It looked like melted cheese, it makes the taste and texture just a little off. Which really screws up the entire roll considering it's covered in it. Just imagine, thinned out mayo, heated until it begins to congeal. Then the whole thing fell apart. I've always been told that the quality of the rice and the chef's ability to roll is strongly reflected in how well It holds together. I've never had a roll fall apart quite as bad as this one did. It was kind of expensive too. I miss eating sushi in Chandler. It must just be the strong Asian community in that part of town. We spent over 45 on a small thing of edamame and 4 rolls. I could have spent so much less for better food somewhere else. Maybe the specialty entrees are where it's at here but honestly I'm not going to take the risk of dropping 20 dollars at a place that couldn't make a decent spicy tuna roll.\n",
      "Honestly I think this is the best sushi place in Phoenix (at least out of the places I've tried, which is A LOT). It is a BYOB place, with a somewhat awkard patio in front. However, the sushi itself is very fresh, and the rolls are packed abundantly with fish instead of being 90% rice and cucumber. I have also had their Ramen, Gyoza, and salads. Everything has tasted authentic and fresh. Boom.\n",
      "I wasn't impressed by Hana. Our service was extremely slow, we were about to give up and leave because our waitress took so long to take our order. We ordered ebi tempura and Asari Sake Mushi as appetizers. The tempura was a bit bland. The asari sake mushi had a good flavor to it, but the clams were extremely gritty. Most of their sushi on their menu are basic rolls. It was a bit overpriced. We prefer other sushi restaurants in the valley over Hana, we probably won't be back.\n",
      "Most definitely some of the best sushi in town, in my book. Small place, but quick to get seated because it's usually just me and one or two others. We typically like to get seated at the bar. Service is great! We always bring in our own bottle of wine, and just catch up on life. The atmosphere rocks. It just has a really upbeat feel to it, and I mean, come on --- awesome sushi! Anyone who says otherwise is crazy! You get what you pay for. TRY THE UNI! Always fresh when I go :)\n",
      "The sushi wasn't bad by any means, but i definitely felt like it was really overpriced for the quality. I think our bill came out to about $80. I'd say it felt like it was probably worth more like $50. having said that, the servers were nice and they were very fast with out food, but i feel like either the portions were to small of their prices were just too high.\n",
      "Humid. The edamame was served cold, when we asked for it to be warmed, it still came back cool. The rolls tasted ok, but they were rolled so loosely that they fell apart. I was really bummed to have such a bad experience. I will go back again to give them another chance.\n",
      "This place was recommended by New Tokyo ladies. We came here early Friday evening and the place was already packed. I felt that menu option was limited. No chirashi, No sushi dinner set. I really like Asari appetizer and OMG... sushi was really good. Come early and BYOB. Must try!\n",
      "Well we had a party of 6 so we waited about 20 mins for a table. We had just came from hiking so we got really thirsty from waiting and asked for water. They said we were about to be seated soon so we waited. we already knew what we wanted having waited so long so we quickly ordered. We got our water once our food came. We also got a few sushi rolls before appetizer and two people who ordered bento boxes had to wait longer. So we all waited and started digging in. I have never had sushi roll that fall apart. The volcano roll also was lack of fish and I've never seen that. We had to ask to return one roll because it was just falling apart and we couldn't eat it. The salmon roll and Vegas roll were really good. Just the volcano was falling apart. The Gyoza was also delicious. We tried the pork and vegetable. So this can be hit or miss but I know I don't recommend it if you looking for some sushi in Arizona!!!\n",
      "If I had to choose one word about Hana it would be (drum roll please....) inconsistent. I keep going back, so that's got to say something (however, there aren't many other options in Central Phoenix, so that doesn't hold a TON of weight, per se) I've been going here off and since they opened, and the food is pretty good. Service can be a bit off, I've even had rude service a time or two. On the flip side, I have also had some pretty good experiences (all though I almost always get takeout, ain't really diggin the BYOB thing. It was cute at the beginning, but after two years? really?). My wife and I generally get the baked mussels, which are decent. I tried the Yakibuta today (slow roasted pork) which I really liked. The rolls are average, nothing to write home about (by home, I mean Seattle so I guess I could be a bit bias) Overall this place is pretty good for the area, but it is a bit on the high-price side. If there were more options in the local area, no doubt they'd have to lower their prices a bit. Based on an article I read in New Times, there's going to be a Stingray Sushi opening up in Biltmore some time this year, so that may give Hana a run for it's money. My final verdict, meh.....\n",
      "Best sushi in town! Always high quality sushi...service is great...many unique specials. The BYOB policy sets this place apart from rivals like my other favorite sushi joint, Yasu.\n",
      "I visited a couple times two years ago and wasn't that impressed, and decided to give it one more shot a few weeks ago. I had a great experience, and visited again tonight. Yay! I'm a fan. I tend not to order rolls with crazy sauces, or anything with krab. What I did have was knock-your-socks-off fresh and delicious. Yellowtail sashimi, Mackeral sashimi, and not the marinated to death kind, either, scallop, raw shrimp (with the heads deep fried), salmon. All were super fresh and delicious. On my previous visit, the hamachi kama and uni were both pretty amazing. It's not the least expensive place for sushi in town, but the quality of the fish was very impressive. Arigato!\n",
      "This place is wonderful. BYOB and no associated fees. the sushi comes out on a fun boat. The ambiance was great and felt very authentic. It is family run and the sushi is awesome. So far takes the cake for the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. Will definitely go there again\n",
      "I went there Saturday night and I have read the reviews and knew there would be a wait to be seated. They told us it would be a 30-40 minutes for a table. We opted to eat outside to avoid the wait. It took 50 minutes for our food. My date was annoyed with how long it took and it made me wonder why it took so long. It is a small place. It was worth the wait though. We ordered stripped sea bass and that was so delicious. I love the place and would definitely go back. Maybe next time I'll eat inside and bring a bottle of wine. I heard about the BYOB but I didn't bring any. FYI if you do BYOB you cannot sit outside\n",
      "This is the best sushi in town period. It doesnt get fresher than Hana's especially in the desert. The sushi is very creative and they have some dishes you won't get here in Phoenix everyday.\n",
      "Great sushi. Very casual dining. Service could have improved. Felt rushed by my server and she would not give me eye contact. Other than that, sushi was great.\n",
      "Stopped in the other night to grab some sushi after a seeing a movie. The place is small, but has a good friendly vibe. The food - There were 4 of us and we decided to share. We had 3 rolls - spicy tuna (very good), hana roll (very good), and shrimp tempura roll (very good). We added some nigiri to that as well - tuna, snapper, yellow tail. All pretty standard items. Overall, the food was very good. The fish was fresh and the portion sizes were good as well. Why, one might ask, do I only give Hana 3 stars? Well, the bill came and after tip it was $160. Four people with no booze. Just seems like better value can be found at some other places. One man, two cents.\n",
      "Well I have to say for being a small place in central Phoenix this has some of the best sushi in the city. Hana is owned by the same guy who used to have the place in the Biltmore called Ayako. You get great customer service and really great quality sushi. The prices are as generous as the portions. It is a really low key, unpretentious place right across the street from channel 3 on 7th ave and Missouri. I love going here for lunch and dinner...even though it's out of my way. If you are looking for a new place for sushi that doesn't have that \"chain\" feel to it this is your place. Make a trip to Hana.\n",
      "Now this is a sushi place!! Authentic, small yet delightful! You will not be disappointed with the fresh fish selections they use! I love this place!! Thank you Hana! One of the best in Phoenix!! No liquor license and so far do not charge a corking fee.\n",
      "The best sushi! Variety is awesome! Friendly! BYOB tho!!theres a French bakery that sells Sake and whatever else you may want with your sushi across the street!! Great fresh and oh so yummy!!\n",
      "My daughter and I have been long time customers of Hana and tonight is the last night we will be dining at this establishment. We ordered 4 different items (tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll and yasai yakisoba). Upon opening the tuna roll, I noticed that they looked very odd - much different than they normally look - the tuna was bloody and the juices were in the take out container. It was unappetizing and frankly disgusting. My daughter eats tuna rolls frequently and she ate 1 and refused to eat the rest saying they didn't taste good. My spicy tuna was bland, there was no very much spice to it at all and I am used to Hana's spicy tuna making my nose run. The shrimp tempura had no flavor once so ever - extremely bland. The yasai yakisoba was of someone else so I do not know how it was except that normally the box is full and the box wasn't even half full tonight. It is a pity that our dinners were so blah and uninspiring. We will no longer be patrons of this establishment.\n",
      "Limited menu, high prices... tasty but not filling. I probably won't go back, but that shouldn't stop you from at least trying it.\n",
      "Hana never fails us. The service is excellent and the sushi is fresh and melts like butter every time. One of the main reasons we continue to be patrons of Hana is the fact that they most always have Uni on the menu. Alert: BYOB. Stop by at the AJ's on Camelback and Central for some sake to go with your meal. Hana provides a chiller for your cold sakes.\n",
      "I've eaten A LOT of sushi. However, Hana continues to be my favorite place to go! My boyfriend and I have tried nearly every sushi dish they have to offer and we have always been impressed. We go almost once a month and every time we go, we experience the same things: great food, great service, and a great atmosphere. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about everything on their menu and always more than willing to take the time to explain their new items. Also, it's BYOB - which is great! You can bring whatever alcoholic beverage you like and they will provide you with chilled glasses and even keep your drinks in the fridge if you'd like (they will also provide you with a little container to chill your wine in)! It can be a little pricier than some other sushi places, but you have to keep two things in mind: 1) it's in Arizona, it's a desert; and 2) good quality fish (like theirs) probably is not cheap. If anyone ever asks me for a sushi recommendation, I tell them to go to Hana! Dare I say, best Sushi in Arizona!\n",
      "I've heard a lot of hype for Hana over the years, and now after finally checking it out myself, I know why! I had a girls dinner planned for a Thursday night with two friends, and as usual, we started throwing around ideas about where to meet a day or two before. One friend wanted Italian, and another said sushi sounded good. I'm always game for sushi, so I suggested we try Hana. After all, I had bookmarked it on Yelp years ago, but for some reason, I still had not been. I was the first to arrive at around 7:20, and the place was packed with a few people waiting to be seated. I checked in with Jake, who was super friendly and he said it would be about a 15 minute wait. He was spot on. There was confusion with on of my girlfriends about the location -- (likely my fault) -- she was heading toward the Hana Sushi up north on Union Hills and 7th Ave when I reached her to clarify. (No relation between those restaurants by the way). Once that was cleared up, our party of three was seated in a timely manner and greeted warmly by Hannah, our adorable server. Not only did she know her stuff, giving us detailed answers to our questions about many of the items on the menu, but she was friendly and made sure to find out if we had any allergies, etc... Service overall couldn't have been more attentive! We ordered a variety of appetizers including seaweed salad, miso eggplant, and vegetable dumplings. We also had the special Toro Sashimi for the table (which was incredible by the way), and a handful of rolls and nigiri. Some of my faves were the Hana Pecha Roll, the Hotate and Ikura nigiri, and the Tuna Tataki roll. I didn't have a bad bite that evening. Everything was fresh, tasty, and no doubt high quality. The homemade wasabi is pretty remarkable as well, adding just the right kick and flavor to each bite. I'm not sure why it took so long for me to get to this local gem, but now that I've been, I plan on returning again and again. There are plenty of other options on the menu that I am already thinking about ordering next time, and I'll be sure to BMOB on future visits too! Looking forward to it already!\n",
      "This place is a bit pricy with no all you can eat sushi. Worst part is the fish isn't really much better then the places that have all you can eat while being nearly double for 2 pieces. Food was ok but nothing special like most of the reviews indicated.\n",
      "I wanted to bring my mother here for her birthday on the 4th of July. I called a few days ahead of time to make sure they would be open for the holiday and was assured they would be, and that a reservation wouldn't be necessary (or allowed). On the fourth i went shopping for a nice bottle of wine to bring, picked up my parents, and we made the 30 minute drive to Hana (we don't live close) to find Hana closed. I guess whoever answered the phone couldn't be bothered to check. we scrambled to find a place that would actually be open on the fourth (although they wouldn't allow us to bring in the nice bottle of wine i took the time to pick out). thanks for making her birthday great, hana! none of us will never be back, nor will i ever again recommend to anyone else.\n",
      "Best sushi in AZ. For real. Only downside is I stink like tempura when I leave. Really poor ventilation.\n",
      "Easily one of the worst sushi I've had. I had out of town visitors and we decided to try a closer restaurant than my usual places. Spicy tuna rolls were tiny (hardly any tuna) and a very small serving size. The Hana roll with several fish types war apples in cucumber fell apart when we tried to pick up by hand or with chopsticks. Fish was room temperature and slimy. The rainbow roll was decent, but the room temperature fish really bothered me. The best food was cooked, but still below average (goyza, tempura, edamame). Another party of 3 and our group of 3 waited 15 minutes to be seated even though hey had two larger open tables that seat 5. Their rationale: Maybe a smaller table could free up? We arrived around 7:45pm and finally got seated around 8pm. Totally unnecessary! Service was also dicey. Next time, I will drive the extra distance to go to one of my regular spots.\n",
      "just came back from having dinner here. first time visiting phoenix, and my family was looking for a nearby sushi place near our hotel. we're originally from vancouver, canada, where we have some of the best sushi/sashimi in north america. one of the items we ordered was the toro sashimi (6 pieces an order) which did not have a listed price. the other prices on the sashimi menu were average, with the most expensive being $20. when we got the bill, the 6 pieces of toro came out to be $40 before tax. this is at an average sushi restaurant, with most of the menu items costing $10-$20. i would understand if i had to pay this much at a fine dining sushi restauarant or at a place with a $$$ or $$$$ rating.. but seriously? i don't mind paying the extra money for something i know that's going to be worth it. felt like being robbed. i've had the freshest toro for less than half the cost. if you're going to put something on the menu that's skyrocketing high compared to the other items under the same category, maybe you should tell your servers to explain it to the customers. in the manager's defense, he said they fly fresh bluefin tuna from japan overnight and that it costs him 1000s of dollars. if you're spending that much money on your fish and you say your toro meat is that special, why aren't you advertising that to your customers? instead, you decide to keep the price off the menu and keep your servers quiet. totally unreasonable. edit after looking at their website: \" Doesn't all Sushi Grade Fish Come from Japan? The short answer is no. We buy fish based on taste and freshness, and based on feedback from our customers, we've been buying a lot of fish from Hawaii when available. The only fish we've sourced from Japan in the recent past is yellowtail, toro, tuna and mackeral. As soon as the Japan earthquake struck, we immediately made a big purchase of these fish, which were fished and flash frozen before the earthquake. We have not purchased any fish from the Japan region since that time, and all remaining stock in the restaurant of those fish is either sourced from other locations, or was fished and flash frozen before the earthquake, meaning there is absolutely no risk at all of radiation.\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME fukushima accident was in 2011 so what are you saying you're selling frozen tuna from 2011 or are you lying to everyone's face or you haven't updated your website for years my god\n",
      "Sushi is very good and very fresh. Only complaint is how loud it is. Small place. So gets noisy. Other than that l, it is great! Definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Food, though fresh was was basically one note. End of the meal was spoiled when while finishing our wine, when we were told that they were not set up for people to hang out and chat after their meal, and they had people waiting for our table. Won't be going back!\n",
      "If you really know sushi, you will appreciate the unbelievable quality of the fish and the skill of preparation at Hana. The fish is amazingly fresh and the cuts of sashimi are quite generous. The fresh water salmon is unique, and toro always melts in your mouth like butter. Rather than order directly from the menu, ask Sushi Chef Koji what he would recommend and then cut him loose. I've done this several times and have never - and I mean never - have been disappointed. And while others have commented that this is not bargain basement sushi, they are absolutely right. But if real sushi is your thing, the price is right on par. You'll get what you pay for and come away with a great sushi experience.\n",
      "I arrived hoping for seaweed salad but this was not on the menu so I ended up ordering a bento for lunch. It was fantastic. Particularly outstanding was the tempura. So light and crisp. The service was friendly and quick. I hope to eat here again.\n",
      "Went on a date here last night and we had the best service. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Food came out quickly. The Sashimi was fresh and the rolls were delicious.\n",
      "Pretty darn good. Tiny little place. Really tiny. The party of 14 waiting in front of me was surprised by the length of their wait time and left, but I mean what did they expect? In order to accommodate a party of 14 the place would have to pretty much clear out entirely. During dinner rush on a Saturday that might take a second. So, walking in and seeing they size, I imagined I too would have a bit of a wait. I put my name down but the hostess had no idea how long the wait would be, she simply told me there were \"a lot of parties ahead of you\". So, that was helpful. In any case we were there and wanted sushi, so we were in. It gave the fellas of my party time to run to the store to buy some wine as the joint is BYOB. I actually thought that was pretty cool, I like it. We ended up waiting about an hour. When we were seated our server was a little short with us. She was busy. So far this sounds like a 2 star review, amirite? But then we ordered. First off, I really like that they offer so many non-sushi dishes. My husband ALWAYS wants sushi, and sometimes I'm just not diggin' it, Hana's got me covered. The Yasai Yakisoba was really good, the noodles had a nice gingery bite, the whole table enjoyed bites. I've got my eye on the ramen for next time. We ordered a variety of sushi. It all came in a wooden boat, a member of our party sang a bit of Andy Samberg's 'on a boat'' there were laughs, thanks wine. There was a sugar cube on fire too, boy's love stuff on fire so half the table was really impressed. Every thing tasted fresh, and these are not the dime sized rolls that places like Sushi Brokers tries to pass off as sushi. The only thing we weren't super impressed with was the baked scallop special, it tasted like sweet baby ray's bar-b-q sauce... not great. So basically service needs work, sushi is good, fresh, and a fair size, and the noodles are bomb.\n",
      "It's more like fusion than jap food. We had the ramen, yakisoba and Vegas roll (salmon). The ramen tastes like instant noodles. Yakisoba was alright. The Vegas roll will be better if they give more salmon, too stingy on the fish. Wanted to get sashimi initially but the sashimi is $10 for 6 pieces. Too expensive if you ask me. The rating given is an average from all 3 of us.\n",
      "I am ecstatic to have discovered such a gem in the neighborhood!!! I'm just sad it took me this long to eat at Hana! My husband and I went on Saturday night and had the best time. We waited a bit for a table...probably around 25-30 mins, but once we were seated, the service was quick. Our food came out fast and our server was friendly. We ordered a tuna tataki roll and a spicy tuna roll...they both melted in our mouths. The tuna was so fresh and I am salivating now as I write this review. Also we ordered the gyoza which was good, but standard. My husband partook in a ramen noodle bowl and he loved it. The bowl was HUGE though. Order with caution...must be hungry or plan on sharing. We will be back VERY soon and I cannot wait. It's so rare to find a solid sushi spot in PHX, but now we have our \"go-to\"...YAY. BONUS: It's BYOB!\n",
      "Have brought a few people here as I love their sushi. I don't go as much as I want because I know there is going to be a wait for one of the 6 tables that they have inside this tiny place unless you get there by 430pm for dinner. I sat outside once but it was freezing but much better to have a conversation since it's so loud inside. Love the way they present the food because that is part of the dining experience right? Plates comes out with flames all over them. Never had a bad sushi buuuuuuuutttt one waitress on a visit asked me if I wanted the special, which was off the menu. She proceeded to write it out on paper as to be discreet. The special was whale. I looked at her like \"You obviously do not know about the Australian Sea Shepherds!\" So much for claims of scientific whaling and no, I didn't get the special off-menu item.\n",
      "I was really excited to try this new sushi place due to the high review and was dissapointed with my first experience. Customer service was good and fast. We were seated right away. However, I was not impressed with the food. For appetizers, we order edamame and some pork slices (forgot the name). Portion for the edamame was really small and just lightly salted. It was also very cold, as if it just came from the freezer. We then order two rolls, spider and rainbow rolls. They dont' really have a good selection of rolls for you to choose from. Each roll is about $15. Again, very very dissapointed with the small portion. I think we only get 5 pieces a roll for the $15 price. Also, the 2nd roll didn't even come with wasabi and gingers. The taste was nothing exceptional to justify the price and portion. We left the place with a $50 bills and still hungry. I hate to say that I don't think I will return again\n",
      "Amazing food with a quaint BYOB atmosphere. By far the freshest sushi I've had in Phx! And, not everyday do you see the owner out and talking to everyone, greeting her customers. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. No liquor licence, but they also don't charge a corking fee which is great. The rolls are average, but their sashimi is excellent. The yellow tail, toro, golden thai, and the holomokosomethingorother were so good and fresh that it basically melted in the mouth. The pickled wasabi root that came with the Yellowtail was also quite excellent. Apparently they get their fish in on Thursday, so if you want it fresh, Thursday is the day to go. That's when I went and I gotta say Wow! So good. The bill wasn't exactly cheap, but it isn't every day that you get that fresh of fish in Phoenix that meets that quality. A+ I will definitely be back (on a Thursday)\n",
      "GO, RIGHT NOW, GO! I have been to many sushi places across the country and this is BY FAR my favorite sushi restaurant ever. I always crave their volcano roll (basically every day). On a normal visit, we order edamame (warmed) to start, then order 4-5 rolls and 8-10 sashimi pieces. The fish is so fresh and tasty, you would think they caught the fish out back seconds before plating it for you. The salmon is my favorite sashimi, but my sister in law would say her favorite is the uni. It is also BYOB, so feel free to bring some beer, bottle of wine, or even champagne. They will keep it all on ice for you and make sure you are always filled up. Can't get much better, especially with sushi being so expensive. I hear their noodle dishes are AMAZING too, but I can't stray away from the sushi - it's that good! You will not regret it.... GO!\n",
      "Holy Rusty Metal Batman! I actually had killer service here. I heart Hana with all of my being, but we all know the service can be *ahem* choppy. But two Saturdays ago on a super stormy night we had super smooth service. They didn't give my beers to someone else, yeah! And the loads of sushi, tempura and ramen we had was magical, as usual. Hana, I smell 5 stars coming your way...\n",
      "Great quality sushi here at a great price. I've had lunch here once with a bento box which makes you full, full, full. All other times I called in and got take-out sushi. They will tell you 15 minutes for pick up, but it's more like 25. Once they forgot wasabi and soy sauce and chop sticks in my take-out bag. Other than that this is the best sushi in central phoenix.\n",
      "I grew up in washington where the fish couldn't get any fresher.. So I thought! Hana sushi is better than anything I have ever tried before! My family or boyfriend cones with and we will always get 5 star service. Regular meal: Poki chips Miso soup + rice Volcano roll Vegas roll Dragon roll Some sort of delicious chicken! All sorts of their fresh sashimi Thy know exactly what we want when we arrive and start making it for us when we sit down. That's the kind of relationship we like to build! It's nice to sit down an have people recognize your face. Plus it is bring your own beer! Totally worth it, try it and you'll love it!\n",
      "AMAZING food, BEAUTIFUL presentation, and WONDERFUL service. When I unwrapped my straw and chopsticks, the paper didn't sit on the table for more than a minute before some came to pick it up and throw it away. The server was very attentive, my drink was never empty. A great experience overall! I will definitely be back!\n",
      "I love this place. The food is delicious ,the service is great. Yes its a bit pricey like most good Japanese restaurants but Im willing to pay for great food. Ive been many times. Dinner is better than lunchtime. I went on my Birthday and the server overheard my conversation and they gave me a free tempura ice-cream desert with a candle.. Totally unexpected. They are incredibly friendly and accommodating. Ive lived in Seattle and San Francisco, Ive traveled to Japan. Hana is as close as you can get to really good Japanese food in Arizona.\n",
      "My boyfriend and I dined at Hana tonight, and despite the numerous four and five star reviews, I was not too impressed. I found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places, and the food to be of only moderate quality. I did appreciate the authentic atmosphere, it was perfect for our date night. However, my boyfriend and I found ourselves a little creeped out by our server who paced the small restaurant while we decided what we would order, and lingered near the table just a little bit too long every time he checked on us. All in all, the food was decent, but overpriced, I will be sticking to Moto on 16th street and Glendale.\n",
      "Gluten free eaters, beware, these guys aren't selling to those with true allergies or intolerances. I had lunch there today and got so sick afterward. The waiter mentioned some things on the menu are marked GF but have such a small amount of gluten in them, they label them GF anyway. NOT ok for Celiacs or sensitive groups whose digestive system will be permanently damaged by even trace amounts. Appreciate the options but wish they understood food allergies better. In a restaurant, it's one of the things that should be taken most seriously.\n",
      "BYOB. That alone will get any establishment 3 stars in my book, but luckily Hana had more to offer. Their fish selection is unbeatable. Where else will you find striped bass and uni nigiri? No where. Trust me, I've looked. In addition to the quality fish they serve, I appreciate their attention to detail (see flaming sugar cube on the corner of your plate of sushi). Great service, great food, I will definitely be back. Word of advice, stick to the fish dishes, the noodles are a bit of a let down.\n",
      "Very good! The spicy tuna was real - not chip-chop ham looking mayo mixture, but actual spicy raw small chunks. Hana Pride roll was fabulous, all the sashimi tasted fresh. I only gave four stars because some of the rolls were unavailable due to not having the seafood in (?), yet posted as available for the day. I will be back with friends.\n",
      "I have never seen so many unique items on a Japanese menu before. This place goes way beyond your typical California roll, although they have those too. I had the opportunity to try hamachi collar, which was delightful. This place is BYOB, so be sure to bring something to drink if you want it. Hana has all the glassware. Bottom line - go here hungry, ask questions if you need to know what something is, and try at least one new thing. This is the place to do it!\n",
      "You don't need to fly to Japan for unbelievable sushi, just drop into Hana's. Koji is amazing and shared some unreal ahi with our table tonight. This is definitely the best sushi spot in Phoenix and I am amazed with some of the 4 star reviews. Really? No disrespect Nobu, but Koji is the man here. An absolute must stop when I am back in Phoenix to see my family. The Hana roll and poki chips are definitely favorites. Tonight we all had the Shake salmon dinner and I had the Maguro. Don't worry about the Phoenix location, you would not get a table if Hana was in Scottsdale....their loss and your gain! Thanks Koji, Lori and Lynn\n",
      "Went on lunch break during the week, got the Volcano Roll and the Ramen. It was GOOD!! I will be returning.\n",
      "Very high-quality, fresh ingredients are used to create every dish. The tuna tataki is the star of the show here and should not missed... I think it is best by far! I would suggest steering clear of the Lil Dyno... It's weird combination of textures and flavors and served hot on a piece of foil. Just not my cup of tea. In my opinion, the atmosphere is a little more casual than their prices would suggest. That said, the environment is cozy and intimate... Perfect for a date night (or if you are flying solo there are plenty of seats at the sushi bar). TIP: Be sure to ask for the fresh wasabi - amazing! This is my first time ever finding this anywhere and it had set a new bar in the Japanese dining experience.\n",
      "I like Hana, and the service here is pretty great. I definitely think the quality of ingredients is up there, but I don't think the consistently higher price points justify the lackluster presentation and small portions. Located in its own small plaza, Hana sports sparse tables in a dimly lit interior. Perhaps the dimness is for an intimate ambiance, perhaps it's to keep the inside cool, but it bordered on being difficult to see. Service was attentive and considerate, to the point where our initial host asked if there were any food allergies and our waitress seemed psychic in anticipating tea and soda drink refills. $15 Rainbow Roll: I rarely mention pricing, but it seems that most of the rolls here are $15 or above. That would be fine if the presentation, portion, and quality all justified it, but I think this roll only did one out of the three. The fish was indeed fresh, but the roll seemed almost sloppily made, with one end obviously devoid of fish. The rolling was also not done well, and the roll fell apart quite easily while picking up. $15 for Spider Roll: I honestly don't think I've ever seen a Spider Roll priced at $15 unless it included other fish or expensive ingredients. I expected this to be larger than the standard six-piece soft shell crab roll, but it wasn't. Again the ingredients were good, and the soft shell crab was freshly fried with a nice light batter. But again the roll fell apart easily, and the pickled carrot inside was clumsily cut and took up too much space within the already-sparse roll. Uni and ankimo nigiri: I was so excited that there was uni and ankimo nigiri that night, and of course I had to try both. The uni was fresh and ankimo creamy, but the sushi rice had so much rice vinegar that I had a hard time tasting the delicate flavors of uni and ankimo. After the initial bite where I ate the nigiri in one piece, I took the uni and ankimo off to eat sashimi-style so that the rice wouldn't overwhelm them. Perhaps it's the norm in Arizona (I haven't tried enough places here to tell yet), but the ankimo was also twice as expensive as I'm used to. $3 for hot tea and $2.50 for soda (free refills). Not a big deal, but it also seems that most sushi places here don't offer complimentary hot tea. Just a tidbit if you're used to it like I initially was. I'm conflicted about Hana; I may come back for the fresh ingredients, but part of me thinks that the price point and other factors don't justify the product.\n",
      "This is for the I don't like raw fish sushi eater. Their \"sushi\" menu is diverse but they charged me $32 for 3 tekka maki rolls. They were good but $32 for 18 SMALL pieces of tuna roll is not my idea of a good sushi restaurant. My son ordered seared ahi tuna meal and they would only serve it medium! WHAT??!?!?? You serve raw tuna here! What idiot thinks you should ruin ahi like that? Then it arrives a disgusting shade of gray all the way through three of the five pieces. So they overcooked the tuna they were planning to overcook. Well done ahi tastes a LOT like canned tuna. I'm never going back. Much better choices elsewhere in the valley. Oh yeah our bill was $140 for two. Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!\n",
      "Chef Lori never ceases to amaze me. Service is exceptional Hannah from Hana rocks it.\n",
      "Hands down-the BEST sushi in metro phoenix area! Service is wonderful-they treat you like family. Sushi is awesome every single time! Try the Poke Chips!\n",
      "I love their food and have eaten here many times, but last night my husband and I took my mother to dinner here. We brought a bottle of wine because it is BYOB and ordered a ton of food (and spent a lot of money). As soon as we had eaten 90% of our food they came and brought the bill. Then they reminded my husband to give them his card. This is while we are still talking and drinking our wine and finishing our dinner. Then they brought the bill back completed and started clearing plates while we talked. Finally a few minutes later a man walked up (while, again, we still hadn't finished our wine) and told us we had to get up and leave because it was a small restaurant and other people were waiting for our table. There was only one party waiting for a table, but clearly it was more important to them that we leave since we had already paid and they weren't going to get any more money.\n",
      "My first time here, I hate their parking.. was so hard to find a spot. However, the staffs were friendly. The food was good, and quick. The place is not for kids, I saw all adults, and it was loud. Overall I like the food but not the environment.\n",
      "It was Friday night and was out with my son, his fiancé and his mom for Moms and Sons date night, and we picked Hana as the place to go. We arrived about 10 minutes before opening, honestly we were not even paying attention to time just chatting it up and were like oh it's not opened yet, and so we just waited. Hana opened and we were given a choice of where we wanted to sit, at this time they were maybe 3 other parties with us, when we sat down we were handed a menu, and after 5 minutes the server came by and asked if we were ready to order, we said no not yet, then after another 2 the server came back and asked are you ready yet, at this time, we quickly ordered some rolls and drinks, and said we need a few more minutes, drinks were quickly made and then server was back again asking for our order, this time we just quickly figured out what we wanted. The rolls came out, some California rolls, Spicy Tuna Roll, Vegas Roll, all the rolls were good, the spicy tuna was my favorite! For my meal I went with the Miso Ramen, it came with ramen noodles, charred pork, green onion & seaweed and I added a dashi soft boiled egg to it. The broth had great flavor, the pork and veggies were delsih, the soft boiled egg was a little over cooked to be a soft egg, it just didn't have the thick runny yoke that adds creamy texture to the broth, but overall this is a great bowl of ramen for 15 bucks. Just mere seconds after I put my spoon down our server came to the table to ask if I was done, and I said yes, and my bowl was quickly taken away. Our entire time at Hana was apx 35 minutes if that, it felt completely rushed, granted it was a Friday night, but there was no line and no one waiting to be seated, and not even 1/2 the restaurant full, but clearly they only wanted us there to eat and leave, no side talking and they did show frustration with us when we did not have our orders ready to be taken. Being rushed ruined the entire dining experience, sometimes you just feel unwanted and this was one of those situations. I have been to Hana before, and have enjoyed it and have many friends that enjoy it too, but because of the rushed service, when it wasn't even busy has left a bitter memory with me and my return factor is pretty low.\n",
      "Very good and fresh. They did have more variety of sushi rolls but I was there for lunch so not sure if dinner has more options.\n",
      "Service was wonderful! and the sushi was outstanding.. a great little spot to grab an authentic Japanese bite.\n",
      "Definitely some of the best Japanese dishes in Phoenix. The sushi is really great here, but venture out and try some of their other dishes. The tempura and nabe are delicious as well!\n",
      "Two persons. No alcohol. No dessert or appetizers. Four rolls = $71.00 I don't think I would rate this a $$! Great service. Amazing atmosphere. Exceptionally fresh fish but just a bit higher priced than most. We saw two couples bring in their own beer and wine at the sushi bar. The server put the customer's 12 pack of Shocktop in their mini fridge. That is pretty cool in my book. If ever in downtown Phoenix looking for a great but pricy sushi place, this is your stop!\n",
      "The best thing about Hana is that it is in my neighborhood. The worst thing about Hana was that I didn't enjoy the experience and I wanted to! The waiting staff was milling about the door area, ignoring people. I dislike when staff has people to greet but they are busy chatting about their social calendars or whatnot with their backs to the customers. However the chef's behind the counter greeted us very happily. The energy was such that I began thinking, \"Hey, this is exactly what I was looking for! Hooray!\" After we were seated other people came in and got like a group greeting. Maybe they are regulars. It would be annoying to group greet every single customer. There were two waitstaff running about like crazy chickens doing all the work. I was sort of curious about that, what was the point of having so many people \"on\" that weren't actively working the tables? We got one of the rushed servers and she spoke so fast we had trouble understanding her. We let her know we were new and would need some time to acclimate to the selections, but we didn't get a break about becoming familiar with what was offered and ended ordering hurriedly. As a result we didn't end up trying as many things as we might have. It's not good to rush people who are planning to explore a menu. I mean we can really spend some serious money on sushi if given half a chance. Despite the fast ordering, it was slow in being made. The chef seemed busy making boats, so I was ok with waiting... for awhile. Then I just got rumbly and flagged down the server who was at that time actually bringing out my Endamame. Maybe I was impatient? The Endamame wasn't salted and they were cool. Not sure if that's the style for here, but I prefer hot and salted shells that pop open with light pressure. Not these. However it was a good thing I had them, because my wait continued and it would have been intolerable if it hadn't been for the pods. I was determined to be impressed with the fresh fish I read about and was hoping that we'd found a place close to home for happy sushi time. The octopus was not fresh. It was dry and very rubbery. The other fish was decent but there was too much of a fish smell, another warning to me. The rice didn't hold either. Sloppy or collapsing sushi rolls always annoy me and then if I determine the fish isn't the best, I'm pretty much done. It was ok, but I truly expected it to wow me. I think we came at a bad time. It was dinner, but they weren't packed to the gills. The chef really wanted us to be happy it seemed, he did continually smile and nod our way. My partner did not let me see the bill. Apparently for what we ordered it was much higher than I would have liked. They always do that if they think I am going to feel upset about the cost/value ratio. We paid, we left, it's not going on our regular rotation. We might try it again, because there are an awful lot of good reviews here and it is really close to home, but so far when I've brought it up my partner I hear, \"I don't think so\" and \"you have a really poor memory don't you?\" I do my best to recall the happy sushi chef and think... maybe if I came on a good night he would make stronger sushi rolls and the fish would be just delivered and maybe my whole experience would be speical and I'd be thrilled to have Hana right nearby. As it is Hana gets Two stars= Meh. I've experienced better.\n",
      "Hana is possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I love the small, intimate atmosphere, the quality of the food (I mostly eat sushi and sashimi), the authentic feel and the fact that it is BYOB (LOVE that). The staff is always warm and friendly, and they hustle to satisfy their customers!\n",
      "We were lucky to find this fantastic spot within days of relocating back to Phoenix. This fish is always top-notch, as is the service and the presentation. Seasonal variety is great, too. The lunchtime bento selection is second to none. The menu is great but always (ALWAYS!) ask about items on the board. The octopus salad and asazuke are always great cool sides to beat the heat. And ask if they have the grilled squid as it is always done perfectly. If you are looking for fusion sushi, this is not your place. Solid, perfectly done Japan-style food and preparation is what you will find here. We come at least twice a month. Our favorite restaurant in Phoenix!\n",
      "Sushi was good but the other stuff we eat was not, over priced for what we had, nice service.\n",
      "This was certainly a different take on a Japanese Izakaiya/Ramen place. We enjoyed the ramen and the accompaniments, as well as the Katsu curry dish. We brought in some sake as this was BYOB as well, and certainly enjoyed our time there. The ambiance is lively and the service was fast and attentive. Good choice if one wants good Japanese at decent prices.\n",
      "20 mile drive, lackluster service and slightly overpriced menu (why is there 3 menus with each one more difficult to read). It looks like a one and out experience. The quality of the fish was better than other sushi restaurants in the valley, but you have to do a little more than have a burning flame on my plate.\n",
      "When I go to a sushi restaurant, I look to make sure they follow the rules below: 1- Must have fresh wasabi. The paste you mix with soy sauce to your desired level of brown is great and all, but real, fresh wasabi is much much better. It has a biting taste, and not something you want to dollop on your rolls. It opens your sinuses right up, but in an awesome way. Best thing about Hana? It was free, and it kept coming! 2 - Limited American roll selection. If you like your Las Vegas rolls, good for you. I however like my raw fish, and my simple sashimi, sushi, and rolls. Hana has a very purposeful menu that sticks to the good stuff. 3 - Decor. Hana is tiny. Probably seats 40 on a good day. Very clean and modern feel inside though. No obtrusive posters or ads, all food (dinner and sushi) are made right there behind the bar. Price was, Hana is a bit on the higher side, but you are paying for the quality and the service. Service was wonderful. I ended up getting the Miso Soup to start (delicious), squid salad, Alaska roll, and an oyster shooter (best part of my meal). This place is BYOB, so there is that. They also asked me about any allergies at the very beginning of the meal, which was kinda great (and would be even awesomer for someone who actually has any allergies), Overall, is this a place you go weekly? No, not unless you are made of money. However, special occasions, dates, celebrations with a small group of friends? For sure!\n",
      "Yay Hana! I really like sushi but it's hard to find a good place, living in the desert and all. Hana is so good. Their staff is helpful and the food so fresh and tasty. It's BYOB which is awesome as well! I wish there was a little more seating space, it's pretty small. It's a minor draw-back but something to be considered if planning on grabbing sushi with a group. Anyhow, all in all I like this place and will certainly go back.\n",
      "Hana is a great find on 7th Ave. It's not \"cool,\" but it's as sleek as strip malls come, and the service and sushi we're excellent. We noted that that the portions were especially large; I could barely finish the three rolls I ordered. The outside patio looked gross (in the parking lot), which was our only complaint. Byob worked great for us and kept the price of dinner down. I look forward to visiting Hana again.\n",
      "We have been coming to Hana since it has opened. This place has replaced our need to go to zen 32 for sushi because the service and the food us 10 times better. If you want fresh fish and great staff thus is the place to be. Lori the owner is always there when we come and she always makes sure to say hi even when she has a house full. We love the sushi especially the volcano roll and the spicy tuna. We also order the hamachi Kama (sp?) which is a cooked underbelly of tuna. Amazing! Try this place if you want great sushi!\n",
      "The 6 piece tuna maguro and spicy tuna roll was phenoms!\n",
      "I haven't had a lot of sushi in the valley. So if I'm being totally sushi-naive for Phoenix, go ahead and let me know... I was incredibly excited to find Hana and have it actually be good sushi and near my hood! Our server was the sweetest woman. We ordered a bunch of sushi and were totally bummed that we didn't read about them ahead of time to know that they are BYOB. But beyond lacking good wine to couple with the food, we had a great mix of the typical spicy tuna roll, hana roll (good...love tempura....even if it makes me slightly a sushi sell out), tamago nigiri, seaweed salad, and squid sashimi. All really really good. I was totally impressed. The only downside about this place was that we waited about 20 minutes after receiving our first wave? of food to receive our squid sashimi. I also heard the table next to us mention that they had been waiting 30 minutes for a california roll (wtf?) and they had already finished their entire meal. The table behind us had the same complaint. So, I could kind of get it for squid (I assume you have to cut that extra carefully!) but california rolls...last I checked that isn't sushi science. Overall, I was truly impressed. The only advice I would have is to send the entire order out at once...\n",
      "Came here after our Diamondbacks -Giants Game at the Chase Field. It was a Friday night, and this place was packed; so we had to wait a little bit which gave us time to study the menu. Then finally, we were seated at the bar; with a warm welcome from Lynn. Lynn was very welcoming and she took time answering my questions with the specialties on the board. Me? Lots of questions with Sushi??? I'm like a sushi goddess...but why? Well.... some of the Specials on the board were priced at $20/roll. Unless maybe it's topped with Toro.. (actually, with Toro and just Toro, it could be a little bit more) I've never seen a roll priced that much in the SF Bay Area. I was thinking maybe because fish in Arizona is expensive. Okay that could be it... Anyway... here's a breakdown of what we ate... *Poke Chips: Complimentary... Definitely a brush of flavor to get your tastebuds rolling.... *Uni Shooters: $5.00 each. My boyfriend who will never eat Uni Liked it. I loved it. If this gives a person a buzz, I'd get drunk with this every single day. The ponzu sauce brings, the green onion, the quail egg...and the uni... wow.. them all... is like seeing Unicorns in the sky..... *Hana Pride: $20.00.. This roll is so refreshing; and different and FRESH. The 2 rolls in the middle ensembles a stash of sashimi slices of 6 different kinds of fish, all held by this cucumber warp. The insight on making this roll was amazing. First time i've ever seen one. *Yellowtail Roll: One of their regularly priced roll... Good amount of yellowtail; artistically made... and Fresh hamachi. I like how the rice was even and there wasn't too much of it. *Spider Roll: I was surprised how big this roll was. Definitely a favorite. *Baked Salmon Roll: my boyfriend's favorite.... in the bay area, it's just like a Lion King... I loved the yellow sauce, the topping..and how perfectly it's baked. ***Lynn made us try fresh wasabi... AMAZING. never had that before. If you're in the Phoenix area... Hana should definitely make it to your list... We devoured everything we ordered......and Lynn was amazed. The couple next to us only had 2 rolls, with some leftover rolls. haha! Lynn, if you're reading this!!! Thank you so much for our amazing dinner!! we enjoyed your creations! ps: They don't serve beer. BUT what's even better... it's BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Hana is great! The service can be a bit scattered at times, but the food is consistently excellent AND they have gluten-free soy sauce available. Just ask. The chefs are also aware of gluten-free considerations and don't drown everything in soy sauce and crunchy stuff. I'd love to see a bigger, more varied menu! And maybe stop writing the specials on the whiteboard in orange marker - impossible to read. It's not pretentious or fancy schmancy but can totally be a fun date! BYOB!\n",
      "Amazing sushi! The best in town, by far. They're fish is about the freshest you can get in Phoenix. My new favorite sushi spot!\n",
      "Hana has us coming back for fresh fish (we order mostly sashimi). They have fantastic yellowtail sashimi. Always. Never not fresh. We love their uni shooters, the rainbow carpaccio is a must as well! This is a family operation and we love that, they are always friendly and remember repeat customers. They get really busy at times, but we think it's totally worth the wait. Also, Hana is BYOB, that's the icing on this cake!!! Their cooked food is amazing as well! They have authentic Japanese dishes and you can always ask for something that's not on the menu. If they could only open another location at Tatum and Shea ;-)\n",
      "I have visited Hana twice now and both times were excellent. Both times the service was excellent the girls that waited on us were fun and didn't mind that we wanted to sit and chat and we weren't in a rush to get back to work. The sushi rolls were interesting, they have the standard rolls that all sushi places have (tuna, yellow tail, california, etc.) but their signature rolls were crazy, for example, the Volcano Roll - california roll draped in white fish and a spicy mayo sauce baked to perfection What surprised me the most, I asked for gluten free soy sauce, not only did they have gluten free sauce but they had low sodium gluten free sauce! Their prices are the same as any sushi place in town. What sets them apart other than their great service and fun fish combos, its BYOB, I really need to remember that for next time and bring a bottle of wine.\n",
      "I had never had Peruvian food and was excited to try this place. At 11:45 on Tuesday, it was not too crowded. The service was quick and friendly. My friend had the Arroz Con Pollo (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & pan fried chicken) I had the Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian/Chinese Fusion Style chicken fried rice). Both dishes were great. Mine looked a bit like a standard fried rice but had a much bigger punch of flavor. The highlight of his dish was definitely that cilantro rice. SO GOOD. He ordered white meat and his bone-in breast was a bit dry. I am a dark meat gal, so would order that instead if I get it myself. I have to go back for the ceviche though. I saw a couple plates go by and wish I was not on a 1 hour work break. Those mountains of seafood need time to be savored. Man it looked good! Definitely will return.\n",
      "I'm pretty sure I won't be able to say enough good things about this restaurant. Jeez - everything from the delectable adult beverages, through the amazing appetizers, to the main courses - wow!!! Over the top delicious. It's another one of those places I don't want to get too crowded, but I don't want it to go away. Stay busy, but not too busy, you know? Head over there - you won't regret the Papa Rellena for starters, the Arroz con Pollo with its perfectly seasoned chicken and yellow rice (enough for 2, btw), or the Carapulcra - a heavenly potato stew with yucca that I still can't get out of my mind. Enjoy. I know you will.\n",
      "I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great. I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here.\n",
      "Really enjoyed our dinner here. We weren't sure what to expect, and as the cuisine was unfamiliar the help from our waiter was much appreciated! I really love when people take the time to explain the food their serving with knowledge and passion. The food was interesting and very tasty. Come here for a not too out there adventure and a departure from the regular burger and fries!\n",
      "Omg this is definitely a new favorite! I really didn't know what to expect. As soon as the doors opened the aroma was unbelievable. Everything looked delicious. I settled on the rice with sea food and it was wonderful!!!\n",
      "This food is INCREDIBLE!! We got a very generous sized appetizer of Yuka frita with two delicious sauces. I ordered chicken saltado per a recommendation from the server and was blown away. It was bursting with flavor...a wonderful combination of onions, tomatoes, potatoes, and chicken in a mouth-watering vinegar/pepper sauce. I couldn't get enough! The Arroz con Pollo was very large and full of flavor! We cannot wait to go back!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n",
      "Extraordinary food and service. Presentation is mouthwatering. Really fond of the appetizers and desserts.\n",
      "1st time. Absolutely fabulous. Great flavor in every bite. Friendly staff and Pisco! !!!\n",
      "Just like mamma makes! Thank you, Omar! We loved the food and the amazing service! We'll be back!!! The Lomo Saltado was just like home!\n",
      "I love Peruvian food! This place is a hidden gem on 7th street. Prices are fair so don't be shocked if you are looking for something cheap. This is not \"a five dollar footlong.\" The place is a family operation and the environment is great. They show south american soccer which is a plus especially during world cup qualifiers. Any soccer fans out there??? Nothing beats a good Pisco Sour or Ceviche. Karen is one of my favorite servers. She is direct and to the point and very Knowledgeable. Her brother in the kitchen is also very funny and friendly. I would definitely recommend making a visit. If your wondering what \"El Chullo\" means it is like a andean beanie which covers your ears and if you have ever been in Peru, Ecuador or Northern Chile you would definitely understand why its needed.\n",
      "By far the worst experience I had and we only entered for a second with two kids and three adults and were told they only take reservations of parties of four and more. The girl proceeded to tell us that it would be a 30min but more likely an hour wait when there were two tables of four opened. I pointed that out that we would squeeze into one of the four tops and she said they were reserved. It was very apparent that we were not welcomed. They also seemed under staffed. I wanted to bring my small family to taste the food since I had come to this place before and enjoyed their food. Needles to say we will never be coming back.\n",
      "The passion fruit juice was delicious, and the steak lomo saltado will be the best thing you have eaten in a long long time. The marinade on the plate is to die for...\n",
      "The food and service here was excellent. The portion sizes were very large. Everything was extremely flavorful. Dessert was wonderful too. The prices were reasonable. I can't wait until the bar opens there. We will definitely be back.\n",
      "It's been too long since I've had good Peruvian food! Thoroughly enjoyed both the mango and passion fruit Pisco to kick things off and then after a very long wait had Lomo Saltado which was flavorful but a tad salty and short on tomatoes. My husband had a delicious vinegar sauce chicken and we split the crab avocado starter....yum! The service was friendly. On the downside parking is a nightmare and it's in a seriously sketchy looking neighborhood next to a smoke shop/liquor.\n",
      "Tasty. Do not pass up an opportunity to dine here. Beef was tender and delicious. Fried egg cooked perfectly. Service is slower paced because it's a small restaurant. Plan accordingly...and keep in mind as you wait that it'll be so worth it.\n",
      "This place is definitely legit. Came here for our Early Valentines Dinner on Friday night. The owner and Chef and family are cool and nice. Chef Omar brings out your food to your table. I had a beef pasta (forget the actual peruvian name for it) but it was super tasty and so good. Also, the ceviche is just so much fun to eat and look at. Very tasty and colorful and flavorful. Only downside, my BF made reservations and when we got there one of the sisters at the front foor said we couldn't be seated because they had a big party at 8pm. However we had reservations...in which she had written our name down and finally we got sat.\n",
      "I don't know where to begin, so let me say this - El Chullo's food is TO DIE FOR. A Peruvian friend had told us about the place two years ago, but somehow we got around to trying it only last night. It's a small, homey, family-run restaurant. The people running the place and running around the place are genuinely friendly, as if they've invited you to be a part of their home, food and lives. We waited near the bar for about five minutes while our table of six was getting ready. I ordered a pisco sour which was amazing. Then there was the food. You know how a server walks past you with a plate of food that turns heads? That was happening with every single plate of food that came out of El Chullo's kitchen. Everything looked so delicious that it was hard to make up our minds about what to order. I am a vegetarian, so I was pleased to see a vegetarian section on their menu. Our group ordered appetizer platters, fries, tacu tacu (vegetarian and seafood versions), ceviche, deep fried sea food platter, frijoles con seco a nortena, and the veggie version of peruvian-chinese fried rice. OH. MY. GOD. We worked on the installments of food for about two hours. Everyone shared, laughed and loved every single bit of it. Of course, I had to stick to vegetarian food but let me tell you, it wasn't a compromise at all. In fact, my meat-eating husband loved the veg tacu tacu and fried rice so much that we are still fighting about who gets to eat the leftovers. The portion size of the entrees was BIG (I'm not sure what dish the guy, who says portions were small, ordered). Appetizers were just that, appetizers, so that you can save space for the delicious food. The food was spicy without being hot, not that we would have minded that. Pricing was reasonable and at par with other similar dining places. Parking is available in the back. But wait! I forgot to tell you about dessert. Of course there's the delicious Leche Asada and Crema Volteada, but the husband ordered Alfajores, which is a layer of caramel between two cookies. I think we died and went to heaven because tasting that thing was an out of body experience. It has been a while since our friend circle has come together and bonded over some delicious food. It has also been a while since we discovered a new cuisine. I now count Peruvian food and El Chullo among my favorites cuisines and restaurants.\n",
      "Authentic Peruvian food. The whole family (mom, dad and sons ) cook at the restaurant. Best dishes to order are lomo saltado and ceviche mixto. The potatoes with huancaina sauce and the yuca frita are amazing appetizers.\n",
      "Best Peruvian Food! I recommend everyone to stop by and try it out. Best sea food i have tasted for a long time.\n",
      "Literally, everything is delicious. Brought my Peruvian dad who often is not impressed, he likes it better than our regular spots back home. Appetizer combo, Lomo Saltado this time. Even the cocktails are delicious.\n",
      "Ohh yeah, so happy there's Peruvian in phx.. I like this and the Peruvian joint on alma school and ray road equally.. I could eat their lomo saltado every day.. the chicken with the red sauce is also awesome. Do yourself a flavor\n",
      "Really disappointed, I ordered the lomo saltado in beef and a casa rellena for takeout. When I got there the food was already bagged up and when paying I got charged over 30 dollars for 1 entree and a very small single sized appetizer. I went home and saw my food was soggy and looked very old like it had been sitting out for a while. I was pissed. I should've gone to red lobster at least you know what your getting for the price. I'd give this place a negative star if I could. And I love Peruvian food!!!!\n",
      "I'm a Peruvian girl and I always think my mom's Peruvian home cooked meals are actually the best. I came to El Chullo on Peruvian Independence Day (July 28th) with my dad in order to celebrate. I ordered the lomo saltado and he ordered the cau cau. As much as I love my mom, I hate to say that this lomo saltado is just as good (maybe even a bit better - please don't tell her). I told my hubby that I have to take him here so that he can try it out for himself. I even loved their rocoto (hot peppered sauce) and I dipped my french fries in them. It was spicy...but a good spice. I highly recommend this place if you want to try good Peruvian food!\n",
      "Amazing culinary roller coaster of international flavors and spices can be found here. I ate my heart out...El corazon (heart) was a lot better than I imagined. The ceviche was so good (and spicy) we ran out twice. The Peruvian national drink (Pisco) flowed like water. Omar was our server. He has a really cool tattoo of the Peruvian Nazca Lines (hummingbird). Go often. You'll thank me later.\n",
      "Food was delicious!!! Authentic!!! Restaurant seems to be worked by the family that owns it. The sons who basically does everything except cook, is very personable and has great people skills. His mother is sweet but does not speak English. If you go when it is busy be prepared to wait. What they need to do is designate each one in the family a duty. Son waits tables, mother gets waters and canchitas, father clears and sets tables and helps with bringing out food. Anyways if you have time it is definitely worth the wait. We will go back for sure!! Oh and the pisco sours are awesome!! Along with the anticuchos and aji de gallina. Yum\n",
      "Delicious one of a kind dishes here!! I had the ceviche and I ordered it medium on the spicyness....OMG taste buds went crazy!! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!! The traditional Peruvian drinks are refreshing and tasty!!\n",
      "Pretty much everything here is good. Tacu tacu seafood is delightful. My favorite though is the lomo saltado.\n",
      "Excellent food and service. Large portions that were delicious. Staff was friendly and informative. Omar is the chef and he took time to explain the different dishes. This is my new favorite spot!\n",
      "Service was nice, but as a Peruvian I tried there lomo saltaldo and I was very disappointed. Too many fries, everything was soggy and the rice was pretty bad too\n",
      "Ell Chullo is a hidden little gem in central Phoenix with fabulous Peruvian food and drinks that shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves south american food. It is a family run restaurant that takes their cooking seriously with great service and a fun atmosphere. Don't miss the Pisco Sours, Lomo Saltado or awesome ceviche. Save room for dessert because they have some amazing homemade creations and don't forget to order the outstanding hot chocolate made with special chocolate from Peru. My only complaint is that their parking is not ideal.\n",
      "Food was excellent and seasoning was great. Portions were large so we would consider splitting a meal in the future. Yucca appetizer was very good. Small kitchen so will take a bit of time to get your meals. Seats about 25 so plan accordingly.\n",
      "Okay, so I went here on a whim with a co-worker and I'm so happy we randomly picked this spot. Both of us were new to Peruvian food so we had a ton of questions for our waitress. She was very patient with us and answered all of our silly questions and gave us both great recommendations! Both dishes (fish Ceviche and the TACU TACU CON LOMO AL JUGO) were both super flavorful! I ordered the ceviche, mainly because I was a little scared of trying anything else. Haha I know I'm a wuss sometimes. Anyway... The ceviche was FABULOUS. It was super fresh and like I mentioned before, super flavorful! I tried my friends Tacu Tacu dish and it was also awesome! Both dishes came with a very large portion! Neither of use could finish our plates. So, my only dislike was how expensive this place is!! It's defiantly a dinner place and not a lunch spot. I ended up paying 30$ (including tip) for just my lunch. To me that's pretty steep for lunch... for dinner I wouldn't mind paying that much but woah!!! I'd love it if they had a lunch menu with smaller portions for a little less expensive. All in all my experience was a good one and I'll be back but only for dinner.\n",
      "We ended up in this restaurant with a search in yelp. This is a great place overall: customer service, cleanliness, nice environment. The food is fresh and the portions are huge! My mom and I will be sharing next time; had a lot of left overs. I really want to go back to have some pisco sour :) Parking is hard as the store is facing 7th st and there are only 5 to 6 spots in the front; so park in the back and come in. Main cross roads are 7th st and McDowell. Head north on 7th street and it will be in the corner of Virginia - NE corner.\n",
      "Great, great little restaurant. Having traveled Latin America for a while I was excited to try some Peruvian food. And it was great. The beef cuts I had were one of the best marinated pieces of meat I have had. And for desert I had this Argentinean cookie called alfajore... It was great. I love small places like this that do good right and are simple. Will go back for sure.\n",
      "I really want this place to be good. I spoke at great length with the owner and I truly feel that this family has the best of intentions. It's heartwarming to hear about a family putting their son through college to become a chef. I've been here twice and can tell you that I won't be back unless significant changes happen. It all started off wrong. My girlfriend and I walked in to see a mostly empty restaurant. There was a large table with 13 seats that had a party of about 6 sitting and eating. We told the hostess that there were only 2 of us, and she seemed annoyed. She asked if we had reservations, which we didn't and her response was, \"well I don't think we have any availability.\" Odd seeing how the place was mostly empty. Luckily, a couple was just leaving the bar and we were able to grab a seat. For being a Peruvian restaurant, they don't have a single Peruvian beer available. The food is okay, but the rice wasn't cooked enough and was crunchy. The ceviche was perfect and had the perfect amount of spice. The leche de tigre was delicious. I asked for a glass of water and was given one fast enough. However, while sipping I noticed a sharpness on my lips. When I examined my cup, I noticed a large chip missing from the edge of my glass. I notified the waitress and she was barely interested. Not enough to replace it immediately. Odd seeing how this is a HUGE health risk. Chips like this are caused by laziness in the wait staff who scoop ice from the ice bin using their customers glass. Guess what? That chip is now somewhere in the ice bin. The entire rest of the night, I couldn't help but think of someone swallowing shards of glass. While sitting at the bar, I couldn't focus on anything other than the activity in the kitchen: the entire wait staff and cook staff were horsing around playing. It wasn't a single instance I saw, it was for the entire duration of my meal. It was incredibly unprofessional and distracting. Maybe the cook was too busy playing grab ass with his friends to cook rice acceptably. I truly hope the owner sees this review and cleans house. The girls behind the the bar are inattentive and don't care about the heritage of the food they're serving. Moreover, the owners son needs to get serious about his trade. El Chullo really has an opportunity to clinch the Peruvian food market in all of Phoenix. For now, I'll be going to Villa Peru\n",
      "BEST PLACE EVER!! Where do I start? Service was quick and hospitable. Our server, the owners son, was such a friendly guy and very helpful. My husband got the Tallarines with Seafood. Creamy pasta with tons of seafood! Totally worth the price. I was recomended the Escabeche de Pollo. Oh boy! Finger licking sauce and perfetly balanced dish. This place is legit and authentic. They take pride in their food and you can taste the love. The chicha was delightful. We were here on our anniversary and the experience was much more than I anticipated. Please come and fall in love with Peruvian food.\n",
      "Love the food! Excellent service. Highly recommend El Chullo Peruvian Restaurant.\n",
      "I lived in Peru for three years and this is the best Peruvian food I have had in America. Love it. Thank you for taking me on a wonderful trip down memory lane!\n",
      "This place is amazing! I came here with my mom on a Thursday afternoon which was fairly slow. Our server was very attentive & the food was fantastic! My mom had never had Peruvian before & could not stop raving about the yuca fries! I am a huge fan of their vegetarian menu & highly recommend the Tacu Tacu. My mom ordered the Carapulcra & thought it was delicious. She couldn't get over the rice pyramid! Will definitely be frequenting this place more often.\n",
      "This place is ridiculously good...so good I can't wait to go back there again. The parking is very limited, so be prepared to park in the neighborhood and walk. Trust me, you'll forget all about the parking situation once you try their food. We shared a causa rellena to start and it was surprisingly fresh and flavorful. For my entree, I selected the lomo saltado based on our server's recommendation and man, was he right - this dish is over the top good! If you have not yet tried El Chullo, get in there and give it a try...don't let the exterior of the restaurant discourage you from trying this gem of a restaurant!\n",
      "Peruvian food is eclectic. It's accessible. It embraces multiple cultures and influences from ancient Aztecs to contemporary and cosmopolitan Lima. It's both familiar and exotic. And when it's done well, it can be both hearty and elegance. Superb ceviche,followed by an equally great rice with seafood and shared a dish of green linguini with a pesto sauce that was delicious. Can't wait to go back to try more items.\n",
      "The lomo saltado, signature Peruvian dish, was quite disappointing. The papas a la huancaina was disappointing as well - I guess the sauce was fine but needed more of the expected Peruvian \"kick\" aka yellow chili. Finally, the chupe de camarones soup tasted good but only had 5 regular size shrimp and 1 jumbo shrimp in it - seriously I counted - so it was not worth the price :( I was so excited to try a Peruvian place in PHX but maybe because I was expecting to much I felt the place wasn't very good and would probably not go back.\n",
      "My favorite Peruvian restaurant in AZ! Peruvian food is probably the best in the world imo and this place sure does demonstrate that. Small restaurant but that makes it one of the best hidden gems in Phoenix. Ceviche, anticuchos and lomo saltado are a must! If you want to introduce someone to this kind of food, start here!\n",
      "Went with a meetup group to this place. It's so small, only a local would notice it. I'm really glad I went. While it seems to take forever to get meals, it seems because they really put a lot of care into the cooking and presentation of the meal. For a little place, they don't just throw the food on a plate, but present it with rice molded in pyramids or hemispheres; appetizers can be multilayered in cylinders...all colorful and super flavorful. But a number of the dishes do rely heavily on rice. The one I had, which was basically rice with brown sauce and mushrooms and beans with a few other veggies, had the unique taste that the rice seemed crispy on top, like it had been run through the broiler. I think it is these touches that may help take time to get the food. But the waitstaff is friendly and was more than willing to make suggestions to those at our table that knew nothing of the cuisine. Try the non-alc Peruvian drink...it is delicious, with a nice taste of cloves. I like the unique flavors and generous portions and very reasonable prices. Just don't expect to be in and out. Good place to come with others to pass the time and chat. I'm putting down \"NOT good for kids\"...because I don't think they'd have the patience.\n",
      "Amazing food with great flavor. The Ceviche was a medium and this German girl thought it was hot. But the seafood was amazing! The Beef Tenderloin was juicy and tender. The oce cream was unique and fabulous and the cookie melts in yoir mouth. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We will definitely return to find new favorites.\n",
      "Had a great dining experience here. Papa a la huanca was ok. The lomo saltado however was excellent. Well cooked, well seasoned with a hint of Garlic. I posted some pics below. The arroz con pollo was excellent as well, the cilantro was prominent throughout the rice and was well seasoned. I have been to many peruvian restaurants across the country, and this one is the best in AZ hands down.\n",
      "Parking is a little hard, they have limited space in front but have a parking lot in the back via an alley. The place is very clean and quant, I loved the decor! The menu is very easy to understand with descriptive and have a variety of options. The server was very nice and answered all out questions, he told me they make the meals with a medium spice but can request it to be more spicy. I would def recommend this place it's very good!\n",
      "My God, the flavors of the food were absolutey spectacular. Everything was AMAZING, and we tried more than a few plates. Love, love, love. Will definitely be coming back. I took off one star for service. When we got there it took a long time for anyone to even offer water, and we were extremely thirsty from the heat. When we were ordering I asked for an explanation about the food preparation and the waitress seemed annoyed that I couldn't understand the word in Spanish she was using and she just kept repeating it when I kept asking for a different explanation. The food took a while to come out. I will definitely come back though! The food is just so good!\n",
      "Delicious food, great service and wonderful pisco sours. They have great vegetarian and meat options. Highly recommended if you are looking for something different near downtown. The ceviche is incredible!\n",
      "Great service, great apps, great entree, great fruit juice, great dessert. It's so small that is you drive too quickly, you'll miss it. Don't be fooled by the look or location - this place is stellar.\n",
      "Flavors here are awesome. Everything is delicious. Great pisco sour too! Highly recommend these very authentic flavors.\n",
      "El Chullo is one of the few authentic Peruvian food locales in Phoenix and luckily for us, is absolutely delicious! The lomo saltado is a must, especially if this is your first experience with Peruvian food. But, you can't go wrong with the fish ceviche - the best I've ever tasted. The Chicha morada (purple corn drink) was also interesting and delicious. To top it off, the service was great. We'll definitely be back :)\n",
      "We were excited to find a Peruvian restaurant with vegetarian options, so decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it is family run. They were extremely warm and hospitable and the food was freshly prepared home style! Even the piscos were thoughtfully made :) We enjoyed our evening and would definitely go back.\n",
      "We went for Friday lunch. The food was of mixed quality. Agreed it;s a different cuisine but not worth the two hours( yes you read that right ) wait we had to do.\n",
      "Stopped in for bunch on a Saturday. The place is small, but cozy. The menu is small, but offers quite a bit of variety. We decided to split a platter for two. It came with fried sweet potatoes, fried pork, and tamales. All were very good. The sweet potatoes on the bottom did get a bit salty. We also threw in a Peruvian version of torta. Unfortunately, I can't actually remember the name of it. All in all, the place was excellent. Great service and great food. Definitely a winning combination. N*joy...\n",
      "My trip to AZ isn't complete until I come here. I HAVE to go every time I visit. This is the best Peruvian food I have ever had. Whatever you order will be amazing, I have had damn near everything on the menu.\n",
      "Found this place on yelp while in Phoenix and decided to to try it out as My husband and I love Peruvian food. Waited outside for 40 mins for opening time and there was a rush of people who entered together. My husband and I were the first to get it..... We seated ourselves and then noticed the servers attended 4 other tables before us.......small establishment so not a lot of tables and service was very slow. Finally got attended to and the food took an hour to come out. Highly salted and my husband lost his appetite after the long wait. The server was nice and apologized but I'm still giving one star because I can't understand how this establishment got such a high rating.\n",
      "Food was amazing! Service was awesome! Very friendly and customer oriented waitress. If you like spicy ask for the red home made hot salsa.....it had a good kick. The Pollo Saltado was delicious, the sauce mixed in with the rice and fries is so overwhelmingly good it was like a powerful blast of taste. We had an appetizer of cow heart skewers, they were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. They were paired with potatoes and the combination was outstanding! Definitely a good spot to try! I will be coming back and bringing friends!!!\n",
      "Consistantly very good. My wife is peruvian and I am very familiar with peruvian food. The food is better than many restaurants in peru. I love the anticuchos, and causas. The lomo saltado is great, arroz con pollo also. Escaveche de pollo was brilliant, but was a little too over spiced. Also loved the Lucuma ice cream. Solid 4.5 stars.\n",
      "My family has been here twice already. We love this place. The food and service is amazing. Very small but great quality. The food is authentic and they have a great bar as well. This is well worth you experiencing if you crave this type of food.\n",
      "Incredible meal. Excellent service. It was my first time eating Peruvian food and I appreciated the time the server took to describe the menu items. Wonderful cerviche.\n",
      "Dear El Chullo, you have just earned a huge piece of my eating out budget. Wow. From a Cuban girl, who is super picky about her Hispanic foods... the Shrimp Chupe... the best I've ever had....the Lomo salteado, what a wonderful guilty pleasure and yucca fries! I'm in food heaven. Thank you\n",
      "Best most authentic Peruvian food in town! Ceviche is off the chain! Food does take a while but totally worth it!\n",
      "I am from Peru and came to Arizona for vacation and I was surprised to find an amazing restaurant. I tried many Peruvian restaurant and let me tell you this one the best Peruvian food I ever tasted. Ceviche is amazing and customer service is awesome!\n",
      "Finally! This Peruvian joint is legit! We moved from the Bay Area in California a little under a year ago and have been searching for good and authentic Peruvian food and we're sooo very happy we found it here at El Chullo! Let me add, that in the Bay Area you have the gammit of delicious food options and even there a good Peruvian place was hard to find. So we were super surprised that El Chullo met and exceeded our expectations. 1. The ceviche was fabulous! Good amount of acidity, well prepared seafood, and it had all the fixings (corn, sweet potato, onion, etc.) 2. We split an appetizer plate of 3 fixings and all of them were delicious! The portions were proper size, and the prices were appropriate for the quality of food that was served! We will defninitely be back again. Lastly, we drove 30 minutes to get here and it was worth it!\n",
      "Come eat here! Food is amazing. Don't be fooled ... The place doesn't look like much, but everything we've had so far is great! I wanted to bathe in the escabice sauce.\n",
      "This place is amazing! I came here one evening when I was in Phoenix for work, very authentic vibe with a super friendly staff. I ordered the cause rellena & the chupa de camarones (seafood soup). I highly recommend!\n",
      "This is a small but cute restaurant there is additional parking in the back. Food is really good and very authentic. I had the ají de gallina (shredded chicken, potatoes and rice) make sure you leave room for dessert the alfajor\n",
      "First time here and the food is amazing! Try their appetizers they are delicious! And of course their seafood\n",
      "Bf and I have never had Peruvian food before. We're in Phoenix for a conference, and while here we went to visit my uncle, who's from Peru. Bf got in the mood to try out Peruvian food, and even though this place was closed the night we saw my uncle, we decided to try this place out anyway because of the Yelp reviews. I got the Arroz Chaufa- very good and enough for two with a Maracuya Sour. Bf got the Lomo Saltado with the chef's suggestion of an added egg (very helpful), which he loved. We shared a Yuca Frita, which was really good, and they were super nice and made a sauce without onions so I could eat it (allergic to onions). If we ever come this way again, we'll be sure to come back. And for all of you who live in Phoenix, definitely take the opportunity to check this place out!\n",
      "We loved the food at El Chullo always looking for food that reminds us of our child hood Peruvian favorite foods . The Lomp Saltado was amazing, Thank you We'll be back soon Joni Navarro\n",
      "This restaurant need not spend any money on advertisement. The food speaks for itself..loud and clear. I am not familiar with Peruvian food but if this is as close to authentic as it gets, I am a fan. Me and friends tried the Tacu tacu ( how can something that sounds so cute not taste good) and the fried rice. The food is well seasoned and flavorful. The service is very good and the portions are very generous. For desert we had the Leche asada and alfajores. I did not think i could like caramel before i had the alfajores. For drinks, try the pisco mango. This place deserves a first visit and then a repeat visit with those who havent been here ( thats how i was initiated!) .\n",
      "Omg... hands down the best Peruvian restaurant in Arizona!!! Yum... and I know, my wife is Peruvian ;)\n",
      "I love El Chullo! I grew up in Peru and I've had a hard time finding good Peruvian food in Phoenix but boy, El Chullo gets it just right! I would go more often if it weren't that pricey. I mean, considering it's a \"hole-in-the-wall\" type of restaurant, I think their dishes are a little overpriced. But it's delicious for sure!\n",
      "Food was so good I had lomo saltado and arroz com mariscos yummy and amazing people who work here they sang me happy birthday :)\n",
      "This was my first experience with Peruvian cuisine. Not knowing what to order, I went with the Arroz con Pollo, since it's your basic Latin dish. I was immediately hit with the flavor of the rice. It's as if they mixed delicious chimichuri sauce with white rice. The dark meat of the chicken was juicy and the skin was crisp. The onion garnish on the side even had amazing tangy flavor I've never had before. El Chullo took a basic dish and nailed it. On my second trip, I wanted to explore the menu so I went with the Escabeche de Pollo. That dish has become one of the best things I have ever tried. The sauce is the star of the dish with its amazing savory flavor. It magnified the juicy dark meat of the chicken. The dish also came with a pyramid of white rice, a couple of nicely crisped slices of sweet potatoes that paired nicely with the escabeche sauce, and those tangy onions I have come to love. Third trip, I had the Lomo Saltado. It's basically like loaded fries. Not bad. Appetizers, oh my. The Papa Rellena is amazing. It's a ball of mash potato that is filled with meat, hard egg, olives, and raisins. The outside of the potato ball is fried shut so it holds it's shape. Don't let the raisins stop you from trying it, it's not overpowering. Try this place\n",
      "My first time and I'm gonna bring everyone i know to this place! I've never had Peruvian cuisine before, so I can't judge the authenticity. However, I've had chicken and rice dishes in other cuisines and this is by far the most flavorful! People were friendly and helpful. I'm gonna be back soon for the cocktails!\n",
      "5 WELL-DESERVED STARS!!!! El Chullo is a small and unassuming hidden gem so we ended up passing it and having to turn around, but it was so worth it! Honestly, we had reservations and a Living Social deal at another Peruvian restaurant but ditched that place to come here because of the great Yelp reviews and SO GLAD WE DID! This place has both the best Peruvian food and the friendliest service of any Peruvian restaurant there has been in the valley for at least the last 20 years. We've tried them all (including some out of state) and by far this place has the best alfajores we've ever had- luscious creamy dulce de leche sandwiched between delicate creamy colored disks of flaky, buttery, goodness- oh my! I'm still dreaming about them. The lucuma ice cream and chicha morada are also must tries. The chicha morada was refreshingly smooth and light- almost like a fine wine. We also had the appetizer sampler, the tamal, the aji de gallina, the jalea mixta, and the bistek and tallarines verdes. Next time we'll order the papa rellena and/or the yucca on their own (the sampler sizes were pretty small) and skip the tamal. The warm welcoming friendliness of the family/staff made our experience such an exceptional one that we ended up ordering a lot more than we planned and enjoying ourselves immensely. We love supporting family-owned businesses and Esperanza and Chef Omar and his cute sisters are so nice they make you want to come back again and again- well for them and the Alfajores :). I only wish it wasn't 30 mins. away, but so good it's worth the drive.\n",
      "The food was delicious! We had the tacu tacu and a pork tamale as the appetizer. Everything was well seasoned and fulfilling. The only down side was the price. We went for lunch and paid dinner prices ($35 per person about, without a drink). The place is small, too, so I can see seating being a problem.\n",
      "I always love eating here. I've never ordered something that didn't taste amazing. Today it was the tacu tacu- so good! I've had the vegetarian and beef versions and they were equally tasty. Today I decided to order a juice withi lunch and tried the lucuma with milk. I highly, highly recommend this drink. It is a native Peruvian fruit that tastes so familiar, but you just can't place it. And the milk just takes it over the top (in a good way!) If you haven't eaten here yet, you're missing out.\n",
      "I've had my fair share of Peruvian food here in the valley. I'm surprised that there actually are so many to choose from. Out of all of them, I believe that El Chullo has the best food of them all. I've had their ceviche, lomo saltado, and jalea. All of which were excellent. I would give it 5 stars if ratings were based only on the food! Not only does it taste great, it even is presented beautifully. Now, what brings this place down is the location. My biggest gripe is the A/C seems to not always be running cool. Not to mention it isn't the nicest looking of restaurants. For the price I expect a bit more class. Not super fancy, just a touch more. And yes, it's central Phoenix. So parking is tight.\n",
      "The restaurant is small, but clean, Good food, and exceptional service. I definitely recommend it.\n",
      "AMAZIING Peruvian food!! They make an awesome pisco sour and the ceviche was incredible! You have to get the lomo saltado!\n",
      "The service was great, and fast. Everything we had- ceviche, anticuchos, lomo saltado, and causa rellena, were all excellent. Just wish they had some kind of happy hour. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "Came here for the pisco sours after watching an episode of booze traveler. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the drink is, very sweet! I ordered the cilantro chicken soup, it was delicious. The soup tasted just like homemade chicken soup with a cool green color! Would definitely recommend for date night or small (2-4) groups!\n",
      "I will start by saying my wife is from Lima, Peru. We have been all over the world finding local peruvian places to eat (military family). This place is amazing! Small place but gives a family feel to it. U can smell the spices while the food is cooking. Amazing rocoto sauce and cebeche was awesome as well. Everything tasted like it was from Peru. Will go back again.\n",
      "Passing through Phoenix for one night and was so excited to find a Peruvian restaurant nearby. They are generally few and far between out here in Arizona! So I was excited to try it out but my experience was just... meh. Maybe I should have stuck to the tried-and-true like ceviche or Lomo saltado or aji de gallina, but I was developing a cough and a sore throat so I wanted chicken soup, and so ordered aguadito, a cilantro-based chicken soup on their menu. It was much too salty and the broth was literally green instead of being clear - though that's probably the way it should be, I don't know because I have never had this particular soup before. The ambience is that of a little hole in the wall family-run restaurant and the service was fine. If the opportunity presented itself I might go back to try some of the mainstay menu items, but I wouldn't run back.\n",
      "Flavorful, fresh food; friendly staff; charming decor that evokes Peru. An excellent choice for those looking to try a new cuisine.\n",
      "Been meaning to write post for months. Dated a Peruvian for over 5 years and been in Peru many times. This place is not your run of the mill Peruvian spot. Authentic food with a gourmet touch. Look forward to returning\n",
      "Hanna was marked as number 2 in phoenix it should definitely be number 1, amazing food, amazing service unlike most places in phoenix.\n",
      "My parents were stopping through town on their way home to Tucson and we decided we wanted sushi. I used good 'ol Yelp to help us out and found this place. Very good. The sushi tasted fresh with just the right amount of sauce. My dad got a yakisoba dish and it was also very good. The veggies were so fresh and had a little crunch to them. I will be having some great leftovers. I take off 1 star only because their sushi selection seems a little short. I did notice they had some specials on the board, but I would have loved a longer list.\n",
      "Just finished an incredible dinner at Hana after many months of hearing about how mind blowing the food is. Here's what I have to say: I can still taste the flavors of each dish and sushi medley in my mouth and on my teeth! My tongue is so happy - and so am I! The service was attentive, the food peaked my interest and Lori (chef/owner) challenged me to push beyond my comfort zone and try new things. The result? A new-found passion for favors I've never experienced and a love of uni shooters! Anyone looking for an authentically beautiful/playful dinner - go Hana!\n",
      "Definitely the freshest fish places I have ever eaten. I love the fresh fish bento box!\n",
      "I went to Hana expecting wonderful sushi. It wasn't. There were some very enjoyable things about Hana, and although it wouldn't be my first choice, I would go back if the choice was up to someone else. The location is very convenient. The place is small, and comfortable. It looks inviting, and the employees are friendly. They have a very interesting menu, but I had sushi only on this visit. The sushi is served in a decorative wooden boat. Everything was very fresh, but not what I hoped for... The sushi was not bad, it just wasn't great. It was a bit loosely rolled, and fell apart too easily. They used fake crab instead of the real thing, but did not make that clear on their menu, and they did not have a couple of the things on their menu. I was really looking forward to their tamago. They had not made any that day. The waitress who corrected my order and refunded the money I was charged for the tamago was not happy. It didn't seem to bother her that an item on their regular menu was not available, and I had been charged. What bothered her is that she had to correct the sale and give me back the overcharge. It wasn't the best experience, but as I said, the food was very fresh, and except for that one waitress, the employees were very nice. I will probably give the place another try, it just won't be for a while.\n",
      "I've been there twice and both times were exceptional. Everything is so fresh there. The Uni, Ramen, and fried chicken (appetizer) are so delicious! The Uni at Hana is the best!! I didn't have room for desserts the last two times, but I will definitely make room next time.\n",
      "Friday night and it was packed. While we were there at least one party was always waiting. Thats the sign of a good eatery, so we thought! We had the following: -Bento Box (Sashimi cuts were generous but the I dont think it can be compared to the the freshness of the stock in DC metro or Vancouver BC or Singapore scale). California roll was just bland. Tempura was greasy and had a funny smell. Salad & Miso was average. -Fiery tuna roll was worse than our local supermarket pre-fab. Absolutely no taste, more like a blob. - Octopus tempura was too greasy and a funny oil smell. - Pan Fried Soba: plenty of veggies but what a bland prep! Bottom-line: You can pick up better plates in a plastic box from your supermarket isle. To be fair, I cannot compare this place to other local joints. My reference scale may not be calibrated to the right standard. Looking at the wait list I cant tel that its all yelp hype. May be this is the best you can get in the middle of a desert. My expectations were not in line. So if you are from near the coasts and have refined Japanese palette, pass HJE and look for Mexican food while you are this close to the border.\n",
      "Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, this \"one star\" rating is based upon the shockingly cruel service we received from our server, and not necessarily the food. A group of friends and myself dined here on a Saturday night (February 2nd, 2008). There were eight of us out to celebrate our friend's birthday. Hana does not accept reservations and it was busy, so we did have to weight about an hour and fifteen minutes for a table. Totally understandable, and I do not fault the restaurant for this at all. However, when one of the servers directed us to our table and we started to sit down, another server yelled at us to get up because he wasn't done placing the settings (we did not know this). This was the beginning of the abuse. For the remainder of the meal, this particular server (a stocky, young guy with black hair) proceeded to treat us as if we were an inconvenience to him. He threw menus at us, and would only return to the table for the briefest of seconds to see if we were ready to order. When it took more than a few seconds for us to poll the table, he would walk off in a huff. One of my friends did not see the water that the server placed at the end of the table, and so when he asked for water, he was yelled at. Another friend who asked for a side salad with his sushi was told simply \"no.\" (a bunch of us just shared with him). We all enjoyed the sushi. My husband did not enjoy his ramen soup (the broth was really briney). When the server asked him if he wanted to take it home, my husband said, \"no thanks.\" The server asked him directly if he didn't like it, so my husband said, \"not really.\" But then assured him that everybody else really enjoyed their dishes. The server then replied, \"everybody else is welcome back, then.\" This was not said humorously, by the way. The server would not let us split the bill on several cards (although it was almost $300) and so my friend, who's birthday it was, had to chip in for us to cover the bill. You might ask yourself, why not just leave the waiter a poor tip to send a message on the inappropriateness of the service? Well, because our party was large, gratuity was included. In fact, I think the server knew this from the start and just decided to treat us terribly knowing that he would pull a $25 tip either way. This was so embarassing, given that this was a friend's birthday. I had a cake waiting in the car that I was going to ask the restaraunt if they would let me serve. Given how mean the service was, we decided to abandon that idea and just head across the street to Mary Coyles for dessert. It's wierd, I've encountered bad service before, but never just downright cruel. I'm wondering if the owners know about this guy's behavior? So all in all: good sushi, but not worth the abuse. Maybe this is a better restaurant for one or two people to just sit intimately? I'm really bummed about my experience since I had read really positive reviews.\n",
      "Amazon food, super friendly staff. Love this place! The baked salmon roll was amazing! There's s something elegant about the simplicity of Hana. They stick to the basics. Good food good service. I'll be back for sure. Also the byob concept makes it a lot of fun. ;]\n",
      "We went here two nights in a row. The food was great each time and the service was the best ! First night we were inside ( 3 people) second night on the patio (7 people). They warmed up the sake we brought and served it to us in the little sake bottle.\n",
      "We took the trip up from Chandler to try this place and it was well worth the trip. The quality of the fish and the cuts were perfect. The attention and service was amazing. I would say this is the best sushi experience in the valley. Can't wait to return!\n",
      "The fish are fresh and the service was excellent! Probably the best sushi I've had in Phoenix!\n",
      "So very Delish! The only thang......the lobster roll....needed spice! A pop! Something! So, I ordered a side of sirraicha...now I'm happy!\n",
      "OMG. Great Place for sushi! I thought the BYOB was a joke but when I got there it was real. They do not serve alcohol! They are cool with you bringing in whatever you want to drink though. The sushi was of excellent quality. Wait staff were cool. Place is too small though. The albacore was simply amazing!\n",
      "We went to Hana again and were rewarded with yet another wonderful experience! We went for a birthday party and had about 8 people. I love that when you walk in they yell out the traditional greeting. It reminds me of Monsters Inc at Harry Hausens... I know a kid at heart. I enjoy being able to bring my own wine, sake or beer. We ordered the pot stickers and the fired tofu as apps and I love their pot stickers. It was a first for the fried tofu which was quite good. Kind of like fried cheese... mmmmm. There were a few uni shooters with some very pleased pallets and a few quail eggs shooters with the same happy taste buds around the table. Mike had the Ebiyakisoba (shrimp noodles, I can't spell it to save my soul) which are tasty! There was a steak at the table and it was quite good. And then the sushi! We ordered the chefs choice $80 platter of sashimi then about the same amount in rolls. The salmon was rich and buttery, the tuna succulent, the striped bass was excellent, I didn't get any of the scallops but everyone said they were great! For the rolls we had the dragon roll, the shrimp tempura roll and I can't remember the last two rolls because the champagne and wine had started to take effect. All were wonderful! One the downside the space REALLY needs an update... it has been a few years and the Ikea touches need to go. I know in most Asian restaurants the food comes out when it comes out. Meaning the hot dishes come out first, or your apps come out last and Hana is no different. Unfortunately the waiter who used to get it and would put the orders in timing them so everything would actually show up when it was supposed to is now gone. He is the cute Rock'a Billy dark haired gentleman over at Windsor. He will be missed if only because he understood and was proactive in making the experience great. But knowing this is just how it is and expecting in advance helps. Overall a great experience. For 8 people the food and tip were right about $220 not bad for really good sushi! It is a must if you like or love sushi!\n",
      "OK really? All you haters can head right on back to the safe zone of Zen-32 where they make americanized versions of sushi and japanese food because the wait will be less! And seriously, you complain about BYOB (yeah, it really sucks to pay a third of what you would in a full service restaurant) and they don't even charge a corkage! Awesome! On to the food: The poke they gave us when we sat down was INSANE...i could have eaten it all night. The fresh wasabi was great, I think I want to put it on all my food, all the time. The fish was seriously fresh and they had some really great unique stuff. Their special rolls were amazing, and we can't wait to go back and try all the specials they had on the board. The Service: I love their people, they were super fast and friendly... Keep doing what you are doing Hana...you have a unique product and we LOVE it!\n",
      "Really good place if you are in the area. Neat little mom and pop kinda place. Had some take out pork ramen with an egg and some dumplings. Really good stuff. Excited to go back for sushi.\n",
      "Lots of high quality fairly authentic Japanese food to choose from. In addition to just rolls and sashami, they do offer various hot dishes, udons, and appetizers. Their fish is fairly fresh, especially compared to many other sushi places in the area. I see the appeal in BYOB, but I sometimes wish they offered drinks instead.\n",
      "Best Japanese restaurant for Gyudon Sukiyaki! The service is excellent, could not ask for a better place for sushi or traditional Japanese Food.\n",
      "Hands down, best sushi. Hana is our \"special treat\" place.\n",
      "Awesome sushi spot. Very low key atmosphere. We had the California Roll and Shrimp Tempura. I definately recommend stopping in for a nice roll!\n",
      "Sushi lovers and non-sushi people can have an exceptional meal here, for a great price with wonderful service. And (lucky for me) in my neighborhood. A gem!\n",
      "This place is the real deal! My bet for the best sushi in town. Thoughtfully prepared and creative. Also, the tempura udon is delic!\n",
      "Wow!! Great Service, Fresh Sashimi I will Definitely go back!! no liquor license so Bring your own Beer or Wine and they will provide a glass:-))\n",
      "This has become my standard for all sushi to be judged. I have not had a bad item here. Rainbow carpaccio is a must try. Its sashimi of 4 or 5 different fish with a cucumber relish. Prices are moderate but with a free BYOB its easy to overlook that. The tempura is light and prefectly crisp. I've only had one noodle dish I think. So I cant judge too well based on that. But what I had was excellent. Service is always great.\n",
      "giving two stars is very over doing it for this place. I have been here several times and I thought it was great the first tie and the second not so great and I had sat up at the bar then. Too noisy but then it is a small place with tables close to each other. I had terrible service for being a suday night outside and not very busy. I coud not even get them to bring over napkins till almost thru the fishest sushi I ever smelt and not appetizing at all. All in all an experience that will make me say NAY NAY.\n",
      "Definitely worth the wait!!!! The staff is awesome, chef is amazing and FYI bring your own wine bc they have no bar.\n",
      "BEST. SUSHI. IN. PHOENIX. Seriously, it's so good. I wasn't a huge \"sushi person\" before coming here and now I find myself craving it once a week. The staff is so friendly, it has a great \"family owned\" vibe. The service is always so speedy and best of all the food is AWESOME....wait did I say how great the food was already? Anyway - if you are in the valley and looking for some authentic, fresh, sushi - Hana is your place!\n",
      "i have never had fresher yellowtail, the spicy salmon was fantastic! I am a sushi fanatic and was thrilled to discover this little restaurant. They also allow you to bring your own beer! I can't wait to go back!\n",
      "Great service! Great sushi! Will surely come back again. I like it when a \"Japanese\" restaurant can speak Japanese.\n",
      "I have been here a few times, both for lunch and dinner. It's a small, looks like mom and pop type of place. I have had their bento lunch with the sashimi, tempura, and I think it's a California roll along with some traditional Japanese veggies. The sashimi is always fresh, and the tempura is fried to perfection. The California roll is good, but from my other reviews, you will notice I don't really care for sushi that way. The service is adequate, not that great and not bad. Definitely well worth eating here.\n",
      "Top quality sushi restaurant! It was easy to slip in for an early dinner on Friday evening, we were seated quickly at the sushi bar. Excellent service from everyone and delicious food. I will certainly be going back, often!\n",
      "Best sushi I have ever had, hands down. I thought I was going to be so dissapointed that they didn't serve alcohol, but nope! The food was so damn good that it doesnt even matter. Love the idea of BYOB, just have never tried it before. Huge servings, healthy, tasty, my favorite was the Las Vegas Roll. Holy hell. Amazing.\n",
      "Quelle joie d'avoir découvert ce restaurant. Il est à une minute à pied du bord de l'eau, assez spacieux et confortable ce restaurant est une merveille. La carte est très généreuse, le service fut efficace et ceci n'est pas un détail les plats étaient excellents. Le poisson était fondant en bouche. Pour finir les prix sont tout à fait correct. Le tout etait très honnête. J'allais oublier, dans ce restaurant il y a des box de Bois avec des banquettes à l'intérieur. On peut les fermer avec des drapées pour plus d'intimité. Cela a beaucoup amusé mes filles :) bref pittoresque en plus.\n",
      "Been here twice -- one time for dinner at the sushi bar and the second time for take out and both has been a very mediocre experience. The location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It's the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away. My dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was. I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings. The restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn't feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I've found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn't seem to be actually hamachi and I found their \"hamachi\" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy. The two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV. The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer's comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting. The cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish. I decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn't have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed). Next time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen's Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well.\n",
      "The sushi here is pretty good. I've gone over lunch time with my colleagues since it's near our office. The problem is that they're slow as molasses. You can expect a work lunch to run almost 2 hours even if the restaurant is reasonably empty. Not the best.\n",
      "Not impressed with this place at all! I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time. The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross. The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible. The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular. And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting. I would pass on this one.\n"
